  "overview": "What could be cuter and more entertaining than children's words and reactions? Nothing? That's good news: in the new family game Les petits tannants, hosted by Pierre Hébert, it's just that! In a studio that looks like a colorful games room equipped with hidden cameras, Pierre Hébert will be accompanied, for each program, by a well-known personality, including Anne-Élisabeth Bossé, Marie-Soleil Dion, Cynthia Wu-Maheu, Mario Tessier, Maxime Landry, Claude Cobra, Mathieu Baron, Alex Perron, Antoine Vezina, Phil Laprise and Phil Roy.",
