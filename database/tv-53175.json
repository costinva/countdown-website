  "overview": "Jerusalem follows events in the lead up to the Jewish fast of Tisha Be'av (the day of mourning over the destruction of the Jewish Temple) and the Muslim celebration of Eid al-Adha (the holiday of the sacrifice) - which by rare circumstance fall on the same day.Superintendent Amir is a man fluent in Arabic, knowledgeable about Islam and Christianity, and able to walk the tightrope between the different faiths and remain unaffiliated (and yet, affiliated with everyone), all with a single goal in mind: to maintain the status quo, unfortunately at the cost of neglecting his own family. We follow him as he and his fellow officers race to prevent a devastating atrocity in the heart of the ancient Old City.",
