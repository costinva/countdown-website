  "overview": "There are a few turning points in a woman's life; a new job, marriage, giving birth. However, dating, love and sex never become easier regardless of how old you are. This is a drama needed by women nowadays that have so much to say, but have no one to talk to. It brings up deep topics people are curious and want to hear about. Four inflection points in life; 23, 29, 35, 42. We challenge ourselves to tell a promiscuous story that other dramas couldn't through the four stories about four people of different ages.",
