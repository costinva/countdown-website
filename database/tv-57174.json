  "overview": "In the wee hours inside Hersheypark, brave confectioners navigate the eerily deserted amusement park, solving clues and riding spooky thrill rides before using classic Hershey candy to create mind-bending, chocolatey showpieces inside Hershey's largest candy store, Chocolate World. The chefs mold chocolate like champs and spin sugar into gold in an all-out, fight-or-fright competition hosted by Sunny Anderson.",
