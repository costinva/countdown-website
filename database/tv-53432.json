  "overview": "\"What do you absolutely want to do before you turn 12?\" It's the question the children's channel Ketnet asked their viewers a few years ago. The result was De Blacklist: a list of children's wishes and dreams. Ketnet helped these wishes come true. But not every child got their wish... Some checks that children had submitted, Ketnet thought to be too dangerous, too crazy or simply impossible. These checks became The Blacklist, a list Ketnet rather wanted to forget. But not if it's up to Tom Waes!In The Blacklist, host Tom Waes faces 6 'impossible' checks and tries to make these dreams come true. Making a looping with an airplane, blowing up a building, getting married, crossing offroad with a 4x4, build a life size candy house and directing a horror movie. Will he be able to tackle this Blacklist successfully? ",
