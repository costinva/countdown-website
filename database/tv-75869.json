  "overview": "In the Somarriba family everything seems to be going well, but it only seems that way. The Galgo Group, the family business that has seen three generations grow, is going through its worst moment and everyone around it is looking to take advantage. The crisis in the sector, the imminent arrival of the sugar law and the lack of leadership of Emilio, president of Galgo since his father died, are shaking the company's future. So Gonzalo Díaz, after years of working alongside Emilio, sets out to implement his own plans for the company. The one neither of them counted on was Carmina, Gonzalo's wife and also heir to the group as Emilio's sister. In a turn of events, Carmina makes a unilateral decision and unleashes a family and business earthquake that will also affect her children Blanca, Guzmán, Jimena and Julián. Interests and power struggles separate them and Carmina will have to choose between saving the company or saving her family.",
