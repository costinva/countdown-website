  "overview": "Meet the Richardsons is a comedy series offering a fictional window into the funny and frustrated marriage of stand-up comedians Jon Richardson and Lucy Beaumont. The pair play exaggerated versions of themselves as viewers get a glimpse into their home and work lives, surrounded by their celebrity friends and Hebden Bridge neighbours.Jon and Lucy find out what their neighbours really think of them, the type of birthday party they should have for their daughter Elsie, and Jon's constant refusal to do or go to anything, much to Lucy's annoyance (that part isn't exaggerated).",
