  "overview": "Faut pas rêver is a discovery program broadcast in prime-time on France 3. It is presented alternately by Carolina De Salvo and Philippe Gougler, with seven unreleased issues each season. After venturing into all areas of the world, the show has - since the start of the 2019 school year - the focus on the regions of France. It is characterized by encounters with strong characters who live, and share with our presenters, original and sometimes unusual situations! Do not dream, it is a positive and human light and a different perspective on our country. ",
