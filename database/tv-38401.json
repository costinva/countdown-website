Sight Unseen features Borland, best known as the guitarist and backup vocalist for multiplatinum rock band Limp Bizkit, and his fiancée, fellow musician Carré Callaway, tackling a massive whole-home renovation. The couple purchased the seven-bedroom art deco mansion after seeing only photos of the property. Throughout the series, Wes and Carré experience the ups and downs associated with such a major re-do project. As they transform the forgotten property into their new home, they feel more confident that they made the right move.",
