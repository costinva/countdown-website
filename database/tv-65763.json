  "overview": "Mild-mannered Martha's Vineyard bookstore owner George Stoody turns a new page in his life (and gets a bad paper cut) when he meets his daughter-in-law's dad, Leo Wagonman, an abrasive, smalltime hood on the run from Las Vegas mobsters. Leo hasn't seen his daughter, Casey, in 20 years, and she likes it that way, but George's well-meaning son, Ted, has invited him to their wedding -- and once Leo sees that there's a spare room above George's shop, he decides that he has found the perfect hideout.",
