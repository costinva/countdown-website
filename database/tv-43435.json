  "overview": "Why Did You Come to My House? is a variety show that delivers the parties at stars' houses when they play freely without any cuts scene. Expectedly, the program will show the image of a real party with the noisy, bustle without following the concept of housewarming parties which are just for visiting and praising as before.",
