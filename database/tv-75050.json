  "overview": "The prestigious Roldán family is surprised by the arrival of a stranger, introduced by Sara, the family's grandmother, as the granddaughter they have rescued from a marginal neighborhood. She is the supposed daughter of Sergio, his youngest son, murdered ten years ago in strange circumstances that remain unsolved. Luisa Mayorga is a beautiful young woman who will become part of this greedy family, which for the most part is opposed to accepting her, causing the imbalance and confrontation of all its members. As the days go by, the supposed granddaughter is not as harmless or weak as she seems, because behind her movements there is a dangerous group led by a sinister character who seeks destruction and revenge against the Roldán family. For all who know her, Luisa Mayorga will not go unnoticed, and in the end they will understand why she has been the chosen granddaughter.",
