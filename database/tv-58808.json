  "overview": "A Gay Victorian Affair is a period comedy following the sexy, queer escapades of Lord Reginald and Lady Vanessa Favershum, a gay man and lesbian woman in a marriage of convenience in Victorian times. Their marriage allows them to hide their proclivities from society while indulging in them in private and, with the aide of their butler and maid, quite often covering for each other, when decorum requires it!",
