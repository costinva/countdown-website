  "overview": "Alone: The Skills Challenge pits 3 former Alone participants head-to-head to complete incredible bushcraft builds using only basic tools and the natural resources around them. Their goal: to prove who has the ingenuity, experience and wilderness skills to craft the most unbelievable survival build. From elevated shelters to hand-crafted ovens to watercraft, participants will give their all to amaze former Alone participants who will judge the builds. Just like Alone, challengers will self-document their experience but this time on their home terrain.",
