  "overview": "July 2014. When Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 crashes in Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, the circumstances are shrouded in mystery. With a regional war beginning to rage around the crash site, disinformation is everywhere. Western governments are left scrabbling for detail while one civilian is leading the hunt for answers â€“ Dad of two and amateur blogger Eliot Higgins. And with an unlikely team of online detectives by his side, he's ready to fight all the way to the truth. Combining the geopolitical stakes of NAVALNY and LOCKERBIE with the pulsating internet sleuthing of DON'T F*** WITH CATS, this gripping documentary series follows the 21st Century's most politically significant plane crash - an international David vs. Goliath narrative following a bunch of unexpected heroes who risked their lives to fight for justice.",
