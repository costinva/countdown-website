  "overview": "Over four episodes, host Sandra Lee pits nine of the best gingerbread artists in the country against each other to create spooky gingerbread masterpieces that embody the season. Judges Jamika Pessoa and Jason Smith are joined by rotating judges, including the \"Mistress of the Dark\" herself, Elvira, to determine the winners of the first three heats, who will square off against each other in the finale for a chance to win the ultimate Halloween treat -- $25,000 and to be featured in Food Network Magazine. But beware, these aren't your grandma's cute gingerbread houses. With surprises lurking around every corner, these wildly haunted original creations tell a darker story.",
