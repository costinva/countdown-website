  "overview": "Unlike romantic newlyweds, Karan and Nithya are the awkwardly newly married couple who just shifted into their new house.They get a warm welcome from their neighbours Mr. and Mrs. Sharma which is too warm for their liking. Things get chaotic when the Sharma's leave their 7yr old grandson, for a day with them. The kid makes our couples life hell but ignites a bond between the two.",
