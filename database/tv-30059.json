  "overview": "Every scar has a story. Inspired by the popular user generated clips of crashes, wipeouts and accidents that permeate the internet, Scarred is an inside look at some of the most gruesome scars from around the country. Each week, we'll track down some of these makeshift stunt men and women to find out what went wrong, what happened in the hospital, and how they got Scarred. This show is almost too painful to watch.",
