  "overview": "Monica Everett, the Silent Witch, is the world's only practitioner of Voiceless Magic, a veritable heroine who single-handedly fended off the Black Dragon of legend. However, the young prodigy is actuallyâ€¦super-duper shy! Yup, turns out she only learned Voiceless Magic to avoid speaking in public.
