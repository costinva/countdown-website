  "overview": "The series is produced by NHL Network in association with NHL Original Productions, and it will not only showcase the over 50 players vying for 23 roster spots, it will also have plenty of content on notable veterans, including Taylor Hall (the reigning Hart Memorial Trophy winner as NHL MVP following a 39-goal, 54-assist season) and Brian Boyle (the reigning Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winner for his inspiration comeback from leukemia). And the Devils are making a preseason/start of the season trip to Europe, which will see center Nico Hischier (the first overall NHL draft pick in 2017) return to his native Switzerland for an exhibition game against SC Bern and forwards Jesper Bratt and Marcus Johansson return to their native Sweden for the Devils' Oct. 6 regular-season opener against the Edmonton Oilers. The cameras will be there to cover all of that.",
