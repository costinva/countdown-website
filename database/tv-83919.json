  "overview": "The People vs Michael Jackson takes us inside one of the biggest celebrity trials of the century - the 2005 criminal trial of the music legend and icon, Michael Jackson. Drawing upon court transcripts, hours of never-before-seen home video, and more than 30 interviews with jurors, attorneys, celebrity witnesses, reporters, and observers, this documentary is not just a saga about family, celebrity and the media, but also a story about how wealth, privilege, and power affected the pursuit of justice. ",
