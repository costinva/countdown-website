  "overview": "Anders lives a suburban life with his wife, daughter and dog. He has a good job, a habitual relationship: everything should be fine. But Anders left his dreams a long time ago and feels trapped in the well-polished suburban life. The couple's dinners, the renovation chatter, the holiday chatter and the middle-class lies lie up in his throat. When one day he sees his daughter in isolation, he feels that he has had enough. Desperate in his longing for change, he begins to harass his neighbors.",
