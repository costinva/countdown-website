  "overview": "Cristóbal Balenciaga makes his debut as a designer in Paris, but the designs that set a trend in Spain don't work well in the sophisticated empire of fashion where Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy set the trends. Guided by his obsession with control in all aspects of his life, Balenciaga will define his style and end up becoming the greatest of all.",
