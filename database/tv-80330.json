  "overview": "RAP:PUBLIC invites you to a hip-hop survival world you have never seen before. It's a real hip-hop survival show where the participants compete and survive using rap as their weapon. The rappers form their own 'blocks' and compete as a team to survive in a society disconnected from the outside world. In this society where cooperation and competition coexist, they can only decide their fate through games that use rap. The final winning block will be given 300,000 dollars as a prize and become the first owner of RAP:PUBLIC.",
