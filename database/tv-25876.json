  "overview": "Over the last 5 seasons, 52 Perfect Matches were made, but that was just the beginning. From matches who fell in love to ones who insist they're only friends to pairs who never got the chance to fully explore their connections, the beams don't lie. There's something (perfect) between these matches! So now, they're getting a second chance to finally figure out why they're a match and win some more money together.",
