  "overview": "Participants literally sail to an uninhabited island to get its treasures. All the heroes are divided into three tribes according to the elements of water, air and earth. They will not only have to survive in unusual conditions for a whole month, but also pass tests to get resources, immunity or other bonuses. Each episode, the heroes gather in an amphitheater, where they decide who will leave the game. Only four will make it to the final, and only one of them will be able to take the island's treasures for 10 million rubles.",
