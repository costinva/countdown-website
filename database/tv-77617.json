  "overview": "Behind the facade of the prestigious clinic there is a landfill for illegal organ transplant operations. Many find themselves drawn into the criminal world of underground transplantation — some of their own free will, others not. A successful surgeon who compromises with his conscience in order to finance ambitious scientific research. A simple graduate student who happened to be next to him and was trying to save a loved one. A crazy journalist who had nothing to lose after a fatal diagnosis — now only a transplant can save her, but officially you can't wait for your turn. Everyone is immersed in the hidden world of organ trafficking, illegal migrants and clandestine surgery. Everyone has their own story and their own aspirations. But they all find themselves hostage to circumstances in which it is impossible to remain human, it remains only to choose who to be — a predator or a victim.",
