  "overview": "Families raising adolescents with Tourette syndrome, a tic disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements and vocalizations, allow cameras to document their remarkable stories and exceptional triumphs. The kids range in age from 11 to 17, and along with aspirations, friends, rivals and homework, each has Tourette syndrome. The six-part documentary shows how the children and their families not only handle turbulent ups and downs but also are resilient and thriving despite dealing with an often-misunderstood disorder.",
