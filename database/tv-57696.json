  "overview": "Every year, Gaviota and her mother arrive at Hacienda Casablanca to pick up the coffee from the second harvest of the year, but they hope that their next visit will be their last, because from now on they will be owners of their own land. However, fate has other plans. Octavio Vallejo, the owner of the hacienda, has just died. Gaviota previously had saved him from a kidnapping. Octavio promised as a reward to give her one hectare of land so that she could grow her own coffee. Trying to get the Vallejo family to honor the agreement, Gaviota meets Sebastián, Octavio's son, and an irrepressible attraction is born between them, a heartbreaking, impossible love, becoming two lovers who belong to different worlds. Then, something good happens to Gaviota that will change her life forever.",
