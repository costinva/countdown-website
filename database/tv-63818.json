  "overview": "B&amp;B by the Sea is set in a Victorian guesthouse at Downhill Beach on the picturesque Antrim coast. The tranquil setting is a place of calm and it's a chance for celebrity guests to explore their connections to the sea and coast - but it is not all rest and relaxation, as Sharon and Rory from the B&amp;B team put them through their paces. Our celebrities also slip on their aprons to help Great British Menu chef Alex Greene prepare a gourmet meal using the best of local produce that audiences will be keen to try at home.",
