  "overview": "Snatchers is about Sara, a status-obsessed high school student, who, to preserve her social standing, has sex for the first time and unexpectedly wakes up pregnant...really pregnant. Things take an interesting turn the morning after she loses her virginity when she quickly discovers she's pregnant with an alien baby screaming to get out. Now she'll have to team up with her nerdy ex-best friend Hayley to fight against an extraterrestrial threat, and hopefully keep her mom and friends from finding out about her alien offspring.",
