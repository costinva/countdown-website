  "overview": "In 2003, when a small mining town in Ningxia faced relocation, a burned female corpse was discovered outside the police station. The circumstances of her death bore a striking resemblance to a brutal unsolved case from a decade earlier. Veteran detective Zhu Zhiqiang, nearing retirement, teamed up with Zhang Tao, who had been transferred to the mining town's criminal investigation unit due to a work-related mistake. Together, they worked to unravel the case, uncovering the tragic truths buried in the town's past as the relocation unfolded.",
