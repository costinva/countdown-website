  "overview": "In 1969, life in San Francisco consists of free love, communal living and political protest. Freewheelin' Franklin Freek, Fat Freddy Freekowtski, Phineas T. Phreakers and their mischievous, foul-mouthed cat, Kitty spend their days dodging many things — the draft, the narcs and steady employment – all while searching for an altered state of bliss. But after partakking of a genetically mutated strain of marijuana, the Freaks wake up 50 years later to discover a much different society. Quickly feeling like fish out of water in a high-tech world of fourth-wave feminism, extreme gentrification and intense political correctness, the Freaks learn how to navigate life in 2020 — where, surprisingly, their precious cannabis is now legal.",
