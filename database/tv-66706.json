  "overview": "Danya comes from the provinces to Moscow. He dreams of conquering the capital and becoming a popular stand-up artist. The guy has a lot of ambitions, but there is no roof over his head. In search of housing, he decides to rent a room from Vyacheslav Sokolov, a boring and offended old man. The relationship between Danya and Vyacheslav is initially very tense, but then it turns out that they have a lot in common: in the past, Sokolov was a popular Soviet satirist. Their unexpected friendship will help Dana gain faith in herself, and Vyacheslav will get another chance in life.",
