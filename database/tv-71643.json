  "overview": "Luz en la oscuridad is another step in the genre that combines the experience of Carles Porta and his respect for the victims and those involved in the cases with an elegant narrative and subtle and very careful filming and editing. The title of the series is the narrative and formal concept that directs the chapters: shedding light on the dark parts of our society with the story of crimes that have happened in recent years in Spain.",
