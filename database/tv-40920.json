  "overview": "Narrated by EmmyÂ®-winner Sir David Attenborough, Seven Worlds, One Planet is a brand new ambitious seven-part landmark nature docu-series. Each one-hour episode will transport viewers to a single continent and tell the story of its spectacular wildlife and iconic landscapes. Millions of years ago incredible forces ripped apart the Earth's crust creating seven extraordinary continents.This series will reveal how each distinct continent has shaped the unique animal life found there. We will discover why Australasia is full of peculiar and venomous wildlife; why North America is a land of opportunity where pioneers succeed; and what the consequences are for life racing to compete on the richest of all continents, South America.",
