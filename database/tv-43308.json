  "overview": "For a full year we will follow the life and jobs of Belgian F-16 fighter pilots with their operations above enemy territory, exercises abroad and their daily jobs on airbase \"Kleine Brogel\". For the very first time are those elite pilots prepared to testify about their job, their world and their life. In F-16, a reporter series of VTM Nieuws, opens the Belgian Air Force their doors for the first time to a world full of secrets and supersonic fighter jets.",
