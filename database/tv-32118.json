  "overview": "The Novak family has decided to buck the trend in urban flight and move back to the city from the suburbs. The only place that meets their space and price requirements, however, is a building in downtown Chicago that would best be described as a \"fixer-upper\". Undaunted, the Novaks move in a try to make the best of things. Some of the family, particularly the young kids, adapt, while some, most notably their teenage daughter, don't.",
