  "overview": "The highly satirical sketch show 'Bandera Smoothies' was created after the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation army on the territory of Ukraine in February 2022. The author of the idea was a well-known Ukrainian theatre and film actor, screenwriter, director, and Merited Artist of Ukraine Dmytro Surzhykov, and Andrii Zaiets is working on the project as a director.Despite the fact that each episode of the sketch show lasts only about two minutes, in the wake of the patriotic upsurge, 'Bandera Smoothies' became very popular, attracting the attention of the audience, including due to its dark humour. An important role in this is played by the fact that well-known Ukrainian actors, including Stanislav Boklan, Vitalina Bibliv, Nataliia Koretska, Olesia Zhurakivska and others, participate in the filming of the 'Bandera Smoothies' sketch show.",
