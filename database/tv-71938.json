  "overview": "After Spain did not qualify for the final phase of the 1992 Euro Cup, the Spanish Football Federation appointed Javier Clemente as national coach. A coach, the one from Barakaldo, who had just won two Leagues with Athletic Bilbao and led Espanyol to the UEFA final. A lover of English football, the new coach puts together a physical and brave team that is the opposite of the beauty of Johan Cruyff's Barça that was beginning to set a trend at that time. Beyond styles and after an agonizing match against Denmark, Spain made it to the 1994 World Cup in the United States and for the first time in a long time it is being talked about as one of the favorites to lift the title.",
