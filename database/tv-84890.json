  "overview": "Four directors, twenty gripping stories, a kaleidoscope of genres from thriller to comedy. Each episode is an hour of real time that the viewer will live together with the characters of the series. An hour that will become a turning point in the characters' destinies, an hour after which nothing will be the same as before...The format of \"The Last Minute\" is unusual: there are no through characters, no single story. The episodes are separate short stories, the plots of which develop in real time. The characters live ordinary lives, they have their own concerns, affairs, work, family and secrets. But life can make a sharp turn in an instant, and then everything turns upside down. The secret becomes clear, friends - enemies, chance encounters - fatal... How will the characters of the series act? How will it all end? Who will be the winner, and who will have to part with life? Everything will become clear only at the last minute...",
