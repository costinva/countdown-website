  "overview": "He is the nicest teacher in the Netherlands, Mees Kees! Slightly lanky and clumsy, but also sweet and funny. His way of teaching is different than usual, but makes him a favourite with all his students. The young teacher mainly does fun things in the classroom, with the intention of teaching through play. The school director, Dreus, often disagrees with this and does not always appreciate it. Fortunately, Mees Kees can always count on his energetic students when faced with challenges, who know how to solve everything with their creativity, humour and enthusiasm!",
