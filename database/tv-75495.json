  "overview": "Five first-year students move into the legendary 510 block of the Moscow State University dormitory. There they will be met by Pavel Vladimirovich Zuev, who decided to return to the university to make it the best in the country again; the new commandant of the hostel Tamara Mikhailovna — Zoya Mikhailovna's sister; her wayward assistant Kisel; \"dumpling king\" Kuzya, who became the main sponsor of the Moscow State University, and Vika Bobr, who plunged into teaching after parting with Anton Martynov. The guys are waiting for all the same problems: studying, relationships and finding themselves. At the same time, it is important not to forget that being a student is the best years of life, and try to \"learn not to worry about trifles.\"",
