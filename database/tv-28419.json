  "overview": "Blind Date, the nation's favourite match-making show, is back for a brand new series.Hosted by Paul O'Grady, the show has been updated for the 21st century, as a new generation of love-seeking characters compete against each other to hook up with their potential love match, hiding behind the legendary sliding panel.Paul O'Grady commented: \"Blind Date is an incredibly special family show which brought laughter, tears and joy to TV viewers throughout the land. I am honoured to present the brand new series and, after speaking to Channel 5, I know the series is in safe hands. I can't wait to see if we can find love.\"With no chance to swipe left, send a selfie or message back, the class of 2017 must break with modern day dating convention and rely on their basic instincts to find the chemistry.Whilst paying respect to the traditions and family appeal of the programme with the legendary sliding panel, three question format and live studio audience, Blind Date will be updated to reflect the present day, whilst maintaining the humour, charm and cheekiness of the original show.Blind Date will also welcome LGBT contestants for the first time and there'll be thematic twists which will breathe new life into the series.",
