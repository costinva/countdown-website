  "overview": "From dense rainforests to remote coastal regions, each episode offers a rare and intimate look at one animal. On the Great Barrier Reef, QLD, Dr Ann comes face-to face with a heavily pregnant bull shark, and in the Pilbara, WA, she goes fishing for deadly, mysterious sea snakes. In the steamy heart of Borneo's jungle Dr Ann looks for wild orangutans; and in the Dampier Archipelago, WA, she meets three species of turtle. In Moreton Bay, QLD, Dr Ann helps catch a dugong for an onboard health check, and along the edge of the Kinabatangan River in Borneo, she hunts for one of the weirdest mammals on the planet, the scaly, labrador-sized pangolin.",
