  "overview": "Aistear an Amhráin returns to RTÉ ONE this autumn to explore the stories behind some of Ireland's most loved and popular songs.  In this four-part series, Reporters, Garry MacDonncha and Sinéad Ní Churnáin explore the social and cultural history, the myths, and the often-quirky tales associated with these songs, in the company of fans and music lovers and with those who have made these anthems what they are.   Series two features the heartbreaking ballad \"Grace\" made famous by the late great, Jim McCann, we track down the woman who was immortalised in The Frank and Walter's great love song \"After All\", we hear the story behind Séan Ó Sé's groundbreaking Irish language chart-topper \"An Poc Ar Buile,\" and Spandau Ballet's 80's anthem \"Through the Barricades, which Gary Kemp was inspired to write following the tragic death of band roadie, Thomas Reilly. ",
