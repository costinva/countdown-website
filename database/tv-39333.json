  "overview": "The Other Two follows a 29-year-old aspiring actor wondering why he can't get better auditions than \"Man at Party Who Smells Fart,\" and his 30-year-old sister Brooke, a former professional child dancer, who aspires to be anything other than what she is right now. As the two siblings work towards finding themselves, they must also confront the dueling emotions of envy and pride brought on by the overnight internet fame of their younger brother, 12-year-old Chase.",
