  "overview": "We are in the mid-1980s, at the end of the Cold War. Charged with the most perilous missions, the FBI agent Red Ketchup succeeds in them every time. The impressive stature of this colossus with red eyes and orange hair is enough to make his enemies tremble. With zeal and casualness, he takes all the risks necessary to achieve his ends, even if it usually involves major collateral damage. The FBI, who consider him a burden, send him on a distant mission hoping that he will never return. But Red Ketchup always comes back!",
