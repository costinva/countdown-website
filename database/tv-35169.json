  "overview": "Kanaga explores metaphysical and transcendental worlds by following the story of Mardin Tamay, a 38 year-old quantum physicist, on a journey of his life. While looking for his father, a world-acclaimed archaeologist who has supposedly been dead for 30 years, Mardin will find himself and his powers. Everywhere he goes, he'll encounter the unexplainable, esoterism and magic, but also love and truth.",
