  "overview": "Ten contestants from all walks of life - from professional chefs and home cooks to social media influencers - are isolated in a secret underground kitchen labyrinth connected by a series of conveyor belts. Guided by a mischievous animated talking hat, the chefs are tasked to perform a series of cooking challenges. However, there are no judges, and the chefs must rate each other's final dishes in blind taste tests. With their true identities concealed, everything will be hidden except the one thing that matters most ... the food.",
