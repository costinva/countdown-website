  "overview": "Rewind to the 1980s and female singer Chu Sa-kiu raises her twin daughters in Lau Fau Shan by herself. Regrettably, the grown-up twin sisters then turn against each other because of their lovers. Sa-wah runs away from home, and Sa-sa dies during childbirth. Sa-kiu has since taken up the important role as her granddaughter Kwan-ho's carer. She has also fostered a little dumb boy called Man Chor. Time flies and Kwan-ho's father Chuk Chin fai's appearance causes Sa-kiu, Sa-wah and Kwan-ho's relationship across three generations to again get entangled in the realm of ambivalence. Because of fate, Man Chor , Kwan-ho and fresh-faced and competent Szeto Lai-shun become buddies, resulting in a happy sibling relationship gradually becoming incestuous. And they face a conundrum as they also get involved in an abusive triangular relationship. They resort to making sacrifices and selfless contributions to let their beloved find happiness.",
