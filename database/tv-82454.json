  "overview": "As a child, Eşref fell in love from afar with a girl he called \"Rüya\" and spent years searching for her, only to become a powerful mafia figure along the way. Meanwhile, Nisan, an idealistic musician, finds herself in grave danger after performing at a wedding held at Eşref's hotel. Eşref falls for Nisan, unaware that she is both the long-lost Rüya he has been chasing for years and a police informant. Trapped in a whirlwind of love, betrayal, and power struggles, Eşref is forced into a brutal reckoning — both with his criminal empire and his own emotions.",
