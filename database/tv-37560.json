  "overview": "Kaede enjoys a lot being with her friends. But when Christmas comes up, all the singles feel a certain pressure. And this pressure also reaches her, especially as her job is to write good slogans to sell Christmas cards used to convey love. Sadly, because she is not in love, her work performance also suffers. And that is how her friends come up with the perfect plan: send a message to all the contacts in Kaede's mobile phone, and the one who answers first is the one she should approach to have a date with.",
