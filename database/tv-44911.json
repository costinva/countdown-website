  "overview": "Game On! pits two teams of three, captained by Venus Williams and Rob Gronkowski, with comedians Bobby Lee and Ian Karmel and a rotating mix of sports stars, comedians and celebrities, against one another. The teams will go head to head in over-the-top physical challengesâ€”from seeing who can dunk the most basketballs over a tank of water while harnessed on a bungee cord, to taking on a sumo wrestler in the ring. They will also have their sports-related knowledge tested with trivia questions.",
