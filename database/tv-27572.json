  "overview": "Super Garden returns for a brand new series, featuring five budding garden designers who are competing to showcase their green-fingered talent at Ireland's premier garden festival, Bloom by Bord Bia.Each of the designers will be allocated a real garden to transform, with real challenges to overcome. With a tight budget and just five weeks to meet the homeowner's needs and build a Super Garden worthy of a spot at Bloom, the series follows each designer from the initial concept and design stage, through the reality of the construction process to the all important judging day.The decision of which Super Garden will be recreated to represent Woodies and Cuprinol at Bloom 2017 lies in the hands of the Super Garden Judges; Bloom Show Manager, Gary Graham, Bloom Gold Medalist and Woodies Garden Design Ambassador, Leonie Cornelius and representing Cuprinol, garden design lecturer Monica Alverez.",
