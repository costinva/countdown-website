  "overview": "The short story bestseller by Ferdinand von Schirach as a six-part anthology. In terms of content, all the stories revolve around the deadly abyss of punishment and punishment, guilt and (self-)justice: marital drama, psychological thriller or also as a crime thriller told backwards â€“ always with surprising twists and punchlines. Moral conflicts make it clear that law and justice are two very different things - and many a guilty person gets \"punished\" with legal impunity.",
