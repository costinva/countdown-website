  "overview": "Who decides what kindness is? Santa Claus encounters a surprising problem at the forge: The gift warehouse is overflowing with packages that are in danger of not being delivered. It seems that this Christmas, almost no one will meet the requirements of the Great Book of Kindness, written by the overly cocky elf Hörö. Kindness Crisis at Korvatunturi is a family-friendly situation comedy that mixes suspense, crime mystery, and infatuation in the freezing cold.",
