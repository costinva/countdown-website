  "overview": "Each of the six one-hour episodes of The Motherhood follows Britton, a single mother herself, as she connects with another single mother who is juggling the demands of work, parenting, and self-care.  Over the course of a transformative week, Britton and three expert coaches (AKA The Neighbor Ladies)—DIY and home design specialist Angela Rose, positive parenting coach Destini Davis, and style expert Taryn Hicks—help the mom create a harmonious living space, implement effective parenting strategies and refresh her wardrobe.  At the heart of the series is the lasting impact of these changes, as the women build a supportive community to continue uplifting each other long after the cameras stop rolling.",
