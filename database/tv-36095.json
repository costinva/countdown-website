  "overview": "Mother Nature is more powerful than any man-made bomb and is more ferocious and destructive than any army. Film-maker and adventurer Chris Terrill is fascinated by extreme situations and in this brand-new series he confronts nature head-on, going right to the core of the world's greatest storms to explore unique human experiences of severe weather. Without a crew, Chris goes alone, with just his camera, into life-threatening situations, confronting high-speed tornados, ferocious hurricanes and deadly firestorms. And he meets the people who live and work in the path of these killer natural forces.",
