  "overview": "The focus is on Levi Strauss, who comes to San Francisco in the mid-19th century during the gold rush to try his luck. The son of a Jewish peddler from Upper Franconia was to become one of the greatest pioneers in American history. Together with Jacob Davis, a Jewish tailor from Riga who is almost the same age, he develops the blue jeans that will forever be associated with his name.",
