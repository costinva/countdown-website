  "overview": "The special features an exclusive interview with Carolyn Warmus, as well as the Greenburgh PD investigator who worked the case from beginning to end; Westchester County, New York prosecutors; jurors and reporters who covered the story first hand. All reveal what they thought about the case then and how they view it now. Throughout the in-depth special, Warmus, who never testified in her own defense on the advice of her counsel, shares her truth. She has always maintained her innocence. With no physical evidence to support her guilt, those who investigated the case and worked to secure her conviction offer the circumstantial evidence that led to Warmus' sentence. While Warmus' first, grueling, months-long court ordeal ended in a mistrial, she was retried and convicted soon after.Â ",
