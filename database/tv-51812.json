  "overview": "In 2020, there is one theme that has overshadowed everything else - the pandemic. When Norway shut down, we turned on the cameras. Through unique access to decision makers, companies and various people, we have documented how we have all had our lives affected by a virus. We are close to the government and health officials who talk about some of their most difficult decisions. We see how nurses, teachers and entrepreneurs deal with a brutal reality with great upheavals and fears, and we follow Hurtigruten who is trying to maneuver through its biggest crisis ever. The result is a surprising, close and personal story about how we as humans and nation have lived under the threat of the coronavirus.",
