  "overview": "Clumsy Luckkana has always considered herself unlucky. In the hopes of bettering her life, the deeply superstitious Luckkana often seeks fortune tellers. And she believes them unquestioningly. So when a fortuneteller insists that her ex will change her bad luck, Luckkana is determined to find Chokebordee, her nerdy school love. But the ugly duckling became a swan—or in this case a handsome, smart man. He is so transformed that Luckkana almost doesn't recognize him. When she does, how will their love story continue? ",
