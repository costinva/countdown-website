  "overview": "After hitting a bump on the road, a magician's stagecoach drops a crate containing a magical Rubik's Cube, which is magically animated and speaks. Three children find and take care of it. But trouble stirs up when the magician finds out that his magical Rubik's Cube is missing. He decides that there is only one way to get back Rubik. And that is to steal the cube from the kids. But the children (and Rubik) always foils the magician's plans. Rubik has magical abilities, such as flight, when his cube colors are aligned.",
