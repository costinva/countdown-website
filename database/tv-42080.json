  "overview": "Fresh from his success on the series \"Bar Rescue,\" Jon Taffer turns his attention toward couples on the verge of splitting up and uses his unorthodox approach to help them mend their relationships. He applies similar tactics to a diverse group of spouses, ranging from newlyweds to couples who have been together for decades. To allow the couples to escape any distractions from the daily grind of their lives, Taffer transports them to a five-star beach resort in the Caribbean to put them through a series of tests. After the tests, couples either leave the show together or opt to part ways.",
