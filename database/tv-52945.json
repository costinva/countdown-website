  "overview": "We live in the United States of Surveillance - with cameras positioned on every street corner and much more invisible spying online and on the phone. Anyone paying attention knows that privacy is dead. All of this is not happening by accident - well funded powerful agencies and companies are engaged in the business of keeping tabs on what we do, what we say, and what we think.",
