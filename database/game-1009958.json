Playing as robots who simply pick up objects and put them back down(sometimes in a throwing fasion) you compete to see who is the best.Â In rounds jam packed with physics objects, power ups and a few missiles, you must use everything around you to show your skill. Whether as a robot, mini-fridge, vending machine or other square-ish appliance, fight the odds and become a master at what you were designed to do.Fight in either local or online multiplayer games, with a variety of levels and characters to choose from.Muddy Creek Games is a small one man studio hoping to make silly, fun and \"homegrown\" experiences for all.",
