  "overview": "The First World War is ravaging Europe. By contrast, Davos, the noble spa town in the Swiss Alps, seems like an oasis of peace. But behind the scenes, neutral Switzerland takes centre stage in a relentless battle between the secret agents of the world powers. The young nurse Johanna Gabathuler unexpectedly gets caught between the fronts of the spies: to win back her daughter, she gets involved in a deadly game with the German Secret Service â€“ and suddenly becomes the tip of the scales in a risky plan that decides between war and peace.",
