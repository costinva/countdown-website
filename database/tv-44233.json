  "overview": "Paul Shaffer has mastered the art of captivating conversation from his seat at the piano on the Late Show with David Letterman. Now, the renowned bandleader and four-time Emmy nominee will further hone his chat chops with the launch of Paul Shaffer Plus One on AXS TV! Shaffer will be sitting down with some of music's finest including Sammy Hagar, Graham Nash, ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, Steely Dan's Donald Fagen and more to discuss everything from inspiration and influences to notable songs. Of course, a few impromptu performances will also be thrown into every show. According to the man himself, \"In this show I get to go one-on-one with all my favorite recording artists. We talk mainly music and if the topic turns to a specific tune, we demonstrate in song. It's a dream come true.\"",
