  "overview": "Far from supporting psychologist couches find Petter Schjerven out why we humans are who we are and, most importantly, why we do what we do. A playful Schjerven gives us a deep dive in the human mind - without self-help books, or Freudian psychoanalysis. Through fun examples and tests of man in the street, the program shows that we are not always who we think we are, and that even our picture may not grounded in reality.",
