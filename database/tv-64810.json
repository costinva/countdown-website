  "overview": "For food truck owners, Eddie Jackson's Rosehill Beer Garden is the hottest spot in Houston. Each weekend, three new food trucks compete for a chance to face off against the resident Rosehill food trucks to win a permanent spot. It takes fast ticket times, great personalities and showstopping food to impress Eddie, but the worst performing truck has to pull up stakes and head out of Rosehill for good.",
