  "overview": "In Amazingness, Dyrdek will introduce the world to the most ridiculously talented young people in the country â€“ an eclectic and diverse mix of amateur and viral talent, who compete to earn the top spot. The first act goes to the Top Spot, but every following performer has the opportunity to dethrone them. After each performance, Dyrdek and the judges will decide who stays on top and who gets dropped. The last one standing will have the \"Amazingness\" of a champion and walk away with $10,000 dollars in cash.",
