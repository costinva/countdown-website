  "overview": "There is a microchip in the food of the Helsinki kindergarten. A young journalist, Johanna, begins to figure out how the chip has ended up in the commercial kitchen. The bank branch manager makes a bad investment decision. Covering up the error leads to another and soon Marianne is in a pinch. The Korvola family is trying to cope with the disappearance of a father who worked as a border veterinarian. It has been almost a year since the boating accident. Transport is a report on pan-European crime. It's about ordinary people under a lot of pressure.",
