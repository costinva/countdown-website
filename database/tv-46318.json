  "overview": "Momay is 2000 years old. For centuries she has never aged, never gotten sick, and never died. Having tried hundreds of methods to kill herself over and over again and always failing, Momay finally sees a ray of light at the end of the tunnel when her friend, Krateng, who is a fortuneteller, tells her that she will be able to age and pass on if she finds the love of her life within this year. The problem is... there are four candidates. Thawin —her hardworking and generous boss, Khun Prom, — who is their company's biggest client, Kampun —a sweet young man, and Moo Tod —the dashing new guy. Four candidates and one year to find the love of her life. But who's the right one? ",
