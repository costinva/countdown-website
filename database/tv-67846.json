  "overview": "Themis is known as the goddess of law and order in Greek mythology. This story takes place at a law school where students aspire to become judges, prosecutors, and lawyers. Hiiragi Shizuku, who is both a judge and a law teacher, is confronted with the reality of the law school, where the teachers are only interested in teaching students how to pass the bar exam. With her belief that \"one cannot become a good lawyer if you do not know people\", Shizuku decides to create a new trend in the law school by teaching the students how to learn more about \"people\", which is something that cannot be learned from textbooks.",
