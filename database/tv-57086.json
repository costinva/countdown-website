  "overview": "In the series Rus, Leo Ajkic tries to understand more of what makes intoxication so digg for some, but dangerous for others. Among other things, he is a fly on the wall during drug treatment, meets survivors who have lost someone after an overdose, but he is also present when the Russian buses roll in intoxication of joy. The documentary series is based on an extensive insight work where the editors have talked to young people from upper secondary schools all over the country about their experiences with drugs and what they really wonder about drugs. In the conversations, it became clear that they think parents know too little and that adults such as police and teachers can quickly become moralizing and judgmental, while friends and enthusiasts tend to discredit the use of alcohol and other drugs.",
