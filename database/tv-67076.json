After activating a memory that lasted twenty years ago, not only fighting skills return, but also a daring character and a love of spectacular outfits. In the company of a colleague and brutal ex-fiance Makarov, you have to find a traitor and choose one of the lives: a homemaker and a dentist's wife or a spy and a superhero girl.",
