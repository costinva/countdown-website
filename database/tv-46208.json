  "overview": "Don't ever tell a 75-year-old to go quietly into the night. Hey Lady! is about a wiry old gal with a whiskey voice and a bourbon appetite, who refuses to let herself be put out to pasture. In an age when age is often the problem, Lady is a testament to the life force. Episode after episode, Lady finds herself at the centre of some absurd and very public embarrassments, requiring the assistance – and sometimes the bail bond – of one of her tired and overworked middle-aged children. With the assistance of her friend Rosie, Lady goes on an off-the-charts rampage of urban vengeance, upturning everything in her path – social norms, rules of etiquette, even the series itself.",
