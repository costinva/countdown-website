  "overview": "Tengo que morir todas las noches is a snapshot of the sophisticated and exclusive gay nightlife of one of the most emblematic clubs in 1980s' Mexico City, where people living under the weight of a repressive society that marginalized them felt the need to express an exacerbated sense of freedom. Through the eyes of a young man eager to explore the world and live freely in the capital city, the series recreates a slice of life and a decade that shook the world.",
