  "overview": "Welcome to the world cup of cooking and battle ground to determine whose food is the best on the planet. French or Italian; Greek or Lebanese; Indian or Chinese; Vietnamese or Venezuelan?Ten teams from across Australia representing some of the greatest food nations will cook from their heart and heritage, transporting you around the globe through international dishes which excite and inspire to determine which cuisine will ultimately reign supreme.Serving up the flavours of the world in this spicy food fight, teams will cook side by side with two countries going head-to-head in each episode, armed with long-held family recipes and the pressure of generations to do their heritage justice. Teams will put every ounce into creating dishes to impress the judges and out class their competition.Facing off in a state-of-the-art kitchen in The Arena, a foodie's paradise of gardens, orchards and greenhouses overflowing with pristine produce, the winning team will progress immediately to the next round. The losing team will face an elimination challenge.After the first round, five teams will be closer to realising their food dream, and five teams face an uncertain future. At the end of the competition, only one team will be left standing - The 2020 Plate of Origin Champions - with $100,000 in prize money and the knowledge that their cuisine reigns supreme.",
