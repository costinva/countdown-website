  "overview": "Since time immemorial, dark forces have been flattering themselves with the hope of conquering our beautiful planet. But every time they are opposed by heroes who stand up to defend their Motherland. Just such a hero lives in St. Petersburg. He is the most powerful and strong. He is so old that he himself has forgotten his name, so everyone simply calls him Nevsky. Once upon a time, it was he and several other heroes who stopped the countless armies of Pestilence, the conqueror of worlds. But the evil did not disappear, but hid in order to accumulate strength for a new invasion.",
