  "overview": "The Japanese 38th South Pole research expedition team are at the Dome base. Located 1,000 km away from the main Showa base at an altitude of 3,800 m, it is called the most inhospitable place on earth with an average temperature of -54 deg Celsius. No living thing or even a virus can survive in such an environment. Three of the seven-member expedition team are researchers and the remaining four are support personnel. However, they are common men who have to live together in the confined space of the Dome base for one year. The only joy they can speak of is the time when everyone eats delicious food. There is little else except starkness, oppressiveness, stress, anxiety, apprehension of living in such extreme conditions with nowhere to escape to and no one to rely on besides fellow team members.Â ",
