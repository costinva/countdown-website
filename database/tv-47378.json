  "overview": "Coming to you from 123 Sesame Street, it's The Not Too Late Show with Elmo! Every week, before your favorite 3 1/2-year-old furry red monster puts on his jammies and brushes his teeth, he squeezes in his own not-too-late talk show, where celebrity guests come over to play fun and zany games and sing some of the all-time best jams. With Baby David at his desk, Cookie Monster as his trusty sidekick, and a rockin' house band, plus an enthusiastic studio audience of humans and muppets cheering him on, Elmo interviews the biggest stars in movies, TV, and music in 15-minute episodes that feature familiar Sesame Street faces working to keep the show running smoothly. Join Elmo as he dusts off his cutest suit to bring his infectious laughter, curiosity, and love to your home.",
