  "overview": "At 17, Xin lived a simple life in Macau. She enjoyed exploring the “world” with her DV camera, understanding the value of ordinary life. However, everything changed when she met her senior schoolmate Fei, who brought a new rhythm to Xin’s life. At 22, Xin embraced a free life in Taiwan, studying journalism and living with her girlfriend, Qing. Despite seeming ordinary, her life was also marked by graduation uncertainties. Xin wanted to stay in Taiwan but faced obstacles, and returning to Macau meant confronting her family. At 34, Xin lived a busy life shuttling between Hong Kong and Macau. Anxious to break free from the curse of being an assistant director, she felt pressured by her eligible actress girlfriend, Bei, to become independent. Facing external worries and internal conflicts, Xin finally realized that embracing her true self and being carefree might be the best way to survive.",
