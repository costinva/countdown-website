  "overview": "\"Big Brother to Kids\" Wang Huanyu, \"Dancing Queen\" Wei Xing, \"Shop Heir\" Han Shuai, \"Quirky Girl\" Guo Ting, and \"Literary Scholar\" Shi Wenke are childhood friends who grew up together on \"Universe Street\" in a small seaside town. In the senior year of high school, both the low-achieving students Wang Huanyu, Han Shuai and Guo Ting, and the academically-inclined Wei Xing and Shi Wenke are caught up in the uncertainties of their future. In the clash of growing pains and the ignorance of youth, they gradually mature. Youth years are like a battlefield, but as long as the people you care about are by your side, you have nothing to fear. In this year, the teenagers with different personalities and mutual attractions each go through a unique experience of joy and sorrow brought about by kinship, friendship and ignorant love. In the midst of hesitation and confusion, they carefully find their paths, guarding their own original aspirations and relentlessly striving towards new pursuits.",
