  "overview": "Ann Bryant is on a mission to save Lake Tahoe's black bears from their biggest threat: people. Every summer, human-bear conflicts escalate as thousands of tourists flood into the region and come face to face with the black bears that call Lake Tahoe home. Dozens of bears are killed each year after encountering people, and Ann and her team of volunteers face an uphill battle as they try to maintain the peace. Armed with an arsenal of paintball guns and rubber bullets and dressed in her trademark head-to-toe black, Ann is on the frontline of this extraordinary conflict. This year brings one of Ann's toughest and most emotionally challenging summers yet as she fights to save the creatures she believes she is destined to protect.",
