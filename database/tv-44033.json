Alison Brie (Mad Men) plays a just-off-the-bus Midwesterner who lands a job at \"Scenarios\" -- a nightclub where \"anything can happen.\" Will she prevail and realize her dream to become a dancer, falling in love along the way? Endless cleavage, girl fights, and an 800-pound disco ball. All in one slutty nightclub.",
