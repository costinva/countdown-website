  "overview": "The demon princess Zhao Yue, who had originally only set revenge as her goal, found herself entangled in an unexpected scandal on her wedding day. The river god Ruo Xiao crashed the ceremony, bringing along a child. Before anyone could react, Zhao Yue's fianc√©, the demon lord, flew into a rage over being \"cuckolded,\" unleashing a thunderstorm and throwing knives at his bride. Zhao Yue was utterly baffled, unable to understand why the ancient god would barge into her wedding with a child, and she firmly denied any connection to either Ruo Xiao or the child. However, wary of the complications involving a child, she quickly assessed the situation and decided to \"flee with the child\" for now. During the escape, memories of a long-sealed past slowly resurfaced. Beneath the absurd chaos lay a deep and enduring love that had remained unresolved for a hundred years. It turns out that years ago, by the cold waters of Qingying Pool, the ancient god Ruo Xiao, moved by compassion, had fallen for a wounded demon woman who had descended from the sky. However, he gave his body and mind to the wrong person and ended up raising a child alone for five hundred years, waiting for his wife to return. As the truth comes to light and their love reignites, they must face an impossible choice. On one side, the love is too deep to suppress, and on the other side, the gods and demons are on different paths. How will they decide their fate?",
