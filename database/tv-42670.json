  "overview": "Tough Cookies takes detective hotshot Cliff Brady and brings him to Chicago's rough and tumble southside. His mission? To walk the beat. The fact that Brady grew up in this neighborhood makes his assignment more interesting than usual. And more hysterical too, because the characters he meets are more often than not some good old friends. Like Rita, owner of the Windbreaker Bar. Or dapper Danny Polchek, the neighborhood bookmaker and erstwhile wiseguy. How do you apprehend a culprit only to discover he's an old friend? Very carefully and with lots of laughter.",
