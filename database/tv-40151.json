  "overview": "Smiley Face Killers: The Hunt for Justice follows an active private investigation spearheaded by retired NYPD Detective Kevin Gannon and his veteran team of investigators as they work with victims' families and top forensic experts to further investigate and question that the country's most notorious string of mysterious, accidental drownings aren't accidents, but homicides; and they could all be connected to a larger theory of The Smiley Face Killers.",
