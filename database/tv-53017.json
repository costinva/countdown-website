  "overview": "Belle Collective centers on the personal and professional lives of five successful, glamourous boss women who are redefining what it means to be a southern belle in Jackson, Mississippi. These dynamic women represent Mississippi's finest Black female entrepreneurs, determined to break ceilings–glass and otherwise–while shredding long-held stereotypes of the South. They must set aside their differences to redevelop a struggling mid-twentieth century historic district that was once known as the hub for Black-owned businesses. ",
