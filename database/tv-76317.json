  "overview": "News is discussed here because it is the most fertile environment for jokes. The participants of the comedy show, masters of improvisational humor, laugh only at current events that worry people and occupy the first lines in blogs. The topic of the program could be the launch of the hadron collider, the permission of cloning in Australia, or the election results in the United States.",
