  "overview": "A Question of Love explores what happens when couples decide to take a major step in their relationship – moving in together. The series will follow three couples, all at different points in their relationship, who will ask each other a series of questions designed specifically to highlight the truth and the spaces between them. With guidance from relationship expert and certified dating coach, Damona Hoffman, these ‘questions of love' give each person the permission to ask questions they may have never asked on their own. Over the next several weeks, viewers will watch as they cohabitate and see whether the revelations have helped or hurt their chances for a successful relationship.",
