  "overview": "When Metal Ruled the 80s celebrates the peak years of glam metal as the productions became glitzier, the hair grew bigger and the parties went out of control as leading bands would stop at nothing to outdo their competition. By the 1980s fame and notoriety of metal bands was at a saturation point and individual band members were starting to become world famous leading to infighting that threatened to bring down the biggest bands.",
