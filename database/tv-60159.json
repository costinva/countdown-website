  "overview": "One day Nino Sorrentino appears at the winery, an old friend of the landowner Matteo DeCanin. But Nino is more than a companion from Matteo's childhood days. He is part of Matteo's dark past, which took its fateful course in Naples. At the same time, a bad incident shook the idyllic life in the area: At night, a young woman was hit by a car on a mountain pass. Carabinieri Adrin Erlacher immediately takes over the investigation. Department head Christina Melauer wants to put the case aside, but the evidence piles up for the Carabinieri - especially when he finds the wine label for a 3000 euro wine among the evidence. The honest law enforcement officer investigates on his own. Winemaker Matteo is also the focus of his investigations.",
