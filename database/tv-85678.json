  "overview": "For the first time ever, 12 battle-tested survivalists take on a scorched, apocalyptic wasteland where they must scavenge ruins to survive in Naked and Afraid: Apocalypse. In locations long abandoned by humans, the survivalists face the franchise's toughest challenge yet as they endure extreme heat and drought as well as unpredictable lions, elephants, black mambas and more without food, water and clothing. Four teams are dropped into forgotten corners of South Africa – spanning a ghost town, a vehicle junkyard, a cemetery, and even a mine shaft – where they must scavenge the wreckage for resources. In a franchise-first, survivalists will not be extracted but must escape this wasteland and find their way back to civilization at the end of the challenge. All the while, they must also battle relentless threats from apex predators, endure punishing heat and navigate constant dangers from rusted metal and broken glass.",
