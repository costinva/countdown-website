  "overview": "When Jacques' daughter places him in a residence for the elderly, he thinks he is being sent to the slaughterhouse. He is far from suspecting that he will meet Rose there, desire her and be desired like never before. This real physical passion upsets those around them, questions everyone's libido and causes chaos within the residence. Despite the reluctance and prohibitions against them, will Jacques and Rose manage to love each other?",
