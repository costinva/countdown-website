  "overview": "Unlike anything you've seen in 2D or 3D, Scary Tales is a scripted series so weird and fantastic, it needs an extra dimension just to contain itself. There are marauding giants, ghost-plagued forests and human wolves... a place where cannibals feast, kidnappers terrorize and fiends lurk behind every tree. Inanimate objects come to life, and the innocent are punished. It's a world that really exists if only in our own subconscious.",
