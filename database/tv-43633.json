  "overview": "The Hairy Bikers fulfil a long-held ambition: to take on the world's most iconic road trip, America's Route 66, which spans over 2,000 miles of tarmac from Chicago to California. With a large helping of their signature warmth and humour, Si King and Dave Myers explore modern America via the ‘Mother Road' and learn how it drives you into America's past, meeting the communities, cultures and cuisine along the way. As the Bikers ride from place to place, they share their passion for good food and have some incredible experiences which give them the real taste of America. From joining modern day cowboys on a thrilling cattle drive through the vast prairies of Oklahoma and experiencing the staggering scale of the Mojave Desert and Monument Valley, to cooking with the Amish community and sampling the very latest LA food trends, the Bikers have an unforgettable adventure.",
