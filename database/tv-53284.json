She paints, writes songs, steals from stores, reads stand-up books, and doesn't give a damn about her older sister. The eldest, Rita , is an insecure employee of a glossy magazine who dreams of becoming a photographer. Through a clever manipulation, Iris deprives her older sister of her job and the abuser boyfriend, whom Rita held on to out of self-doubt. The older one is ready to kill the younger one for \"breaking her life\", but Iris comes up with a project in which both sisters will help girls who are dependent on their low self-esteem and do not accept \"flaws\" in their appearance. Phototherapy. Bodypositive. In this series, imbued with the current and progressive ideas of the \"new feminism\", two very different sisters will try to feel like a single whole in a project that aims to help other girls accept themselves. But will it help the siblings to accept each other?",
