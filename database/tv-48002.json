  "overview": "When living space becomes unlivable, the answer to your pleas for help may come from the unlikely source of your overgrown and underused backyard. Looking to provide salvation from cramped households in Season 3 of Backyard Builds, are contractor Brian McCourt and design expert Sarah Keenleyside. Armed with the homeowner's needs and budget, families are left speechless as they see their backyard wasteland turned into a dreamland, with breath-taking custom builds. Whether it's a life-sized playhouse set back in the trees, a stained glass studio, or a wellness wonderland, extending your living space has never looked so good.",
