  "overview": "Ella has no husband, no children and no private life, but runs the best maternity ward in the Netherlands. It seems to be enough for her, because Ella loves her job dearly. Despite loving it so dearly, it also causes lots of stress and problems for her and her colleagues as she has to make long working days in a tough and challenging working environment, which is also highly understaffed.Together with her colleagues, she guides them with the most challenging births, where pain and ecstasy go hand in hand and moments of happiness and sadness can alternate within a matter of seconds. Like it is nothing, but it is not nothing. It's a matter about a new life.",
