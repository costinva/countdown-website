  "overview": "She's Got the Look follows 20 women -- all over the age of 35 -- vying for a modeling contract. Selected by TV Land and Wilhelmina's Model Search team after months of auditions and regional competitions around the country, the contenders have been flown to New York to live in a house together to see who has what it takes to be the next great supermodel. Through a series of competitions such as photo shoots and tests on their fashion know-how, women will be eliminated weekly until the ultimate winner is crowned.",
