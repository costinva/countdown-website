  "overview": "Within a network of backroads that sprawl across Western Canada, Barriere, B.C. is ground zero for \"hotshotting\" – moving time sensitive loads as quickly as possible – which brings about a special breed of independent truckers who will haul anything, anywhere, at any time. Big Donny Kleinfelder is the king and he commands a ragtag crew of drivers who are rough around the edges, but experts at navigating treacherous backroads to reach remote businesses that urgently need their cargo. But Big Donny's empire is under threat from Dave Schwandt, a scrappy local salvage dealer who's decided to cut himself a piece of Donny's pie and get into the \"hotshotting\" game for himself. These two family businesses are heading into a battle royale over who will dominate the backroads, but only one is likely to come out still standing.",
