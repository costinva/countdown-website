  "overview": "Socially awkward Aharen-san has personal boundary issues, either getting too close or too far from her classmates. When fellow student Raido picks up an eraser she drops, Aharen-san decides they're now best friends. Whether studying, playing the arcade, or just eating lunchâ€”she's along for the ride. What follows is an impromptu bonding that shows affection can blossom in the unlikeliest of places!",
