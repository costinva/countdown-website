This reemerging city is all about family, friendship, business, excellence and of course, love and marriage. Love &amp; Marriage: Detroit will center on a group of African American families with deep ties to Detroit who have decided to stay in the city and prove they can provide the best lives possible for their families in this community on a comeback. ",
