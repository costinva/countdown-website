  "overview": "First &amp; Last puts contestants through a succession of ingenious rounds, all of which have one golden rule - players mustn't come first or last in any game. If they do, they will be eliminated. Eleven players start each show and compete across a range of downright daft, stupidly funny, play-along-at-home games that will see one of them leave with a cash prize of up to Â£10,000. To win, they'll need to judge every round to perfection and hold their nerve in the nail-biting endgame.",
