  "overview": "5-year-old Flo does not think of Ebb as a dog, and Ebb doesn't think of Flo as a child, they're simply best friends. Life revolves around their home, a boat moored near the mouth of a sea estuary, the boatyard and the little dinghy in which they visit Flo's Granny. She lives up a nearby creek and at her house in the wilderness, time seems to stand still.",
