  "overview": "Presented by Dr Shalin Naik, The Great Acceleration is a remarkable new science series where the ABC delves into its extensive archive to bring audiences the story of one of the most dramatic chapters of human history.The Great Acceleration is a term coined by scientists, in an effort to describe the most rapid period of change in human and planetary history. In the last fifty years humankind has achieved astounding heights of discovery and exploration while reaching a pace of consumption that threatens the very fabric of our existence.Across six one-hour episodes, the series examines major advances in the fields of space exploration, computing, energy, resources, Earth science and our understanding of the evolution of life itself. With expert commentary from scientists at the top of their field, such as geneticist Craig Venter and Nobel Prize winner Barry Barish, we hear firsthand accounts about some of the biggest moments in science, like the discovery of dark energy and gravitational waves, the creation of a new synthetic species and innovative solutions that may save the future of human civilisation.",
