She had once dreamed of opening a French-style patisserie and living a long, happy life with her husband. But those dreams are now in tatters. She has had to shelve her dreams of opening her own shop, after a death in the family, followed by financial difficulties. She takes a job at a dessert store named Les Années Lentes.And it is here that she encounters Xia Tian Yu, the third-generation heir of the Yucheng business group. His family wants him to become the group's CEO, but Xia Tian Yu has no intention of doing so.

Eventually, he begins to develop feelings for Zhou Xin Xing. And the duo resolves to enter a prestigious dessert-making contest. But love rivals are not far away, with long-term admirers of both Zhou Xin Xing and Xia Tian Yu ready to make their moves! Will this unlikely duo find love – or will societal pressures take their toll? ",
