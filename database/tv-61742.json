  "overview": "Menudo: Forever Young chronicles the rise and fall of the most iconic Latin American boy band in history, bringing viewers into the world of  the popular teen idols' global tours, magazine covers, ‘80s outfits, and screaming fangirls. But the four-part documentary reveals that behind the glitz and glamour was a web of abuse and exploitation at the hands of the band's manager, Edgardo Diaz. Through revealing interviews with former Menudo members, the film examines how this extravagant facade was disguising serious wrongdoings by Diaz. ",
