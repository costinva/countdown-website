  "overview": "Rhoda is an extremely sexy young woman living with womanizing Air Force shrink Bob McDonald. What Bob knows and the rest of the world does not is that Rhoda's real name is AF 709, and she is actually a sophisticated (yet naive) robot. Bob's job is to teach Rhoda how to be a \"perfect\" woman, and keep her identity secret from the world -- especially lecherous neighbor Peter.",
