  "overview": "With a career that spans from founding the R&amp;B super group New Edition to a successful solo run, Bobby Brown's life truly epitomizes the meaning of sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll. Hailed as the King of R&amp;B, Bobby Brown is undisputedly one of the genre's original \"bad boys.\" His hits may have kept him at the top of the charts, but his antics kept him on the front page and The Bobby Brown Story will cover it all.",
