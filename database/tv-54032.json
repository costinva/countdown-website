  "overview": "Young police officers are left out in Cologne-M端hlheim. Commissioner Hui Ko ( Aaron Le ) holds the position with the ambitious head of department Vicky Adam ( Katja Danowski ), but otherwise there is far and wide no one in sight who wants to do the job. When a body is digged into a carnival uniform in the city forest, which has DM 50,000 in the lapel, police chief Plocher ( Michael Prelle ) comes up with the idea, to bring back the two commissioners Edwin Bremer ( Tilo Pr端ckner ) and G端nter Hoffmann ( Wolfgang Winkler ), who worked on the case 18 years ago. The change is just right for the two reactivated commissioners, who can already look back on 40 years of service. While G端nther is now kept busy as a full-time grandpa by his grandchildren,Edwin mourns his late wife and is immersed in self-pity and neglect.",
