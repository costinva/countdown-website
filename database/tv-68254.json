  "overview": "A story about two forensic scientists and the cases they work on. The two team up to solve murder cases and provide answers that the police cannot find. Gu Chu had to finish school later due to family issues. During her internship, she meets Lu Bei Chen, Chief of Forensics. Lu Bei Chen is actually the older twin of Gu Chu's last boyfriend, though he has passed on. The two share a weird connection as Bei Chen still has unresolved feelings over his brother's death that he carries over Gu Chu. The two start to fall for each but there are many misunderstandings between the two families and they face many roadblocks.",
