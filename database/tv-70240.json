  "overview": "Norfolk and Suffolk: Country &amp; Coast discovers the counties known as the breadbasket of Britain, exploring the famous wild coastlines, deep and green forests and rich heritage dating back over hundreds of years. The series journeys deep into Norfolk &amp; Suffolk to meet the locals living under counties' big sky and working across the region's diverse industries. From the people harvesting the rich arable farmland to traditional town traders and the individuals catering from an influx of sun-worshipping tourists, we hear their eclectic stories of life in the East of England, set against the stunning landscape of some of the nation's best beaches to the historic architectural background of windmills and ancient Roman forts.",
