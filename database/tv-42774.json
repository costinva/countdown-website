  "overview": "In the near future, the evolution of the internet has given way to a world in crisis; one where everyone's connected but no one is safe. Molly Solis, a cyber analyst, understood these dangers better than anyone and was determined to make a difference… until she disappeared. Now, friends and foes from her past are in a race against time to decipher cryptic messages she's left behind; tales that paint a grim picture of technology run amok. As the mystery deepens, they'll discover the stories, and Molly herself, may be concealing information that could change the world… or destroy it.",
