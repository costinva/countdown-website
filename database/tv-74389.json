  "overview": "Michel Roux navigates the magnificent Thames River from his family restaurant in Bray to the Thames Estuary where the river meets the North Sea. He'll be stopping at places along its banks, to enjoy its food, its chefs, its local characters and history - using them all to inspire the very best of his own cooking.Just as the Thames evolves from rural Idyll to urban thorough-fare, the food served up alongside Britain's most historic waterway evolves along its journey towards the North Sea. From Michelin starred grandeur to the traditional fare of London's East End, via some of the most exciting young chefs, shops and markets around.Back on the boat, Michel will cook up glorious dishes inspired by what he's encountered along the way; from a luxurious lobster ravioli and a smoked duck burger to a classic lemon tart and heartfelt apple crumble.",
