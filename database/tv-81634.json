After inviting Kotoha to her home, Megumi hopes to become friends with her. However, Kotoha proposes an unusual arrangement: they will act as \"lovers\" until Megumi can guess her real name. The two make a peculiar betâ€”if Megumi succeeds in guessing Kotoha's name during their temporary relationship, they will become friends as originally intended. Unable to back out, Megumi grows closer to Kotoha as they play the roles of lovers. However, the hidden past tied to Kotoha's name begins to surface, threatening their bond.",
