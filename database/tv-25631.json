  "overview": "In Beachin' RV's, follow husband and wife team Justin and Anna Scribner as they crisscross the country seeking out vintage RVs to transform into beach bungalows on wheels. They'll search through trailer graveyards to find a hidden gem that has been put out to RV pasture, then haul it back to their shop in Bend, Oregon to give it a full overall ready to soak up the sun and fun! We'll follow buyers as they pick up their new RVs and bring them to the beach and stake their claim on an affordable piece of waterfront paradise.",
