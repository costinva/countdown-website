  "overview": "Thousands of great American cars are slowly rotting away in hidden places across the country. Most of these vehicles are long forgotten relics that are destined never to drive down another road. Derek Bieri of the popular Vice Grip Garage YouTube channel wants to change that. He has a deep seeded belief that all these vehicles should get a second chance. Follow Derek as he seeks out abandoned cars from America's past and gets them running and back on the road where they belong.",
