  "overview": "30 Tage Lust follows high school sweethearts Freddy and Zeno, both about to turn thirty. A daring experiment puts a long-term relationship to the test: Freddy and Zeno agree to 30 days of sex with whomever they want. Throughout the experiment, awkward dates and bizarre encounters create suspicion between them, while moments of tenderness emerge amidst the emotional rollercoaster. As day 30 + 1 approaches, the question remains: Has the experiment brought them closer, or has it been too much to ask? The melancomedy offers a highly relatable exploration of navigating life when you're almost thirty and the journey of self-discovery still proves elusive.",
