  "overview": "El estado contra Pablo Ibar is a detailed account of the court case of more than 25 years that led to Pablo Ibar being sentenced to death for a triple homicide in Miramar, Florida. The murders were the first in U.S. history to be fully recorded on a home security camera, making the case one of the most talked about in Florida history. Pablo Ibar's case was reopened in 2016, after the Florida Supreme Court ruled that there was a lack of evidence against him.",
