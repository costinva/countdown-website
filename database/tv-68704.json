  "overview": "Long ago, dinosaurs lived on our planet. One day, the Earth collided with a huge meteorite, and in order to survive, the dinosaurs went into underground caves. Under the ground, they rapidly evolved and learned to turn into various machines and mechanisms. This is how the civilization of turbosaurs arose. They knew that humanity was developing on the surface of the Earth, but they kept their existence a strict secret... Exactly until the day when the meeting of the turbosaurus and man took place. This is a great adventure of dinosaurs and children who form a rescue team and solve various interesting tasks together: help friends and neighbors, save animals, protect the environment.",
