  "overview": "Let Us Prey: A Ministry of Scandals a new four-part docuseries exposing the predatory and insidious behavior within Independent Fundamental Baptist (IFB) Churches, and the struggles of survivors to find justice. Featuring first-hand accounts from survivors, church defectors and activists, Let Us Prey offers crucial insight into the troubling culture within the IFB and the stronghold the churches have on its members.Â Since its inception in the 1950s, the IFB has evolved into one of the dominant religious forces in the United States today with an estimated 8 million believers spread out over 6,000 churches across the country. Let Us Prey uncovers the dark innerworkings behind the IFB's cheery and virtuous exterior by exposing depraved secrets and violence that have existed within their churches for decades. Rituals oriented towards \"breaking a child's will,\" mind control and torture are only the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface lurks accusations of rape and physical abuse of members, including minors, at the hands of IFB figure heads.",
