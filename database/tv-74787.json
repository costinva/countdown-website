  "overview": "Kostya goes to school, does sports he doesn't like, and doesn't know how to communicate with girls at all. He also worries that he's still a virgin, unlike his friends. When his parents go on vacation, the guy throws a party at his place in the hope that Katya, his most beautiful classmate, will reciprocate his feelings. Forbidden parties, alcohol and classmates — it would seem that what could go wrong? It is from this moment that Kostya begins an amazing and dramatic chase for the \"first time\", which will show him what it really means to be an adult.",
