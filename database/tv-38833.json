  "overview": "Gert and James will moor again this autumn in Antwerp, in the beautiful shadow of the Mas. On board the Evanna they receive three famous guests every week and together with them they make a daily talk show where everything is allowed and everything is possible. In the same boat, sleeping, eating, laughing and talking, this season will undoubtedly lead to surprising encounters, personal revelations and an original look at current affairs.",
