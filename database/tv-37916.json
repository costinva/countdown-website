  "overview": "Byron, Christie, Eileen and Dexter are friends on the campus of Kent State University at the time of the Kent State murders. As they graduate and go their separate ways, they face the issues and challenges of the 1970's including three presidencies, the Watergate scandal, the end of the Vietnam War, the rise of the women's movement and a surreal mass suicide. The 70's combines historic news footage with top-notch production and factual history with the story of four friends learning learning about life, love, and of course, disco.",
