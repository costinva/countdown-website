  "overview": "A popular BL manga was set to be adapted into a live-action drama. The two lead roles were played by Hajime Aoyanagi, a talented actor who used to be a successful child actor but who was not so popular anymore, and Yuichiro Akafuji, who was a popular and handsome actor. Aoyagi had a hard time with Akafuji's casual attitude, but Akafuji, on the other hand, seemed to be seriously in love with Aoyagi. Will the two stars successfully act out their BL drama?Â ",
