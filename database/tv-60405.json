  "overview": "The alien superhero Marvelous Man has kept the earth at peace for 40 years. But when a devastating secret and its tragic consequences throws our world into chaos, it's up to Marvelous Man's bitter, violent lieutenant Knight Hawk and idealistic do-gooder The Speed to stop nuclear war. An art house satire of the superhero genre, Guardians of Justice mixes live action with traditional animation, claymation, cut out paper animation, and 8-bit video game footage in a kaleidoscope of pop art insanity.",
