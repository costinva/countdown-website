  "overview": "Each installment of Travel Channel's Shock Docs goes to the heart of a true American horror story – and a peek into history. We travel across the country to uncover the best-documented paranormal encounters – tales recorded on video and audio that capture the raw terror of an encounter with evil. Additional Shock Docs on the slate for later this fall will delve into the true-life hauntings of the Amityville Horror House and The Exorcism of Roland Doe.",
