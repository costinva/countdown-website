These days singletons think nothing of arranging to meet a stranger for a date or opening doors to someone they have purchased something from online.But in the last year, the number of serious crimes linked to dating apps has increased by over 10 times, and the police believe that it's one of the biggest threats facing the public. To make it worse, there's not a lot the police can do in a world where daters invite strangers into their lives with no idea about who they really are. A staggering 10 per cent of all known sex offenders use online dating apps as their very own private hunting ground.With access to the victims' families and the police, Swipe Right for Murder is a very modern true crime series for very modern times.",
