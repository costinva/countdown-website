  "overview": "All over the globe, catastrophic wildfires are threatening the climate and our future. This documentary travels the globe to follow the work of a dedicated community of fire experts as they light experimental fires in laboratories, study the history of our forests, and scrutinize the escalating range and impact of the blazes, from hidden smoldering fires deep inside the soil to smoke clouds reaching into the stratosphere. The rediscovery of ancient fire prevention methods as well as large-scale fire experiments pave the way towards possible solutions. How can we learn to live safely with fire in the future?",
