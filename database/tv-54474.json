  "overview": "Street Justice follows a hot-headed police detective who detests criminals, but doesn't have the patience to wait for them make 'illegal mistakes' before taking the law into his own hands. He works to clean up the streets, and if he has to cut some corners to get his man behind bars, he'll do it without thinking twice. What happens when the hunter becomes the hunted, and when justice becomes a relative term.",
