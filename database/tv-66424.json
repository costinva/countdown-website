  "overview": "When normal police work gets stuck, their work begins. The team of \"R.I.S.\" uses the most modern scientific methods to solve murders. They are the best of the best in their field, they understand the language of the dead. And you are the last chance for justice. Criminal prosecution has changed: ever better instruments and methods are available for securing evidence. With technology at the forefront, investigators must hone skills across a wide range of disciplines to make their manhunts, bring down perpetrators of violent crime, and bring justice. For this reason, the Forensic Investigative Special Commission, abbreviated RIS, was founded in Berlin. In it, scientists and police officers go together in search of clues and perpetrators.",
