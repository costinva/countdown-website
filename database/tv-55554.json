  "overview": "Dan Sun and his family are a new kind of Chinese immigrant to Canada – rich, confident and aggressive. Dan has made a fortune in China but now he wants to protect his money and his family from the political corruption back home. Rachel, his wife, tries to navigate their ascension into the upper echelons of Canadian society. Son Sammy does his best to run away from all family obligations while daughter Nicole tries to impress on her father that she really makes a better son than Sammy. But Dan must balance the needs of his family against the constant expectations of the government back in China. Like his family, they always want something more from him.",
