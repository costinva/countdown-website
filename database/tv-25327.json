  "overview": "Since there are millions of dollars to be made by becoming an NBA player, parents are getting their children involved in the sport at increasingly younger ages, hoping they can gain the skills necessary to make it to the big time. This series follows several Chicago-area women who are entrepreneurs and mothers of young basketball stars. The feisty ladies do whatever it takes to make sure their businesses succeed, and they have the same mindset with their hoop prodigies. It's not easy to balance their businesses with their family lives and basketball, but the women are determined to make sure it all works out -- even if it means fighting with the other moms to ensure that their own kids reach the top of the ladder.",
