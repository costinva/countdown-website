  "overview": "At the outset of the Yalta Conference on February 4, 1945, the \"Big Three\" were all optimistic: the accord that they had achieved seemed likely to hold strong. However, nothing would remain of this agreement apart from irreconcilable differences. Combining archive footage, photographs, original letters and unique testimonies, these two episodes revisit this crucial period in History.",
