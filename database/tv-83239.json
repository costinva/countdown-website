  "overview": "Vizinhos para Sempre portrays the lives of the residents of Terra√ßos do Glamour, a recent and poorly built condominium. The series explores tense and fun relationships, between connections, such as absurd disputes, impossible loves and unexpected alliances; and has as its backdrop the housing crisis and typical neighborhood conflicts. All this with an irreverent and current humor.",
