  "overview": "At the center of the series is the failed public prosecutor Eduardo (Jürgen Tarrach), who now has to work with his idiosyncratic methods as a public defender. However, he does not even do this from a law firm, but in a run-down hotel, where he also lives. Nobody knows exactly why Eduardo ended up here, including his new assistant Marcia (Vidina Popov). Marcia has a first-class degree in law, but as a Roma she faces closed doors on the job market.",
