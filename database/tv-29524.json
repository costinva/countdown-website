  "overview": "How many times have you been cooking in the kitchen and shamelessly wished you had a camera there to catch you every culinary move? Well if you've got your hand up in agreement, fear not because you're not alone. Come Dine with Me has been bringing those exact moments into our homes from the UK for years. Now thankfully the most public dinner party on television has finally landed on our fair isle. Expect a lot of wine, singing and just pray nobody whips out the corned beef.",
