  "overview": "Fantasy Ireland is an outrageous post-watershed animated comedy series set in a fantastical version of contemporary Ireland (mixed with a dollop of Irish mythology). We follow three flatmates living in Rathmines who are flung together to form The Shamz â€“ the new unwitting saviours of Ireland sent to save us from ourselves and more importantly a greedy priest hell-bent on setting us back fifty years!",
