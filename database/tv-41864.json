  "overview": "Paradise Hotel follows a group of singles who are given the opportunity of a lifetime--to check in to an exclusive tropical resort â€“ and check out with big money. Immersed in a gorgeous setting, these strangers will be surrounded by sun, fun and romance--all cloaked in a wild competition. This paradise won't last forever...it will take strategy to remain there. Each week, these singles will vote off one of their fellow residents to make room for a new guest. In a new twist, viewers can play along at home, using social media to try and influence what happens on screen, including helping to decide who stays and who goes.",
