  "overview": "Dart Kings takes viewers on a nostalgic trip down memory lane through the golden age of darts and shines a spotlight on the nation's most unlikely sporting heroes: Eric Bristow, Jocky Wilson and Phil Taylor.In 1972, darts staggered out of the pub and onto British primetime television, bringing with it a cast of – by today's standards - unlikely sporting heroes. Today, discipline is key to sporting success but in those first moments when the game hit the bigtime, the greatest players mixed extraordinary skill at the oche with boozing, chain-smoking, and an open-door policy to fans and the media alike.Yet it was this combination of skill and raw, unfiltered personality that brought in television audiences of over 10 million and created some of the most memorable characters in sporting history.Against a backdrop of rising unemployment and unrest in 1980s Britain, darts brought entertainment and energy to British audiences. Join us as we explore the incredible journeys of three of the greatest names in darts, charting their rise, rivalries, heartache, and triumphs through the 1970s, ‘80s and '90s.",
