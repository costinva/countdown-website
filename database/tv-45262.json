  "overview": "This is the story about the son of one of the greatest tyrants of the twentieth century—Joseph Stalin's flesh and blood, Vasily. Lieutenant General at 26, a womanizer and a boozehound, Vasily Stalin has always lived a life too scandalous for the Soviet Union and yet too insignificant to ever escape the shadow of his larger-than-life father. The dictator's sudden death will sober Vasily up just to place even more hardships and trials on his shoulders.",
