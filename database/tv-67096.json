  "overview": "One Night is the story of three women whose bond was all but destroyed by the traumatic events of one night 20 years ago.Since then, Simone has harboured secret hopes of becoming a novelist but most of her haphazard attempts have been shoved into her bottom drawer. Now, at the age of 40, she has finally written the one story she could never get out of her mind, and her debut manuscript has become an unexpected overnight success.As it becomes harder to prise fact from fiction, one person's memory and story from another's, the book threatens to derail all their friendships, bringing old traumas to the surface of the small coastal community where they grew up, and stirring its perpetrators, who want to make it all go away.",
