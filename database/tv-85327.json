  "overview": "10 experienced outdoor enthusiasts aged 21 to 62 are sent on a unique adventure – isolated in the Norwegian wilderness. Equipped only with a camera and simple fishing gear, each one is left to their own devices. The participants have no idea where they are going. Each one is transported to their own area around Altevatn, which is located 480 meters above sea level at the tree line in Troms county. Here they will set up camp, get enough food and cope with the loneliness. The participants film everything themselves and it is their comments and experiences that drive the story. When they can't take it anymore – they can ask to be taken home. ",
