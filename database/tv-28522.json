  "overview": "Shaun Micallef set out to prove that variety isn't dead, with the return of a traditional Tonight Show moulded with his own brand of subtle humour and non-traditional celebrity guest interviews and musical acts. The hilarious and almost parody show had a guest list featuring not only the cream of the Australian entertainment industry, but the yoghurt and the cheese as well!!",
