  "overview": "Because of a sudden kindness, Liang Xi has ten thousand years of true power, and joins Tianlingmen to embark on the official path of self-cultivation. Turning your hands into clouds and covering your hands into rain, while talking and laughing, the powerful enemies are wiped out. My wish is very simple. It is nothing more than planting flowers and raising grass, and making bubble girls and refining treasures. Covering the world with one hand, very good and powerful. Liang Xi looked at the sentient beings in the seven realms crawling under his feet, and emphasized that I am a man with a strong sense of chastity.",
