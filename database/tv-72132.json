  "overview": "Modern-day office drone Zou Yan accidentally stumbles into the world of cultivation and wakes up as Liao Tingyan, a disciple of the Qinggutian Sect. She's soon selected to serve the reclusive Grandmaster Sima Jiao, a powerful cultivator who's been secretly sealed inside a mountain for 500 years. Twisted by isolation and rage, he's cold, hot-tempered, and bent on revenge. Liao Tingyan doesn't konw that \"her\" original identity is a demonic assassin. But to his surprise, she shows no ill will, no ambition, and no desire at all. Her nature fascinates him. Thus begins an unlikely romance between a villainous immortal and a healing-type \"slacker,\" a connection that defies fate and spans lifetimes.",
