  "overview": "On New Year's Eve, in a tiny, cozy hotel in the Carpathians, fate, not without the help of the hotel owner Ivan, brings together very different people. Valera, a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, goes from the front line to the border to dissuade his wife from getting a divorce. Volunteer Tanya is unsuccessfully trying to raise money for a batch of drones and rushes to customs. Blogger Lisa just wants to live her cloudless and cheerful pre-war life. Deputy Petrovych dreams of escaping abroad with a suitcase of money. They all have very different dreams and views on life, but they will all meet the New Year together to understand what they really expect from the future.",
