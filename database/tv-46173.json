  "overview": "Based on a true story. 18-year-old Laetitia is missing. Her scooter was found on its side just in front of the house in the early hours. When the gendarmes look into the affair they very quickly piece together the young woman's final hours. The investigators arrest the perpetrator but while they are sure of Tony Meilhon's guilt they cannot find the body. Because of this distressing state of affairs we examine both the consequences for Laëtitia's family - above all her twin sister Jessica - and also the action taken by the authorities: on the one hand a meticulous search for the truth conducted by the investigating judge and the Nantes public prosecutor on the other the President of the French Republic of the day Nicolas Sarkozy who accuses the officials of laxity and does his best to whip up public indignation in the hope of gaining political benefits.",
