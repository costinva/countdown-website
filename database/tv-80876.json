  "overview": "The story speaks of a love that transcends a millennium. The female protagonist, Qin Siyuan, is a shopkeeper who has lived for a thousand years, guarding a small store named Wuwang Pavilion. By day, she welcomes customers and lights up lanterns; by night, she lights lamps to guide the spirits of those on the brink of death. Each lamp she ignites fulfills someone's final wish. However, she cannot fulfill her death wish. Burdened by immense guilt, she is trapped outside the cycle of reincarnation, condemned to an immortal existence. When Shen Zheng accidentally stumbles into the Wuwang Pavilion, a peculiar phenomenon occurs with the Wuwang Lamp. Qin Siyuan realizes that her millennia-long wait has finally led her to the one destined to extinguish her lamp. At the same time, she discovers that Shen Zheng is fated to die before turning twenty and persuades him to stay in the shop to extend his life. \"I'll extend your life, and you'll extinguish my lamp.\" At first glance, it seems like a great deal for Shen Zheng. However, Shen Zheng's rebellious nature clashes with Qin Siyuan's forceful and often violent attempts to control him. The two engage in relentless pursuit and resistance until Shen Zheng eventually yields, becoming her reluctant servant. Together, they embark on a journey to locate the elusive Lamp Extinguishing Cover hidden in the bustling city of Haidu. Amid perilous adventures, their bickering gradually turns into mutual affection.",
