  "overview": "Prof. Robert Michelson takes you on a journey to a time when the Watchers roamed the Earth, corrupting it for their own pleasure and as an affront to its creator. So massive was this premeditated interference in God's created order, that the Almighty used His creation to obliterate the monstrous works of corruption as well as the hands that created them. Learn why God would bring a great flood upon his world, and how such a flood of global impact might have been accomplished by God using only the forces of His own creation. See the physical evidence of the Great Flood and how it was recorded in eyewitness accounts. See the likely landing place of the Ark of Noah in the mountains of Urartu along the border between Turkey and Iran based not only on the ancient accounts of eyewitnesses, but on the physical evidence (actual artifacts) existing today. Finally, learn how ancient Egypt played a central role in the events just prior to, and immediately after the Great Flood. Follow Prof. Robert Michelson as he searches the region for artifacts pertaining to the account of the Great Flood and see antediluvian structures unearthed for the first time after the flood waters covered them with silt thousands of years ago.",
