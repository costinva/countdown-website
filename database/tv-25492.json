  "overview": "Meet Jeff Wulkan, a 28-year old airline pilot with dreams of becoming the \"Hugh Hefner of Hair\". Jeff struggles to keep his boardwalk barbershop afloat in Long Branch, NJ after hiring five, hard partying, bikini clad, 20-something divas, armed with scissors and tons of baggage. Without a hair of experience, Jeff is caught in the middle of the hookups, fights and insanity at his new salon on the Jersey shore.",
