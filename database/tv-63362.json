Decades of interviews, highlights, mic'd up sound and never before seen off-the-field moments are placed into context by the Icon's own words and narrator Rich Eisen. This is a football storytelling series 60 years in the making, providing a collection of record-breaking accomplishments, emotional journeys and singular legacies. ",
