  "overview": "Ever since their brutal murders 100 years ago, the world has been fascinated by Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, the Empress Alexandra. Through the couple's politically damning, sexually intimate and personally revealing letters, this brand new two-part docudrama, presented by acclaimed historian and broadcaster Dr Suzannah Lipscomb, explores Nicholas and Alexandra's complex love story and the couple's role in the lead up to the Russian Revolution of 1917, which led to their eventual brutal and tragic executions.",
