  "overview": "The Rez is a comedy/drama that focuses upon a group of young characters living on the Kidabanesee Reserve in Ontario, created by W.P. Kinsella for his short story collection/movie \"Dance Me Outside\". Among the youths are the awkward Silas Crow, who dreams of becoming a writer; his girlfriend Sadie, a fiery young woman who takes up native issues with admirable commitment; Silas' party-loving best friend Frank, who when not playing table hockey at the local bar is thinking of pick-up lines to use on the women of the reserve; and Lucy, Frank's on-again-off-again girlfriend, whose goal is to become a singer on Broadway.Â ",
