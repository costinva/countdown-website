  "overview": "A spectacular aerial journey up Scotland's western coastline. The edge of the land is where geography becomes history, much of what defines the Scots happened where the mountains tumble into the sea, where the Atlantic's long fingers reach into the heart of Scotland. From the air we see where man has patterned the landscape; the great city of Glasgow, the fisher towns of the west. We see the marks made by a thousand generations; the stones of Callanish, the brochs of Glenelg. The wild margins of Scotland have been shaped by the raw power of the ocean; the cliffs at Cape Wrath, the jagged ridge of the Cuillin. This DVD features the first six programmes from the popular Scottish Television series. Programme 1: Starting in Glasgow, down the Clyde to Arran, the Mull of Kintyre, the Isle of Gigha, throught the Crinan Canal to Inverary Castle. Programme 2: The stunning seascape of the Inner Hebrides: Islay and Jura, Oronsay, Colonsay and Mull, Tiree and Coll, Muck, Eigg, Rhum and Conna.
