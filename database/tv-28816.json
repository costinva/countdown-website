  "overview": "Roadkill Garage is an all-new show that will be appearing exclusively on Motor Trend On Demand monthly in 2016. Featuring David Freiburger from Roadkill and Steve Dulcich from Engine Masters (don't worry, Mike Finnegan is still the co-host on Roadkill), Roadkill Garage finds Freiburger and Dulcich wrenching on Roadkill project cars and other things that meet the Roadkill vibe. They'll show you how to do the wrong things the right way.",
