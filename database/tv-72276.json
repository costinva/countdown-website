  "overview": "Once upon a time there were seven of them - a magnificent seven of friends who were the envy of the whole school. Among them was the smartest guy and the most beautiful girl, and the rest showed great promise. It all ended in disaster: one of them was accused of murdering a teacher. The rest went their own way through life. Lera became a police profiler, successfully caught murderers and tried not to remember the past. But her career failed - and she decided to go on vacation to the city of her childhood. Quite by chance, her arrival coincided with the day of the alumni meeting. Six friends who haven't seen each other for many years decide to watch an old video - and soon they realize that not everything is so clear with the tragedy that separated them many years ago.",
