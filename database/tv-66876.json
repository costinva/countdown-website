  "overview": "In the early 80's of the 20th century, Wang Xue Hua, Dong Fang Hong and Yang Si Yu are all born on the same day. With the birth of the children, emotional entanglement of three families and two generations unfolded little by little. But soon, this peaceful families coexistence ends abruptly. The feud between the Wang's family and the Yang's family's fathers starts involving their beloved ones, and causes the two people who loved each other to separate. Unable to look at the crumbling, long-term ties, the youngest generation decides to do everything to reconcile the feuding parties.",
