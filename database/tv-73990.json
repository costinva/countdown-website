  "overview": "High Road, Low Road is a fun, travel show which pairs top celebrities and sends them off to popular holiday destinations, city break favourites and far flung places for an unforgettable adventure of discovery, culture and fun!However…Both are headed to the same location, but they'll have very different experiences.For one holidaymaker, it's first class travel, luxury hotels and the finest cuisine. Five-star all the way. For their companion, it's economy travel, budget digs and local street food.So as one is driven off in a limo to their luxurious five-star hotel, the other sets off to find the shuttle bus to their hostel. They will meet up several times on the trip to compare notes, and gloat.But at the end it's interesting to hear them talk and decide who has had the better time…",
