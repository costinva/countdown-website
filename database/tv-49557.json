  "overview": "A joint project of START, Nonfiction.flim and the \"Amurskie volni\" studios. The hosts-actor Vladimir Mishukov and journalist Nastya Krasilnikova-will discuss the stories of women who have experienced violence in different situations: at work, in the hospital, at home. Frank stories and figures will become an occasion for a conversation in which a man and a woman can hear each other and say what they were previously silent about.   ",
