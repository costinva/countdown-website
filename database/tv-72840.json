  "overview": "The city of Kalyazin is small, picturesque, in general, like many such cities. Nothing unusual, except for a secret institute dedicated to... the study of magic. One day, the most powerful sorceress, the Mistress of the Elements, escapes from the laboratory. Driven by hatred and the desire to take revenge for her imprisonment, she cuts off the city from the outside world and begins to turn the city's inhabitants into goblins and mermaids, striving for one thing - to cleanse the real world of people and fill it with fairy-tale creatures. Alexey Popov decides to defeat the Mistress of the Elements in order to save his loved ones and free the city. Together with him, blacksmith Nikita Dobrynin and programmer Ilya Muromtsev enter the fight against evil. However, the Mistress of the Elements puts up serious resistance - a serious struggle for family, love and the right to remain human is unfolding in Kalyazin.",
