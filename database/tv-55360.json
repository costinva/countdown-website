  "overview": "The journalist and doctor asks five volunteers to put their lives in his hands as he attempts to turn their health around in just 21 days. Initial testing reveals all of them to likely be at risk from debilitating conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, chronic inflammation and stress.
