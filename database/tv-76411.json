  "overview": "\"Reboot\" is a show of incredible transformations. The participants in the project are ordinary girls who find themselves in a difficult situation. They have different stories, but they all have one thing in common: \"Reboot\" is the first step towards a new happy life. The main goal of the show is not only external transformation, but also internal transformation, behind which lies the painstaking work of specialists. Presenter Ksenia Borodina and her team will prove to the project participants that they deserve the best. Psychologists, fitness trainers, plastic surgeons, stylists, cosmetologists and makeup artists work with the girls for a whole month.",
