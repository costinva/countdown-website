  "overview": "Elite hockey coach Luboš Hrouzek, an Olympic champion from Nagano and a former NHL player, is about to divorce his wife Helena and, most importantly, is also parting ways with his club HC Slavia Prague. He decides to leave Prague and start anew in a place where probably no one would expect him... in Havířov! And he is definitely not going there alone. He wants to create a new hockey legend in Havířov, Hrouzek junior. Nobody will ever write the name Hrouzek on the jersey in Cyrillic alphabet as long as Luboš is alive. The name Hrouzek belongs on the NHL jersey!",
