  "overview": "There was a game house in the forest where the gamekeeper Robátko lived. He wore a green waistcoat and a cap with a grouse feather. He would come out of the game house early in the morning to see if everything was alright in the forest. There he met a pinwheel deer who helped him take care of the forest.",
