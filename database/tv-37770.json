  "overview": "From the streets to the boardroom, T.I. wrote the book on hustling and now he's looking for the nation's next big hustler to see who will come out on top. Set in the streets of Atlanta, these contestants use the city to prove they have what it takes to out-hustle the rest! In the end, T.I. will choose one person to be named King or Queen of the Hustle - landing a six-figure job working at one of T.I.'s companies.",
