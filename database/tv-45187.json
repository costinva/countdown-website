  "overview": "Why Are You Like This follows best friends Mia and Penny as they navigate their 20s in Melbourne, along with Penny's dramatic and aloof housemate, Austin. Guided by their own modern day moral code, they confront complex social issues in an outrage driven world, leaving a path of destruction in their wake. Why Are You Like This explores the grey areas a lot of us are afraid to traverse, in a world determined to see things as black and white.",
