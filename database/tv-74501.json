  "overview": "The show is a series about the sheer joy of making a noise with friends and reminds us that â€˜music is for everyone', as well as having themes of community, friendship, and cooperation at its heart. Yukee offers young audiences a gentle, child-centred introduction to music education and exposes them to simple, yet fundamental musical concepts that will form a strong foundation for lifelong learning and enjoyment of music - beat, rhythm, pitch, tempo, timbre, form, dynamics, expression and style.Yukee herself is of Northern Ireland and Chinese heritage - and in every episode takes her own beloved red ukulele into a magical garden filled with instrument playing animal friends. Music adventures are never far away, and song ideas can come from anywhere in the garden - be it the rhythmic pitter patter of raindrops, or a gang of passing ants stomping their tiny feet to a steady beat.",
