  "overview": "Universe's original entertainment Pirate Reboot: Five Treasures is a real world with 8 characters composed from ATEEZ's 8 members (Hongjoong, Seonghwa, Yunho, Yeosang, San, Mingi, Wooyoung, and Jongho) sailing through the huge sea of space. The first episode depicts the space pirate ATEEZ who received probation from the ESC for participating in the battle to clean up the bad guys. ATEEZ, who ran a 'Wonderland' guesthouse on Earth after confiscation of a pirate license, found a mysterious box while cleaning the room, raising curiosity about what will happen in the future. The Universe's original entertainment show, Pirate Reboot: Five Treasures, is expected to depict ATEEZ's sharp reasoning and flashing base in an interesting way. Global fans' attention is focusing on whether ATEEZ can successfully complete ESC's mission and recover its honor by finding a pirate license.",
