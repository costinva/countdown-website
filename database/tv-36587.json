  "overview": "Based on the hit Warner Bros. format of the same name, Back in Time for Dinner takes one Canadian family on a whirlwind trip back in time as they eat their way through six decades of Canadian life. Over the course of the series, the Campus family â€“ five food-loving, busy middle-class suburbanites - will surrender their modern diets and lifestyle to go back in time. Starting in the 1940s and landing in the 1990s, their home will become a virtual time machine as it is transformed into a new decade each week.",
