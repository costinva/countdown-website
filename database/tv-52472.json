  "overview": "The Clown and the Candyman takes viewers down the rabbit hole to a murky world of predators in the '70s. Centered around the evil of Gacy and Corll, the special offers a deep dive into their crimes, how they were discovered, and the race to identify their remaining nameless victims. The special also investigates their connections to John David Norman, the key operator of a nationwide pedophile ring, while never-before-heard tapes of Gacy offers viewers a glimpse into the disturbed man and his hideous actions.",
