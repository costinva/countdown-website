  "overview": "Den siste viking is a magnificent and highly expensive reality series where 18 Norwegians are sent a thousand years back in time to measure knowledge and strength. The one with the highest Viking percentage in the blood remains the winner. Host Trond Espen Seim leads the reality game in character, as a good - the one who speaks for the Gods. The participants do not know what they are going for, but quickly realize that this will be much tougher than expected.",
