  "overview": "Mancations follows comedians and real life best friends, Evan Mann and Gareth Reynolds, as they set out on the road to discover what makes the best Mancations - the ultimate guy weekend - a time to get away from the daily grind, cut loose and make a lot of noise. This series will take viewers to places as diverse as Mancation Nation in Ariz., where men fire automatic weapons; to Space Camp in Huntsville, Ala., where boyhood dreams become a reality through shuttle simulators and centrifuge training; to Virginia Beach for Seal Training, where Navy Seals give the boys a serious whooping as they test their mental and physical limits.",
