  "overview": "Det stora experimentet is designed as a Christmas calendar and is the first ever to be featured exclusively on a streaming service.Viaplay's first children's original series is high-level fictional series entertainment. As with pace, nerves and pulse appeals to the children's natural curiosity and desire to learn. The series educates, maintains and encourages children to increase their understanding of various fields such as chemistry, music, mathematics and many more through 24 different experiments.We will follow the two winners of the Nordic region's premier inventory competition for children. The prize includes a visit to a true inventor: Professor Primus. The professor is now a failed figure who has not had any success since winning the competition a long time ago. The professor therefore becomes mad at jealousy on the children's creativity and locks them in their lab.The big question is - will they come home to their families before Christmas? The only way out is to solve the difficult experiments of the professor. Every day, they must try to solve a new experiment; they are able to open a door that hopefully leads to freedom.The series is recorded at Tekniska Museet in Stockholm. All the experimentally excited children can be exhibited and let the exploration luster sprout from 26 December.",
