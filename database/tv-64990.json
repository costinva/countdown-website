  "overview": "A journey to the depths of the Black Sea yields the greatest series of ancient shipwrecks ever discovered. In 2015, an international team of scientists began a 3 year exploration of the Black Sea in search of evidence of the ancient empires that sailed their ships into unknown waters in pursuit of trade, treasure and conquest. This documentary captures a series of astonishing discoveries made; a treasure trove of shipwrecks uniquely preserved that date back two and a half thousand years to the Greek and Roman empires, culminating in maritime archaeology's greatest ever wreck. A fully intact Roman wreck, perfectly preserved in the anoxic waters of the Black Sea.",
