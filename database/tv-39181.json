  "overview": "Jump from the highest TV tower, dinner at the most expensive restaurant in the world, meeting with superstar Rihanna and other incredible adventures fell on the participants of the travel show \"Tourists\". In the new project, hundreds of the best excursions, hotels and restaurants will be immediately appreciated by three groups of typical Russian vacationers: \"ours from Krasnoyarsk\", \"oligarchs from St. Petersburg\" and \"party girls\". And what for some is the idea of a paradise vacation, for others it will seem like a nightmare in reality. Europe, Latin America, Asia - the most famous resorts from almost all over the world, which Madonna, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and other Hollywood stars have already tried, will get into the camera lenses. The project participants are people of completely different status, financial wealth and travel experience. And if a married couple from Krasnoyarsk prefers an all-inclusive vacation in Turkey, St. Petersburg aesthetes choose hotels that cost at least 60 thousand rubles per day, then Moscow party girls are ready to fly anywhere in order to collect hundreds of likes. ",
