  "overview": "While the music club of Friday College had no success in the past year, the budget has been cut and there's a possibility that the club may be dissolved. The only way to prevent that from happening is to start winning competitions. In order to achieve such thing, the president of the club decides that all members will travel up north to Khon Kaen's Friday Colleague to practise their musical skills intensively during their holidays. On their journey up north, they will meet new friends and feelings will return which brought them far five years ago.",
