  "overview": "It's winter in the Algarve and little is happening. But, in the shadows, a Real Estate Fund is buying the entire island of Faro to build a luxury resort there. However, an unexpected obstacle appears: ZÃ© Maria, an old fisherman, owner of a famous beach restaurant, refuses to sell, under the influence of his daughter, Ana Cristina, who, in the meantime, returns from Switzerland. And his example is followed by other inhabitants of the island.",
