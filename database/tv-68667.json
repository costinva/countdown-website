She is forced into becoming the bride of the Beast-Turning King, Kuimulang (played by Chen ZheYuan). Despite Qipa's repeated attempts to escape, her life is further disrupted by a man named Li Xiong. Kuimulang only appears during the day, and Li Xiong only appears at night. Unbeknownst to Qipa, she has stumbled upon a shocking secret of the Beast-Turning Tribe. As mischievous and lively as she is, Qipa gradually finds her way into the heart of the domineering Wolf King. How will the beauty and the \"beast\" fall in love? A journey filled with laughter, sweetness, and heart-wrenching moments is about to unfold.",
