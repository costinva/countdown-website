  "overview": "The web series, \"Showterview with Jessi,\" by SBS's digital studio, Mobidic, is nothing like other talk shows. It breaks the typical format of a talk show, with the host often taking the spotlight over the guest and going off script. The unique format is what has brought this show, which has featured guest stars like Emma Stone, Kang Daniel and HyunA, huge popularity on YouTube, with fans from all around the world.Â ",
