  "overview": "Harumichi Bouya is the new transfer student coming to Suzuran High School, nicknamed the \"School of Crows\" because of the jet-black school outfit &amp; the fact that all of the students are hated delinquents. Harumichi quickly becomes friends with Yasuo Yasuda, a small &amp; weak boy who is easily preyed upon by the large Akutsu. Though Harumichi has no interest in the existing gang wars in Suzuran to determine who can lead the school as a unified group, a feat that has never been done in the history of the school, he still gets involved when his beastly power in fighting attracts the attention of Hideto Bandou, who leads a division of a motorcycle gang called The Front of Armament.",
