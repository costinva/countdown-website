  "overview": "The three elves (\"nisser\") Hansi, Fritz, and GÃ¼nter have to save the dying \"Gammelnisse\", the only way being to rewind his magic music box. This leads to a hunt for the winding key far, far away in his old \"nissehule\". Close by, a wife and her husband live a normal life,oblivious to what is happening around them. Things get interesting when an ominous, strange man shows up at their door step late one night, looking for local elves.",
