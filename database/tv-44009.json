  "overview": "Invisible Heroes tells the heroic tale of young Finnish diplomats in Chile during 1973's infamous military coup. Finnish diplomats Tapani Brotherus and Ilkka Jaamala along with Tapani's wife Lysa Brotherus helped over 2000 left-wing Chileans escape the military junta's persecution. The Finns acted without official authorization while Swedish ambassador Harald Edelstam was the most visible defendant of human rights with the backing of Sweden's Prime Minister, Olof Palme. Finns were the invisible heroes.",
