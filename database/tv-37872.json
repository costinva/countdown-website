  "overview": "Ylvis møter veggen was a Norwegian gameshow with the Ylvis brothers. The concept was to avoid falling in a pool of cold water. The Ylvis brothers were team leaders for each team where the task was to make the body fit through special openings in an isopor wall that came against the participants at a certain speed. If one does not fit into the opening, the isopor wall would push the participants down into a pool of cold water. The teams stood in silver-gray solid dresses where one team had blue helmets and the other red. There were two celebrities on each team.",
