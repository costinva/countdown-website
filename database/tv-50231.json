  "overview": "Imma Tataranni is a deputy prosecutor with a prodigious memory, used to solving the cases entrusted to her with unorthodox methods. Accompanying her in her investigations across Basilicata is the police officer Ippazio Calogiuri, a shy and insecure boy, with whom a relationship of great complicity is established. But Imma is also a wife and mother and her husband Pietro, who is the exact opposite of her, and her daughter Valentina, struggling with a rebellious adolescence, are waiting for her at her house.",
