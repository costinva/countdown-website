  "overview": "Dan Savage, sex-advice columnist extraordinaire, is joining forces with MTV on a cross-country tour - visiting college campuses and answering students' most personal questions about sex, dating, and relationships. Savage U follows Dan as he drives into university towns across the U.S. answering ANY question with humor and brutal honesty. Along with his trusty sidekick, Lauren, and his popular Q&amp;A lecture, Dan will hit the streets of each campus, ready to get a real feel for what makes each school's sex and relationship culture unique. From the student center to nighttime hot spots, Dan will talk to students about what really goes on between the stacks, who's hooking up and who's holding back. And he'll give one-on-one advice and listen to students' unique questions, concerns, and curiosities about sex and relationships.",
