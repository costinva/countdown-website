  "overview": "A former outlaw and big-hearted father, Castaneda has not always been on the good side of life. Today he has only one goal: to give the best to his daughter. But when his daughter disappears, he breaks the rules to find her. The first hours are decisive and the police stations are understaffed so Castaneda will investigate in his own way: surrounded by people like him, anonymous people, without privileges or diplomas, they will crisscross the countryside to track down the kidnapper.",
