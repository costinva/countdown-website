  "overview": "World explorer Augustus Skinner has died and his four teenage grandkids have inherited the big, old Skinner Mansion and its contents. But Grandpa Skinner also left them a big surprise: the Skinners are now Guardians of the Lost Secrets, a collection of artifacts across the world that possess freaky powers, and crazy creatures that nobody ever believed really existed. In the wrong hands, the fabled Stone Maker could turn a whole army to stone or bring a stone army back to life! This is the flipped-out, fun and freakish world of the Skinner family.",
