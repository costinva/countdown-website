  "overview": "Little Ballers Indiana centers on six 11- and 12-year-old girls who meet as teammates and quickly form a sisterhood over the course of an AAU season. Coached by Diggins' stepdad, Moe Scott, these young phenoms have a deep passion for the game which holds special meaning and high stakes for each player such as: getting an education; team building; conquering physical challenges; improving self-esteem; and proving that girls are just as good at basketball as boys.",
