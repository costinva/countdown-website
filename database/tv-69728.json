  "overview": "Jian Bing  is a well-known advertising director in the industry, while Sheng Yang is a newcomer just entering society. They meet by chance at a restaurant—a recently divorced woman and a person waiting for love in vain. These two strangers form a bond and embark on a wondrous and romantic journey of love and personal growth. With Sheng Yang's companionship, Jian Bing regains confidence in life and love. Under Jian Bing's guidance and encouragement, Sheng Yang grows from an inexperienced and impulsive young man, showing his potential. They heal each other, grow together, and gradually develop feelings for each other. However, they face unavoidable obstacles in reality—identity and experience differences, opposition from their families, and workplace gossip. Jian Bing and Sheng Yang decide to leave the future in the hands of time. Three years bring about transformation and growth for both of them. They dedicate many first experiences to each other, and it is through this trust and shared journey that they become better versions of themselves. After going through twists and turns, they once again find their way back to each other.",
