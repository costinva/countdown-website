  "overview": "Marc-André is a marginal out of the system and in voluntary simplicity mode. He claims it's by choice. His friends François, Evelyne and Patrick all have meteoric careers in finance at Olstrom, except Vincent who took refuge in a civil service job after a burnout. François offers Marc-André an opportunity to return to the world of investment banking… but at the bottom of the ladder, it's a question of getting back on track. Will Marc-André accept the offer? Will he return to an environment he left four years ago, promising himself never to return to, this environment where he was successful but who got the better of him?",
