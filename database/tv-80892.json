  "overview": "Géolocaliser l'amour is the series adaptation of the eponymous novel by poems by Simon Boulerice. Through a succession of sexual conquests, we accompany Simon in his nomenclature of disappointments, emotions and disarray that pave the way for his search for a soul mate (or a one-night stand) on dating apps. . Behind the telling of these stories, each more anecdotal than the other, hides a deep loneliness and a need to feel wanted. Simon can only rely on the loyalty of his best friend, Jocelyn, and Siri to get him to say \"I love you\" without panicking. Will he be able to find love in the age of smart phones?",
