  "overview": "Pact met de Duivel delves into the most extensive and longest-running liquidation case ever in the Netherlands: the Passage trial. What drove the government to collaborate with murderers as crown witnesses? How were the deals made? The precursor to the Marengo trial still raises many questions. Was the trial conducted fairly? Or was it a case of justice being 'too big to fail'?",
