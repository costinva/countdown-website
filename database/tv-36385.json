  "overview": "Ulice is a contemporary daily soap with a strong feel good factor, offering stories of archetypal characters in archetypal situations. „The same thing's happened to me\" must be the feeling of viewers in the age category of 15-54 while watching the Czech Republic‘s first daily soap. For six years the Ulice team have succeeded in offering to both women and men, young and old, rich and poor, happy and disappointed, romantics and cynics, to those longing for humour, the emotions and the suspense of a fictitious world containing everything, to provoke their interest and addiction.",
