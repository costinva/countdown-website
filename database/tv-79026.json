  "overview": "Eating Media Lunch has presenter Jeremy Wells mercilessly mock all manner of mainstream media and \"issues of the day\" journalism whilst somehow managing to keep a straight face. A highly acclaimed media satire in the vein of the Daily Show, Eating Media Lunch bravely takes alternative views to mainstream media attitudes. As a result the material is invariably very funny and cutting edge. No fish is too big or barrel too small to be skewered by this oft-controversial current events show.",
