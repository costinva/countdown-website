  "overview": "Kyan Khojandi takes control of the French adaptation of HOT ONES! In each episode, he receives a personality for an unprecedented face-to-face on his career, his career and his commitments. The principle is simple. Reaching the end of the interview is much less soâ€¦ Ten big questions. Ten chicken nuggets. Ten sauces ranging from 1,700 to over 1 million on the Scoville scale (chilli pepper scale. Yes, yes it does exist.). To each question, its sauce! The more the interview progresses, the more the intensity of the chilli increases, acting as an increasingly strong disinhibitor on the personalities interviewed.",
