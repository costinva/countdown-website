  "overview": "Shun is a galactic civil engineer with a unique assignment: demolishing Earth to make way for a new intergalactic expressway. Naturally, earthlings have no clue of this impending doom.Â On his first day on earth, Chondan, the owner of a quaint Thai restaurant, enthralls Shun with his mouthwatering homemade dishes. Consequently, Shun secretly postpones his world-ending plan, lured by the promise of more delicious meals with Chondan. If he ever grows tired of the flavours, he can return to his original mission.",
