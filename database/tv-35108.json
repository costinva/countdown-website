  "overview": "Twelve people with eating disorders open their lives to the camera, allowing viewers to watch as they struggle to control the eating behaviors that are ruling their lives and threatening their health. Their extreme habits and bizarre rituals are both stunning and heartbreaking, from the young mother who feels she must wear layer upon layer of clothing to cover her \"deformed\" body to the woman whose comfort \"food\" is white chalkboard chalk. Experts and counselors work with each of the 12, hoping to start them on the journey to recovery.",
