  "overview": "Fearlessly innovative artist and Michelin-starred chef Richie Farina is bringing his creative chops to one of the most imaginative and competitive food arenas - carnival fairgrounds. At carnivals, the more out-there a dish is, the more people seem to like it, and the competition amongst the carnival chefs to create the most imaginative dish is fierce. On Carnival Kings, Richie wants in on all the action, as he travels to fairs across the country challenging carnival chef royalty in their own kingdoms to a cook-off featuring their famous fare. Real fairgoers determine whose version is better, earning the winning chef bragging rights and the throne. Get ready for a thrilling competition on Carnival Kings!",
