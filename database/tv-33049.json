  "overview": "Helen Czerski explores the incredible science of temperature. She'll take us from a starting point of the simple human sensations of heat and cold deep into the world of molecular physics, fluid dynamics and high-energy plasmas to reveal the mind-bending science that lies at the heart of this most immediate of our senses.She'll reveal that temperature is so much more than a nice hot cup of tea or the cool of a winter breeze. In fact, what we perceive as temperature is just our senses reacting to the vibration of atoms and molecules. But these vibrations have the ability to change the state of matter, forge new elements from old and start reactions that can transform the world in beautifully constructive or horrifically destructive ways.",
