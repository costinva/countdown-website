  "overview": "Just because a case is closed doesn't mean the truth has been revealed. Suicide or murder? Runaway or kidnapping? Accidental or premeditated? Each episode of Still a Mystery re-examines a single crime case where unanswered questions still remain. Through original interviews with law enforcement, family members and private investigators, news footage and social media, Still a Mystery dissects the evidence and presents new theories in a quest to uncover the truth.",
