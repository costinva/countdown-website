  "overview": "A story about eternal love. This young and immature but profound love \nthat even a cruel breakup cannot change. They took a decade yet still \ncannot heal their injured hearts. Even though they have found new \ncompanions they are still unable to quell their empty and lonely hearts.\n Who will make the first move to lure the other back? The love between \nmen and woman is like a war. Just a kiss, a smile or a confession and you will surrender. But he immediately \nannounced his marriage with another woman. Is this love or revenge? Ten \nyears ago she suddenly disappeared without a word. This caused him \nimmense pain throughout the years so is he seeking revenge? This \nso-called everlasting love perhaps is really no match for the hatred \nthat developed with the passing of time. ",
