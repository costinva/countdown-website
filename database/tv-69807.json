  "overview": "As China's first aircraft carrier began sea trials, the Chinese Navy formed its first carrier-based aircraft test flight team. Elite young pilots Xie Zhenyu and Yu Tao, led by Commander Qin Dadi, a decorated navy pilot, tackled the global challenge of carrier landing and takeoff with scientific rigor and a sense of mission and urgency. With the carrier fleet operational, Xie Zhenyu and Yu Tao, embodying \"the spirit of sea and air eagle,\" led China's jets soaring across vast skies.",
