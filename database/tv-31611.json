  "overview": "An explosive series following work of demolition, salvage and waste management experts as they blast, crush and smash their way through a variety of structures which have had their day. And once they're down, the real work begins.From tower blocks to ships, to bridges to Victorian mansionsâ€¦Every inch of material is removed as everything (and we mean everything) has value if you know where to take it and, more importantly, know when to sell it.With projects on this scale even a small shift in international metal markets could spell disaster for the Scrap Kings.",
