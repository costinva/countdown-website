  "overview": "A growing threat to democracies appears in the force of dictatorships. Dictators like Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Augusto Pinochet, Mobutu Sese Seko and Fidel Castro found their way to power through similar methods. Making a Dictator examines the brutal methods and common practices implemented by each dictatorship, along with the ways in which they corrupted the countries they claimed to improve.",
