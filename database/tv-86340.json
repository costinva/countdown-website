  "overview": "Pan Gaofeng, a young rocket development engineer born in the 1980s, joined the First Academy of Aerospace Science and Technology, the cradle of his country's launch vehicles, after graduating from graduate school. He was fortunate to be a member of the development team for the Long March 5 (CZ-5), my country's most powerful launch vehicle. Working alongside his predecessors and colleagues, he overcame numerous difficulties, overcame obstacles, and defied external ridicule and skepticism. He rose from the ashes of a failed launch to ultimately achieve success, marking a crucial step in my country's transition from a major space power to a leading space power.",
