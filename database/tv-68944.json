  "overview": "In this game, there is no starvation, no prizes, but endless luxury, emotions and eroticism. The reward is overcoming the temptation, i.e. keeping the old partner, or a new love woven in the fabulous environment, of course with one of the temptresses. Love dramas, tears, and scenes of jealousy can also be expected during the reality show, because the couples separated for twelve days can watch on video how their love behaves, or in the worst case, how he cheats on them with one of the seducers. The game is rich not only in drama, but also in excitement.",
