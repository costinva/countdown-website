  "overview": "Mi-Jin (Gang Ye-Won) is one of the mythical Korean creatures known as a \"gumiho\" - a fox with nine tails. Her mother (Jeon Mi-Seon) and younger sister Mi-Mo (Hyomin) were also a gumiho, but after consuming the livers of 1000 men they became human. Mi-Jin has now consumed 999 livers, but only has 3 months left to consume her 1,000th liver. If she is unable to find her 1000th liver, Mi-Jin will vanish. Meanwhile, Mi-Jin only takes the lives of men who she really loves.",
