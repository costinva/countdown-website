  "overview": "Mega Builders is a fast-paced, character-driven show that focuses on the world's biggest and most intriguing engineering challenges – the projects that are making history, and the people who are making it happen. The show relies heavily on \"at-the-scene\" verity and access to great characters. It's an up-close look at the pressure engineers and construction crews face every day… the stress of crushing deadlines, cost over-runs, and trying to achieve what often seems like the impossible. Mega Builders provides viewers with an exciting, stimulating, inside look at some of the most spectacular mega-projects of our time.",
