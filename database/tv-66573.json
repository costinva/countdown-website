  "overview": "Over 50,000 women fell in love with the German soldiers during the occupation. They were mocked, ostracized and considered traitors - because they transgressed against the honor of the nation and the men. For decades after liberation, their numbers and infatuation dwindled. That part of the story did not fit into the larger narrative of Denmark as a nation of resistance. Now their children tell the story of their mothers' German love.",
