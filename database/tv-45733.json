  "overview": "Each week, vegan and internet chef sensations Henry Firth and Ian Theasby are joined by guests in the kitchen for their signature quick, delicious, fuss-free recipes with wow presentation. Cooking up pizzas, burgers, curries, pies, big breakfasts, decadent desserts – nothing is off the menu. They'll show you just how easy it is to recreate all your favourite meals without the meat and dairy. There's plant-based breakfasts, meat and dairy-free lunches, vegan dinners, plus a dessert or delicious but healthy snack. Each dish stands alone, or the whole menu can cut down on meal prep time for the week ahead. ",
