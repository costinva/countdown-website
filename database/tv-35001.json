  "overview": "The first comedy travel-show with comedians from the project \"Do not sleep!\". Anton Shastun, Natalia Krasnov, Gar Dmitriev, Irina Saponaru and others travel around the world, and their stories about what they see are instantly turned into humorous numbers. A special feature of the show is that the travels are mostly filmed on the front camera of the smartphone, which gives the effect \"here and now\" - as if you really watch the live broadcast of friends from vacation. And then together with them you discuss the funniest moments of the trip and think out the absurd situations that could happen there. The starting point on the map of the \"Salfi\" show is Istanbul.",
