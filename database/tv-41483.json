  "overview": "Why do we feel such emotion when we enter a church, a temple, a mosque, or a synagogue? In these timeless spaces which our ancestors have bequeathed to us, there is a beauty and mystery which transport us. Sacred monuments have a complex and coded architecture which combines science and alchemy, the magical and the profane. But for those who know how to read them, these structures of wood, stone and glass tell the great narrative of human belief.Each of these very different edifices represents the pinnacle of what mankind has created on Earth. By revealing the secret history of the world's most remarkable religious constructions, this ambitious series in 4K also tells the history of Humankind, of our faith and our genius as builders.",
