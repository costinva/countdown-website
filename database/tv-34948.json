  "overview": "Meet the beauty queens of Pageant Place -- the gorgeous pageant girls who put on their sexiest swimsuits, biggest smiles and won the titles of Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss Universe. Ever wonder what it would be like to slip into a sash and walk in the high-heeled shoes of headline makers like former Miss USA Tara Conner or Miss Teen USA Katie Blair? Well, here's your chance! Did you know that every year, the reigning Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss Universe live together in a luxurious NYC apartment owned by real estate and business mogul Donald Trump? It's true! And consistent with the business they're in, within the walls of that gorgeous flat, the crowned princesses constantly vie to be the center of attention. But the only way to truly know what goes on behind closed doors is to take up residence in Pageant Place, and that's what MTV is doing with Miss USA Rachel Smith, Miss Teen USA Katie Blair and Miss Universe Riyo Mori. With old pageant pro Tara Conner by their sides, we'll be right there as they maneuver through a whole new world of photographers and endless appearances at events where they're always expected to look poised and perky. We'll see that sometimes it's hard to smile when things just aren't going their way. Behind the evening gowns and glamour lie catfights, late nights and plenty of tabloid fodder.",
