  "overview": "The entertaining potboiler follows the extraordinary chronicles of Panauti â€˜Bhagyesh', a man whose reputation for bad luck is so notorious that residents of Raniganj would rather stay home than cross paths with him. Panauti's only dream is to reopen the infamous Menka theatre and restore his father's legacy. His journey is packed with unexpected, uproarious twists and turns, plunging him into one outrageous predicament after another. With a cast of colourful characters and laugh-out-loud misadventures, Panauti and his cousin Battu's quest for love and luck is a rollercoaster of hilarity and heart that will leave audiences in splits and on the edge of their seats.",
