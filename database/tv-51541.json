  "overview": "Australia's answer to South Park, Regular Old Bogan is an adult animated comedy series with a big heart and even bigger balls. This love letter to Australia revolves around the adventures of a typical family from the outer suburbs - the Stubbs. Rather than sitting at home firing up the barbie and talking about the latest specials at ALDI, this regular old family encounter outrageous situations in each episode - from getting lost in the outback, to facing Death Row in a Balinese prison.Â ",
