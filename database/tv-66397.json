  "overview": "Detective Gosha Kotov since childhood dreams of being as cool as his legendary father, who died in the line of duty back in the nineties. But for him to succeed, a miracle must happen. At first, Gosha is not very good at catching criminals, because he is a coward, but by the will of circumstances, Gosha is bitten by an infected dog: the guy acquires superpowers and becomes a werewolf - incredibly strong and dexterous, with a heightened sense of smell and hearing. But what remains unchanged in Gaucher is his keen sense of justice. From that moment on, Gosha begins to actively fight crime, as well as solve his personal problems. And the more he uses his newfound power, the more he becomes its hostage. Gaucher will have to pass the test of power, win love and realize that great power comes with great responsibility.",
