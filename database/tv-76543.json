  "overview": "In the First World War more than 80% of Australian fatalities occurred on the main battlefield, facing the main force of the enemy. That battlefield was the Western Front. Australians and New Zealanders were continuously engaged in that theatre from early 1916 until the Armistice, late in 1918. Anzac Battlefields tells the story of the ANZACs on the Western Front, from their first engagement in a small trench raid until their final triumph as an integral part of the \"100 Day\" advance that led to victory. Through graphics, archive, oral history and travels across the scenes of past battles, Neil Pigot and eminent military historian Dr. Peter Pedersen explain where, why and how the ANZACs fought in France and Belgium 100 years ago.",
