  "overview": "On Call is an adrenalized and visceral police drama that puts us inside the squad car and on the streets with Long Beach Police. Through training officer Traci Harmon and rookie Alex Diaz, the series examines how the complexities of the job affects the human condition. Harmon will be enlightened by a kid from the streets, while Diaz will learn that policing isn't black and white - it requires shades of grey. Each episode tracks the duo as they respond to a new radio call, arriving on the scene to resolve an incident. Incorporating a mixture of bodycam, dash-camera, and cellphone footage to create a cinema verit√© effect, the innovative series explores the morality of protecting and serving a community.",
