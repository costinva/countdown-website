  "overview": "They agreed to play the game, to let themselves be completely surprised, moved, sometimes even destabilized because they will discover at the same time as the viewers a surprise: a song that is dear to them revisited and reinterpreted by an artist. Spectacular staging in the service of emotion ... And strong emotions for the artist sitting in the armchair thanks to the arrival on the set of relatives and unexpected guests. Viewers will have a front row seat to experience these moments of rare musical intimacy.",
