An important character who appears in all six is Sam McCready, a Secret Intelligence Service agent who has become an author but continues to work on SIS operations. He plays the lead in most of the films, but in A Little Piece of Sunshine he has more of a supporting role. Each of the stories are introduced on screen by Frederick Forsyth.",
