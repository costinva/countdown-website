  "overview": "Divorce Court began as a dramatized court show in 1957, but later and presently is an arbitration-based reality court show. The program is nontraditional within the judicial genre as it mostly resolves the disputes of couples facing the end of their relationship. It has been presided over by many television personalities: former Cleveland Heights Municipal Court Judge Lynn Toler and Judge Mablean Ephraim, Judge Faith Jenkins, and currently Judge Star Jones.Â  Divorce Court is produced by Lincolnwood Drive, Inc. and distributed by Fox First Run.",
