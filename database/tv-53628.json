  "overview": "Three single girls live in a paying guest accommodation run by Nimmi aunty in saadi Dilli. What could have been a simple, straightforward and peaceful living arrangement for all three is anything but. From late night parties to idiotic boyfriends, hilarious misunderstandings to hiding secrets, the girls' life in the PG accommodation is total siyappa. Meanwhile, Nimmi aunty is not to be left behind either. Turns out, gossiping and Patiala peg aren't the only things she enjoys; she needs the occasional tadka of sattebaazi to spice up her life. Welcome to the wild world of Nimmi's PG!",
