Judas, Santa Claus' second-in-command, must send out an expedition to retrieve the magical medallion from a mail-order shop at a deserted gas station. The expedition, consisting of the three completely useless elves Rolf, Trond and Jerry, has a very dangerous journey ahead of them, and only they can save Santa Claus and save Christmas.",
