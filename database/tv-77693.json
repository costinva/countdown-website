  "overview": "In this crafty cookery series, beloved TV chef Nadiya Hussain is back on our screens and this time she's showing the country how you can make your ingredients stretch further than you could ever imagine by sharing recipes that align with her philosophy â€˜cook once and eat twice'. We will see Nadiya spinning leftovers into exciting and genuinely new recipes that make eating something for the second time as enticing as the first; rustling up convenient batch friendly bakes and treats to eat now and freeze/store for later; or turning otherwise-wasted-ingredients into thrilling new meals encouraging us to make the most of every second we spend in the kitchen.",
