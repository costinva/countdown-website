  "overview": "Ira is a wayward 30-year-old Muscovite who does not recognize the rules and foundations of modern society. Throughout the season, she easily breaks the fourth wall and openly discusses with the viewer everything that worries her. Topics for reflection and introspection are completely different: from mortgages and a night run to the refrigerator to cleaning the apartment and the impact of female pads on the fur seal population. And okay cats. In Ira's personal life, too, not everything is in order. She meets with the hysterical screenwriter Sergei, but the explosive nature of the woman does not allow them to be together all the time, so the couple quarrels regularly.",
