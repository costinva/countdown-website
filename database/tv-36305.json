  "overview": "Ed vs. Spencer focuses on two best friends, Ed and Spencer, who are constantly competing against each other in unusual and weird challenges for supremacy and bragging rights. Spencer is a doe-eyed innocent who steadfastly believes in hard work and persistence. In contrast, Ed will lie, cheat and do whatever else he can to beat his friend. At the end of the programme, the loser had to undergo a humiliating forfeit chosen by the victor.",
