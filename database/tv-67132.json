Now a multi-millionaire, Loïc lives with his wife and children in a 5 Star Hotel in Geneva. He meets a marginalized financial advisor, Jean-Hubert, who offers to help him realize his big dream: to conquer Montrex, the prestigious watch brand that fired his father after years of loyal service. But as an inveterate loser, Loïc will lose everything in one evening and one card game.",
