  "overview": "The actor, famed for his role as formidable patriarch Logan Roy in the hit drama Succession, explores society's complicated relationship with money and wealth, and looks back at his own personal journey from growing up in poverty to becoming a Hollywood actor. Throughout the series, Brian spends time with people from all walks of life in a bid disentangle the link between money and happiness, from homeless people in the streets of Harlem to super models on Miami beach, and also addresses his own anger at the growing wealth gap which polarises the rich and the poor across the globe.",
