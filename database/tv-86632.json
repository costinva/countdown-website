In search of answers, Lisa arrives at an old yet picturesque house on the shore of Crystal Springs Lake. This house is more than just an inheritance — it's the crossroads of two people's fates united by a common goal. Her new acquaintance, the charismatic and stubborn Mykhailo Stolyar, is also vying for guardianship. Under one roof, they face not only the challenge of becoming a family for the girl but also a dangerous game of emotions that's impossible to ignore.",
