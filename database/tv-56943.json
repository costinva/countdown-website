  "overview": "In November 2017, the cultural figure Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a Swedish Academy member, was accused of sexual assault and subsequently convicted on two counts of rape. The ensuing scandal created headlines around the world, forced a wave of resignations at the Academy and called the continued existence of one of the world's most prestigious cultural institutions into question.Featuring in-depth interviews with several of the women victimised by Arnault, and with members of the Swedish Academy and international experts, The Prize of Silence explores urgent themes such as the objectification and exploitation of women in apparently respectable environments, and how the fear of additional suffering can deter victims from speaking up.",
