  "overview": "Don Coyote is a swordsman who goes around saving people. With the help of Don Coyote's noble horse Rosinante, Sancho Panda and his voice-of-cynicism donkey Dapple, these crusaders of chivalry ride the countryside fighting for truth, justice, and beauty. Their attempts to do so are complicated by Don Coyote's state of mental unbalance and constantly mistaking everyday objects for horrific monsters.",
