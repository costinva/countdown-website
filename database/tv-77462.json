  "overview": "Noah Morgan loves her quiet, normal life in her town. But when her mother returns from a cruise unexpectedly married to a billionaire and announces they are moving into his mansion, Noah is suddenly shoved out of her comfort zone and into a glittering world of illegal street races, lavish pool parties, and spoiled rich kids. And her new stepbrother, Nicholas, is the most spoiled of them all. Arrogant, aloof, and viciously attractive, Nick is everything she hates, especially when she learns his bad boy persona isn't just a fa√ßade. She's spent her life running from danger, and Nick is danger incarnate. Yet neither of them can prevent the powerful attraction that flares between them, enough to turn their worlds upside-down and tempt them beyond all reason. But Noah's past may be even more dangerous than their forbidden romance. And if he wants her, Nick will have to decide if he's willing to risk everything.",
