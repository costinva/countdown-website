  "overview": "A series spotlighting America's prime standup comics, caught in the act, usually at the Vic Theatre in Chicago. Each edition showed a single performer working an enthusiastic live audience. The fact that the broadcasts were made for screening by cable company HBO ensured that the comedians could be liberal with their vocabulary and choice of subject matter. \t\t\t",
