  "overview": "The lights go out over the second link bridge between Malaysia and Singapore and when they come back on, a body is found exactly halfway between the two countries--split in half and made up of two different women. Two detectives from each country, Megat and Serena, are assigned to investigate the double murder. The pair couldn't be more different--Singaporean Serena is young and brilliant but socially-awkward, a stickler for rules and a general pain-in-the-butt. Malaysian Megat is an experienced, impulsive go-with-the-gut type who oozes charm. They soon realise that they are forced to work together on this seemingly political and highly complex case.",
