  "overview": "Beyond Invention is a series about the scientists, inventors and researchers who search for truth beyond normal boundaries and shatter our illusions of reality.Beyond Invention is a unique series, which looks at the weird world of invention and people using science in strange ways. Shot in the UK, Australia, Canada and the US, the 8 hour series (24 segments) runs the gamut from New energy (anti-gravity)featuring far out inventors, Mystery Creature hunters (sea serpents, Bigfoot,etc.)cloning, crazy flying machines, odd gadgets, sex machines, animal inspired innovations. We explore a world normally only seen in Hollywood science fiction movies: true \"sci-fi\" science that's here and now at some of the world's top medical, digital and military laboratories.—Peter von Puttkamer (Producer)  [from IMDb]",
