  "overview": "In February 2023, two catastrophic earthquakes surprise the Turkish-Syrian border region. Observers speak of the consequences as an earthquake of the century. The SEEBA special unit of the Technical Relief Agency should also help. For THW dog handler Evi Kümper and operations manager Timo Eilhardt, who are volunteering, this will be the mission of a lifetime. Now they have to show what they have practiced for many years. You immerse yourself in the apocalypse in the crisis area. Tens of thousands dead and they are looking for a needle in a haystack: buried survivors.",
