  "overview": "Preppers follows Charlie, a young Aboriginal woman, who experiences her own personal, cataclysmic event when her life crumbles around her. Escaping the fallout, Charlie finds herself at the centre of a hilariously mismatched community of doomsday preppers. With climate change, Donald Trump, economic catastrophe, terrorism, pandemics, meteor strikes, hostile AI, nuclear proliferation, alien invasion it looks almost certain that the end is nigh. In Australia colonisation was an apocalypse that happened only 200 years ago. So, when the end comes—no matter how it happens— maybe the craziest thing is to NOT be prepared?",
