  "overview": "Veneno and Noivo are capoeiristas who grew up as brothers, but a brutal crime separated them. Years later, their paths cross: Veneno lives in the underworld of clandestine fights while Noivo protects Ventania, the daughter of his murdered master, and tries to recover what was lost between him and his friend. In the ring and in life, they'll have to decide how far they're willing to go to settle the past.",
