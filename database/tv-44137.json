  "overview": "A detective series with an accent of black humour that transports us into the misty territory of the Northern Crown, where one trick attracts another. It features petty criminals who do not always understand the scope of their actions. Gradually, we enter a game of chat and mouse between the police and the bandits. A game from which no one will emerge unscathed.",
