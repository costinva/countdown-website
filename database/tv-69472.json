  "overview": "CEO Liu Qingying, due to her single-minded focus on her career, faced a crisis when her employees and fans turned against her on the Internet. In order to save her career, she had no choice but to make a deal with the Lord of Xiliang, crossing over to Xiliang to help him overcome a life-or-death crisis. However, Liu Qingying never expected that this Lord of Xiliang had a multitude of male favorites in his harem, and they all wanted to share her bed! In order to discourage the male consorts from serving the Lord, Liu Qingying decided to exclusively favor Zhen Wan, a commoner who was forcibly brought to the Lord's harem. However, at this moment, Liu Qingying was unaware that Zhen Wan was actually burdened with the mission of assassinating the Lord.",
