  "overview": "Ayako is a gung-ho young detective in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's violent crimes unit who's eager to make her name. One day she gets her big break: the chance to arrest a murder suspect single-handed. But before she can slap on the cuffs their souls are switched! She finds herself in the body of Haruto, a brilliant and successful young entrepreneur with his own startup who's secretly a psychopathic serial killerâ€”and he in hers. This bizarre exchange of souls sets the stage for a thrilling story that turns everything you thought you knew about men and women and good and evil on its head. As Ayako and Haruto are drawn closer together, these two natural enemies stumble onto an unexpected truth.",
