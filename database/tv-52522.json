  "overview": "Although he was never a household name, Nygård built an international fashion empire worth hundreds of millions of dollars and quickly learned how to spend the vast fortune he amassed. Nygård led an extravagant playboy lifestyle, constantly surrounded by beautiful, young women, and owned a set of lavish homes - including a massive six-acre estate he built in the Bahamas, designed to look like a Mayan temple. But hiding beneath the outlandish public persona, scores of women say, was a dangerous sexual predator who 'practiced' and 'perfected' the crime of sexual assault for decades. More than 80 women in the Bahamas, Canada and the United States have joined a class action lawsuit accusing Nygård and his companies of rape, sexual assault, and sex trafficking dating back to the 1970s. Their accusations have led to an investigation by the FBI and ultimately Nygård's arrest this week in Canada for extradition to the United States. Unseamly: The Investigation of Peter Nygård takes a deeper look into these accusations and explores Nygård's life - from his humble beginnings, to his career in the fashion industry, and the public feud with a powerful neighbor that exposed the countless alleged sexual assault and trafficking allegations brought against him.",
