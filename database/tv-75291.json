  "overview": "In a city of light that never sees sunlight all year round, Lin Feng was influenced by his father, Dr. Helium, since he was a child. He realized that the city of light was not a refuge for humans, but had become a cage trapping humans. Lin Feng formed a fighting alliance and took desperate risks to fight to the death with Mr. Krypton, the big boss behind the scenes, and bring the sunshine back to the City of Light.",
