  "overview": "There are some things you don't learn in history class... The 'Bad Bad Belgium' series tells those stories that were deliberately deleted from the collective memory. From the Belgian involvement in the atomic bombs in the 1940s, through the controversial start of Flemish mass tourism in the 1960s, to the first Belgian ecstasy pill in the 1990s.",
