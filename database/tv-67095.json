  "overview": "NAKED AND AFRAID survivalists have endured the most grueling environments on earth and proved the value of teamwork in overcoming brutal conditions. In this all-new series, eight of the franchise's most battle-tested survivalists will attempt to endure 21 days completely SOLO. This arced series takes place in some of the most remote and harshest environments in the world – and in locations spread out over three continents. Whether it's a bug-infested South American rainforest, a frigid African scrubland or a blistering Mexican jungle, each episode follows multiple survivalists as they take on the most difficult challenge of their lives.With no one to lean on for help, their success depends solely on their own ingenuity, skills and will to survive. Enduring 21 days naked with a partner is hard enough. Enduring 21 days solo will test the most experienced survivalists in the world – and bring many to their knees.",
