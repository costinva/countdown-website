  "overview": "They say that variety is the spice of life. Well, Indian cuisine is abundant with both spice and variety! But how did the Indian palate come to be this colorful? The answer lies in the royal kitchens of India. Indian Royalty are the custodians of the ancient culinary traditions. Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan takes us through the history of food prepared in the royal kitchens of India, whose blending of foreign imports, rare fowls, elaborate preparation methods and local herbs, created some of the best and most flavorful food in the country. We get to experience the tales of extravagance and eccentricity, of desperation and innovation, and of happy accidents. The royal love for creativity and uniqueness have led to a rich culinary tradition that makes Indian cuisine one of the most exciting ones in the world.",
