  "overview": "Dishonoured warrior, Waka Nuku Rau, dies, but the Ancestors in the Afterlife send him back to the world to find redemption and honour. There, in the world of the living, he's aided by Mehe, a young woman determined to make sure he does, and together they discover the world has been disrupted by forces not of the living world. Someone, or something, is preventing the Dead from entering the Afterlife and now the Dead are thrown back into their decaying bodies to hunt the living. Waka and Mehe go on a long journey to discover who created the rift between the world of the living and the world of the dead.",
