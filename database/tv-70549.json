  "overview": "It is December, and the whole of Denmark is ready to celebrate Christmas. But for one (almost) completely ordinary family, Christmas has come as a big surprise. We are of course talking about the Krumborg Family - better known as the Krummers. Grandpa wants to celebrate Christmas, but big sister Stine does not want to! Krummemor wants to have a do-it-yourself Christmas, while Krumme is busy proving that Santa Claus exists. Little brother Grunk writes letters to Santa every day, but because he is the only one, Santa finds it difficult to get in the Christmas mood.",
