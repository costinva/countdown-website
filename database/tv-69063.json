  "overview": "A group of Polish burlesque and drag performers. The community they create together allows them to be who they want to be and to realise any of their creations and fantasies. In their world, no one has to do anything, every body is beautiful and every love is possible. Unfortunately, this freedom comes at a price. Poland is a country that is increasingly talked about in the world in the context of racism, sexism and homophobia.",
