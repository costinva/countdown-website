  "overview": "Set in present-day Chicago, 61st Street is a gripping drama that follows Moses Johnson, a promising high school athlete, who is swept up into the infamously corrupt Chicago criminal justice system. Taken by the police as a gang member, he soon finds himself in the eye of the storm as police and prosecutors seek revenge for the death of an officer during a drug bust gone wrong. A timely examination of the institutional racism plaguing cities nationwide, 61st Street plumbs the depths of systemic abuse happening in some of the country's most vulnerable communities.",
