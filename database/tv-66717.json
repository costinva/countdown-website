  "overview": "Bára Veselá has bad luck on her heels and is on the run from justice. Coincidentally, she somewhat involuntarily becomes a saleswoman for the fashion department at the just-opened department store Zlatá labuť. It is literally a breathtaking palace of luxury and a new modern landmark of the center of Prague. History walks behind its luxurious storefronts. It is March 15, 1939, and Nazi occupation troops are crossing the Czechoslovakian state border.",
