  "overview": "Lambing Live is a farming programme. Presented by Kate Humble and Adam Henson, the show was mainly filmed live on the Beavan family farm, near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire and followed a week in the life of the farm, concentrating on the births of the new lambs. Filmed inserts showed the lead-up to the lambing season, including the purchase of two new stud sheep (tups).",
