  "overview": "Veera, Jayati and Kavita, tired of abusive and unloving husbands, plan and execute the murder of their husbands in what they make look like a boat accident. It was an almost perfect plan, as the boat blew up mid sea, when the three couples had gone for a quick vacation, in what looked like a simple boating accident. It's a secret the three women share, a secret that will help them move on from the drudgery of their unhappy lives. How they get out and save themselves is what forms the spine of the series.",
