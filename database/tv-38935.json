  "overview": "The boys are back! Following the success of their ITV Christmas Special, Gordon, Gino and Fred's Great Christmas Roast, the boys are hitting Europe for an adventure no one will forget. This time it's personal as each episode takes us on a tour of their cherished homelands, each of them with a special occasion to prepare for. With three countries, three weeks and three coqs au vin in close confinement what could possibly go wrong? Gordon Ramsay, Gino D'Acampo and Fred Sirieix hit the road to find out which of their countries does it best and immerse themselves in the most extreme adventures, competing to find the best ingredients from some of the most stunning locations. This is food on tour like never before, but will it be a case of too many cooks?",
