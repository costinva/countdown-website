  "overview": "Vidiots follows the adventures of two lovable fools; James Marsters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Smallville), and Mark Devine (Sex and the City, CSI Miami) as they travel the globe with their trusty PS4. During the day they explore distant cities and foreign countries, meet with journalists and fans, and record TV and movies. However, the jet setting is just an excuse to give them time at night for their favorite pursuit; playing video games, often with their celebrity friends. Filmed guerrilla style, this behind the scenes series is a raw, madcap look at the lives of two world travelers who really just want to get their game on.",
