  "overview": "LuLaRich chronicles the unraveling of LuLaRoe. Known for their buttery soft leggings, the infamous multi-level marketing company went viral promising young mothers a work-from-home salvation. Capitalizing on the growing power of social media, LuLaRoe's eccentric founders recruited an astonishing army of independent retailers to peddle its increasingly bizarre and defective clothing products.  Through exclusive interviews, this series unveils how it all went wrong in a spectacularly weird and comedic fashion.",
