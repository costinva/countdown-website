  "overview": "Sometimes in a woman's life, passions boil over and lead them to do things that – in ordinary circumstances – they would never dream of doing. And sometimes this manifests itself in a desire for intimacy. This omnibus-style drama series focuses on a different woman in each episode, focusing on the series of events that led up to a single instance of \"transforming into an animal.\"In the first episode, a 28-year-old woman has been living together with her boyfriend for three years and is frustrated by the fact that their relationship has become completely sexless. When she attends a school reunion, however, she finds herself drawn to an ex-classmate. Will she indulge in her passions? In another episode, a 29-year-old woman who is in an awkward relationship with her boyfriend has a row with him in a restaurant. In another, a woman considers the idea of workplace romance – while in another, a geeky junior college student (Sakanoue Akane) with no experience in love edges toward her first intimate encounter!  ",
