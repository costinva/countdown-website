  "overview": "Internationally renowned historian and broadcaster, James Holland, takes a deep dive into key events from the Second World War, bringing incredible stories to life for a new generation, and offering new research and analysis to enhance our understanding of the most consequential war of the 20th Century.Each episode follows Holland buddying up with a fellow expert companion to explore the locations, characters and hardware that bring each story to life. Holland and his guests travel to Lyon to learn about the downfall of the French Resistance leader, Jean Moulin; to Rauray to follow an epic tank battle; to Monte Cassino in the footsteps of the incredible Polish forces, and across the UK to explore how the development of a single aircraft contributed to making possible the D-Day landings.On location, we get a sense of how each story played out, alongside Holland's re-telling, and the interpretation of its importance and impact as he analyses each event with his companion, illustrated with archive imagery, records and animated sequences.",
