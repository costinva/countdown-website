  "overview": "Blogger-millionaire Alex Go (Egor Kiryachok) loses all contracts, offending a young fan Mitya Lipkin (Mark Doronin) on the air. To save his career, Alex, who does not like children too much, goes to desperate measures — taking a smartphone and a producer with him, becomes a counselor at the Yunost camp somewhere in the middle of Russia. After all, it's summer, and Mitya is going to this camp for a vacation, and Alex hopes to make friends with the kid or at least portray friendship on camera. Subscribers and the producer fade into the background, now the fate of the blogger depends on the children and the cunning director (Alexey Maklakov), who, with the help of an Internet star, hopes to add popularity to the camp.",
