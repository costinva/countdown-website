  "overview": "From piping hot beignets borne in the French Quarter, to icy cold sake made with Louisiana–grown rice, New Orleans' unique blend of tradition and innovation is what fuels Emeril's cooking. Each week on Emeril Cooks, we'll meet a New Orleans local who sparks Emeril's culinary imagination. Guests like the crawfish concierge at a luxury hotel, or a local farmer (known as The Mushroom Lady) who helps keep Emeril's classic smoked mushroom pasta on the menu. We'll invite these special guests into Emeril's kitchen where they'll see firsthand how he makes the dishes they helped inspire.  ",
