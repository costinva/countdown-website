  "overview": "Follows a group of men who travel through \"Iceberg Alley\", the world's most densely packed gathering of icebergs, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. Once out on the open seas, the crew is at the mercy of Mother Nature, facing storms, ice sheets, hypothermia-inducing waters, dense fog, rough seas, and unpredictable massive icebergs. They search for, wrangle and harvest ice, and bring it back to land for the production of pure bottled water and vodka.",
