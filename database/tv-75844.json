  "overview": "Tic Tac Dough is an update of NBCUniversal's classic format originally created by Robert Noah. The show is hosted by the incomparable Brooke Burns (\"Master Minds\", \"The Chase\"), who guides two contestants as they compete to place three of their marks in a row on the giant trivia board. After three rounds, the winning player moves on to face the dragon in the grand prize round, where the dragon moves strategically on the board to block the player's ability to make three-in-a-row and take home $10,000.",
