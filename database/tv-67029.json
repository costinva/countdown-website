  "overview": "The Sound Collector is all about sound - as heard through the ears of a small but very active little being called the Sound Collector, who has a passion for sound despite being hard of hearing.The Sound Collector spends his days discovering and using new sounds that he finds on his adventures: the blooping and popping of sea anemones, the hissing of the tide drawing back along a pebble beach or even the snores and snuffles of his best friend and pet, Mole. He is endlessly fascinated by the world around him and whether he loves sound because of, or despite his hearing, it is the focus of his life in an incredibly positive way.",
