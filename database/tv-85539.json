  "overview": "Due to his worsening health, Zülfikar Karslı begins to lose his former influence at the bus terminal. Meanwhile, all eyes are on his son Zafer, who is rumored to be returning soon from abroad. At the same time, Timur, a roaming repairman struggling under the weight of debts left by his father, crosses paths with this secret-laden family. Unknowingly, he steps into a fate he never imagined—as the successor to Zülfikar: Zafer Karslı. From that moment on, nothing will ever be the same for Zülfikar's children: Kudret, Derya, Cennet, Zafer, and Zafer's wife Reyhan.",
