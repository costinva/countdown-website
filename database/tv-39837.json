  "overview": "Hunting is not only violence, blood and guts, it is also a communion with nature, a way of life and beautiful encounters. That's why we opened our Club. Inside, there are the finest triggers in the region! And a bar ... We are all passionate! It's simple, we hunt all the time! We hunt on foot, with dogs, friends, in a car ... Sometimes, we even hunt fishing, or at home ... It's always action and emotion. In a word, for us hunting it is not practiced, it is lived!",
