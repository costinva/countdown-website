  "overview": "\"College GameDay\" has been a popular college football pregame show on ESPN since 1987 and has been taking the show to college campuses across the country since 1993. Now the same concept is being used on SEC Nation a flagship show on ESPN-owned SEC Network. Rather than discussing games from all conferences, the show features games involving teams of the titular conference and originates at a location in SEC country. ``SEC Nation'' is hosted by Joe Tessitore, who is joined by radio host Paul Finebaum, former players Greg McElroy and Marcus Spears, and reporter Kaylee Hartung to preview the day's games.",
