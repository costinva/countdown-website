  "overview": "Ibn-i Sina is a curious boy who seeks to discover knowledge, does not fit into his container, and has an intelligence beyond his time. He reads Aristotle's Metaphysics book many times in order to understand it, does research instead of playing games like his peers, and mostly talks with his best friend, the goat Socrates.",
