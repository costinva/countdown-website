  "overview": "In 2002, newly graduated An Yan was assigned to teach at Heping Middle School in Changzhi County. Initially struggling to adapt to the rural environment and educational philosophy, she gradually came to value the significance of rural education and the sense of \"being needed\" through her interactions with students and home visits. Inspired by former principal Yu Tian and current principal Fu Shengzhi, An Yan embraced and carried forward the educational principles of \"preservation\" and \"nurturing,\" becoming a well-regarded teacher. By 2012, An Yan had advanced to vice principal, overseeing logistics and successfully implementing the \"nutritional lunch\" program. In 2016, she was appointed principal of a relocated poverty alleviation school. Despite facing challenges with a weak teaching foundation and complex student backgrounds, An Yan and a team of dedicated rural teachers tackled each issue, creating a quality learning environment for the students. Like An Yan, rural educators tirelessly work to help students from mountain villages reach new heights.",
