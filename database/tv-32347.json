  "overview": "Set during the height of the Celtic Tiger financial boom of the millennium, Dublin Murders is focused on two murder investigations led by ambitious and charismatic Detectives Rob Reilly and Cassie Maddox. The victims - a young talented ballerina who is found dead on an ancient stone altar; and a vivacious free-spirited woman, who is found stabbed in a roofless famine cottage - are seemingly unrelated, but as we will discover, are actually knitted together by powerful shared themes - the macabre â€˜red in tooth and claw' elements of both stories, and their heart-thumping psychological thriller qualities.",
