  "overview": "Mini-series set in the famous KaDeWe department store, founded in the 1920s by Jewish-German entrepreneur Adolf Jandorf. The KaDeWe still exists in western Berlin, and is considered an important architectural and cultural symbol of the city. In the so-called Roaring Twenties, Berlin was a modern metropolis with a vibrant nightlife, where sexual diversity and social utopias were part of everyday life. But at the same time, it was a period when political radicalisation arose as well as concerns owing to inflation.",
