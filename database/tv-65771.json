  "overview": "Set in the city of Kittydale, each SuperKitties episode features two stories as the four kittens, cuddled up at the Purr 'N' Play playspace or out playing around town, receive a \"SuperKitty Call\" from one of their animal friends with a problem that only the SuperKitties can help with, usually caused by one of the comedic villains in the series: Cat Burglar, Mr. Puppypaws, Lab Rat or Zsa-Zsa. With plenty of super skills and gadgets at their disposal, the SuperKitties set off to thwart the villains' plans and impart important messages along the way.",
