  "overview": "De Kazakkendraaiers is a panel program by and with Bart De Pauw. Each week, two teams playfully pay tribute to rhetoric. The guest players who assist the captains Bart De Pauw and David Galle are funny celebrities, actors, stand-up comedians and other well-known or lesser-known comic talent. The two permanent captains compete against each other with a teammate in assignments they have devised for each other. Both in the studio and in real life they have to try to get out of sticky situations with their only weapons being their assertiveness, their powers of persuasion and a good dose of nonsense.",
