  "overview": "A detective series about the everyday life of operas of the \"homicide\" department of the Petrovsky District Police Department of St. Petersburg. Five – because there are five operas. Major Pavel Shaposhnikov, Captains Dmitry Krasavchenko, Timur Bubnov, Anton Vetrov and Senior Lieutenant Vladimir Kuzmin. Five different characters who were united by their commander, Lieutenant Colonel Andrei Golovanov. A man with great humor and a rich past. He still remembers when there were streets of broken lanterns in St. Petersburg. Time has changed, the police have become the police, the city has been transformed, but human passions are still boiling with might and main. Revenge, envy, fear, lust, greed drive some to commit crimes, while honor, conscience, justice and courage force others to resist evil. The heroes of the Magnificent Five punish evil on a daily basis. Surprisingly, in this routine they have time for love, friendship and humor.",
