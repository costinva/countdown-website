  "overview": "After hosting \"Live\" with guest co-hosts for nearly a year, Kelly Ripa gets a permanent co-host -- and it's a name that is familiar to people: Ryan Seacrest. The show kicks off with Kelly and Ryan discussing what is going on in their lives and in pop culture -- with producer Michael Gelman often chiming in with his own musings. The episodes focus on the hosts chatting things up with their guests and enjoying performances by musical guests. Viewers also get a chance to win prizes -- usually vacations -- by correctly answering trivia questions posed by the emcees.",
