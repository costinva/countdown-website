  "overview": "Domino is a powerful young witch who is haunted by her need to feed on the energy of others. A hunger that only grows, despite her attempt to start her life over in Manchester, where she is desperately seeking a community who can help her understand what is happening to her. But Domino doesn't need to try so hard - a coven of witches are already tracking her every move, convinced they have to stop her before her powers destroy everyone and everything around her.",
