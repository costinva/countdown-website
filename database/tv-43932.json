  "overview": "Suzanne Sugarbaker goes to Washington, D.C., to fill the congressional seat of her late husband, Ray, as a favor to the governor. To help her feel more at home, Suzanne brings along Jim, her mentally challenged brother, and her adopted daughter, Desiree. Her staff is a diverse bunch: uptight and brittle administrative assistant Natalie Hollingsworth, press secretary (and recovering alcoholic) Sissy Emerson and Jennifer Malone, a fragile housewife trying to recover from being abandoned by her husband. Later, new intern Veda Walkman joins the team.",
