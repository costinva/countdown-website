  "overview": "Yatora Yaguchi is a fairly popular student who excels in school, but often deals with inner emptiness and frustrations. One day he became fascinated by a painting at his high school's art club so deeply that it inspired him to try his hand at painting. Later he was inspired by a friend Ryuji and subsequently joining the art club, becoming more deeply involved, and attempts to apply for the Tokyo University of the Arts as his choice of college.",
