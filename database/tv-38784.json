  "overview": "For decades, no other muscle car ruled the roads like the Trans Am. So when the automotive icon fell into oblivion, car savants Scott and Tod Warmack risked everything to acquire the rights in an attempt to resurrect the legendary brand from extinction. Now, builder Scott and businessman Tod are giving the greenlight to the Trans Am legacy by restoring old muscle cars and building new ones to breathe life back into American muscle and put the beloved car back on the pavement.",
