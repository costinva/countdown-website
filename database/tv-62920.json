  "overview": "Everyone loves a good beef ... especially when celebrities are involved! Joel McHale returns to the network as host of this good old-fashioned beef-squashing cook-off. Each week two celebrities will go head-to-head in a light-hearted face-off, knives in hand and spices on the rack, ready to cook the best dish this side of the Hollywood Hills. Joel acts as prosecutor, judge and jury, ultimately crowning one celeb the winner of the cook-off as well as helping the celebrities squash their beef once and for all.",
