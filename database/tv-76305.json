  "overview": "Sue Perkins makes a triumphant return to Channel 5 with an incredible brand-new three-part series. Heading off the beaten track, Sue explores three regions of Thailand, meeting extraordinary people – and animals!First, she heads north to Chiang Mai, kicking off her journey by abseiling from the wonderfully named Crazy Horse Buttress into a limestone cave deep underground. Next, on the island of Phuket she helps to clear detritus from a coral reef: 'litter picking does not get any better than this!' In Bangkok she pops into a Buddhist Hell Garden to explore the potential wages of sin, has a driving lesson on an electric tuk-tuk in a monsoon and picks the world's most aromatic coconut with secateurs 20 feet above her head. Not scary at all.As she travels across Thailand she meets extraordinary animals too. Sue learns to sing lullabies to recovering elephants and discovers the secrets of a gibbon ‘love tunnel'. Throughout this vibrantly colourful and joyful meander through unseen Thailand, Sue Perkins is funny, fresh and empathetic, happily losing herself in Thailand.",
