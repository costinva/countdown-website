  "overview": "6-part documentary series following farmers from all over Ireland over one full farming year. The series brings us into the lives of eleven very different Irish farming families across four seasons of the year. Viewers get to know the men and women who are growing and producing the food we all eat and providing income and employment in our rural communities. The series charts their lives from spring through to winter, how they cope with everything that nature has to throw at them and how they are affected by environmental responsibilities.Â ",
