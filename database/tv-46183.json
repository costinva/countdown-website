  "overview": "Триггер features Artem, a Moscow-based psychologist who practices ‘provocative therapy' – a cure for patients by confronting them with their fears. When a patient apparently commits suicide, Artem is held responsible and is sent to prison. Once free, he starts rebuilding his life by immediately taking on a new case, trying to get his wife back, protecting his sister from her violent boyfriend and attempting to prove who really killed his patient.",
