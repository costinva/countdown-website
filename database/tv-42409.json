  "overview": "In 1961, President Kennedy issued a grand challenge: to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth by the end of the decade. What followed was a series of daring missions against an almost impossible timeline on the most complicated spacecraft ever built. Revisit an era when NASA's team of engineers and astronauts gambled everything to embark on humankind's most ambitious journey, brought to life through archival interviews, rarely seen footage, and artifacts from the vaults of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.",
