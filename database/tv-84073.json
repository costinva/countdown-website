  "overview": "South Africa is a country of incredible beauty, but also a very complicated history. A country of extraordinary contrasts and ethnic diversity. Dawid will visit the largest cities of South Africa, such as Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, will travel along the magnificent coast of the Indian and Atlantic oceans, and will also see mountain passes and game reserves with his own eyes. He will show what the work of a truck driver in this country looks like, but also life in its various corners. South Africa is a unique country - on the one hand modern, on the other developing in many aspects.",
