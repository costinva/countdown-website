  "overview": "A family that shoots an educational show signs a streaming contract, and according to the contract, the characters cannot grow old and die, and must also live in the apartment of elderly parents. Batek, Mom, Grandfather and Grandmother in each episode answer the question that their Son asks them. Once the family considered this show to be a lamp show and enjoyed filming, but now they are sick of everything. They can't break the contract, change something in their lives and stop explaining, so the Explainers decide to sabotage the process and admit to everyone that they are far from an ideal family, so that the producer himself fired them.",
