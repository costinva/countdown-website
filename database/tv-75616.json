  "overview": "An almost functional family flows almost peaceful days by procrastinating on almost important issues. While a stroke strikes Valeria, its central pillar, this Smala realizes that it is not immune to the drama. Under the gaze of little Lucas, intrigued by funny adults who ask themselves funny questions, the group will be forced to ask them more essential - and by the way, to mature.",
