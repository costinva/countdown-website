  "overview": "Some incredible and funny story has happened to each of us at least once in our lives, which means that absolutely anyone can become a participant in the new show of Garik Martirosyan's stories. In each issue, there are 100 people in the hall, half of them are participants, the other half are viewers who will evaluate them. The task of the participants is to tell their two—minute story to Garik and his star guest, and most importantly — to make the audience laugh, which puts up points. Whoever scores the most points will be the winner and will receive a cash prize. At the end of each issue, the star will tell his funny story. If her story turns out to be funnier, according to the audience, then the winner leaves with the money he earned earlier. If the star loses by points, then the winner's winnings increase to 1 million rubles!",
