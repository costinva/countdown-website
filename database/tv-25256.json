  "overview": "Joseph Pinoni, a gambling and womanizing prima donna ex-opera star, returns to California's Napa Valley to help run the family vineyard after he injures his vocal cords. Joseph's feisty mother Marie is not starstruck by her son's notoriety, and can only offer offbeat wisdom. His younger, stressed-out sister Francesca loves Joseph but resents his overshadowing her with his career while she stayed home to toil in the family business. Joseph hopes to improve his relationship with 16-year-old nephew Michael, whose sheltered life he hopes to change. Leo, the gruff vineyard manager, keeps everything humming, while Claude, a wealthy dilettante and self-styled artist, is Joseph's best friend and co-conspirator.",
