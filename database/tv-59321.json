  "overview": "Elena devoted all her time to the family, but neither her husband nor mother appreciated her efforts. And when her younger sister, released from prison, appears in her life, it became even worse. Since childhood, spoiled, not adapted to life and dodgy, Rita decides to finally \"poison\" Elena's life, in every possible way setting her children against her. This turns into another tragedy and aggravates relationships in the family circle so much that the woman decides to commit suicide. It was at this moment that a stranger named Mikhail rescued her and offered a deal - to get a job at the firm of his longtime business rival. Elena agrees, not even knowing how this work will turn out for her.",
