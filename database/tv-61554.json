  "overview": "Around the time the atmosphere in the world is filled with cheer in preparation for Christmas, there are people completely detached from the gaiety with which Christmas Eve is eagerly anticipated. There is a former couple who works at a company that will go into bankruptcy at Christmas; an elementary school boy distressed by his parents who are entering divorce; and kindhearted small-time gangsters who have descended into the underworld business although not by choice. They seek love, get betrayed and have troubles. Even so, they struggle hard in their attempt to take a step out. Will the former couple be able to convey the love they have for each other? Can the boy prevent the divorce of his parents and protect his family? Will the small-time gangsters be able to hold on to love and tread the respectable path? These three groups somehow get entangled in this story with laughter and tears. Will Christmas miracles happen?",
