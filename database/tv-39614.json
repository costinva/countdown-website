  "overview": "Into Alaska introduces Animal Planet audiences to the rangers, biologists, and interns of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge and the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge; two of Alaska's most well-known wildlife refuges located in the southcentral region of the massive state.Throughout the season the team explores the beautiful, diverse landscape; from rivers and forests, to glaciers and mountains; and interact with the unique to spectacular wildlife that can only be found in this region of the country, including black and brown bears, wolves, caribou, ptarmigan, and even lynx. We'll also see these teams work to conserve and protect animals and their habitats and work to control invasive species that are threatening the ecosystem, including Elodea, an aquatic plant species that threatens the Salmon population, and more.",
