  "overview": "Set in 19th century Delhi, our story takes place at a time when technology and science are still in their infancy and modern tools of investigation haven't yet been invented. While Bahadur Shah Zafar II reigns ostensibly, the British might and influence increase each day, and with it, a spate of crimes. As crime multiplies, the police grapple to keep up with the mounting unsolved cases. Under these circumstances, when the Kotwal finds himself in the midst of a felonious mystery, he seeks the help of the only man who can come to his aid, Mirza Jaan Nawaz. Though eccentric in his methods of investigation, Mirza proves himself time and again, unraveling a new mystery with every case. Without the aid of technology, Mirza relies on the most potent tool of all his brains! With an equal measure of intelligence and looks, Mirza Jaan Nawaz knows how to maneuver every situation. But Mirza only has eyes for his love, Zeenat, from whom he often seeks counsel.Â ",
