  "overview": "Based on a series of bestselling novels by award-winning children's author Colin Thiele, Sun on the Stubble tells the story of Bruno Gunther, a 14-year-old boy from a German immigrant family growing up in a small wheat farming community in South Australia during the 1930's. While his father preaches the virtues of hard work on the farm, Bruno manages to find all sorts of opportunities for mischief and adventures as he explores the community around him. Through his adventures, Bruno comes to appreciate and understand more about himself, and about the community of the valley which surrounds and nurtures him. He finally earns the hard won respect of his father, but also faces the prospects of leaving his family, friends and eccentric relatives to pursue his education in the city.",
