After a terrarium that she made captured his attention, Satsuki ends up helping out with a garden project he has undertaken. Before long, the two of them become a couple. Then the gardener Shiraishi Yuma joins the project and Riku is greatly shaken. Satsuki is unaware of their reunion. The feelings of the three of them intertwine as they focus on completing the garden. Satsuki eventually makes a choice.",
