  "overview": "The Kilborn File, a new half-hour program featuring comedian and talk show host Craig Kilborn, will debut this summer for a six-week run. The program, which marks a return to television for Kilborn after a six-year hiatus, will feature the host's humorous and opinionated take on pop culture and current events. Celebrities and human interest guests will join him for signature segments, such as the rapid-fire \"5 Questions\" and a rotating \"Power Panel\" that will weigh-in on the day's big issues, as well as a cavalcade of all-new Kilborn-branded comedy that will debut throughout the series.",
