  "overview": "Encore! brings together former castmates of a high school musical, tasking them with re-creating their original performance in a high school reunion like no other. Emotions run high as the former students face faded friendships, former flames, self-doubt and killer choreography. Through it all, these unlikely groups of friends — with the help of Broadway's best — just might pull off a standing-ovation-worthy performance of beloved musicals.",
