  "overview": "A ten-part series about the life of Jimmy Zámbó. The biographically inspired series follows the rise of the singing legend, which was rife with conflict. While the story does not in the least paint an idealized picture of the star, it takes you back in time and also tells about the impact of the regime change on Hungarian music society. ",
