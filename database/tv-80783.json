  "overview": "They have no special education, but sometimes they act more confidently than experienced psychologists. They make you feel euphoria and delight, and also pain and fear. They hide behind high positions, present diamonds and offer to start a joint business. Relationships with them are exciting, but in the end the \"lovers\" inevitably find out that they were deceived. Four lonely women who fell into the traps of romantic swindlers will tell their stories.",
