  "overview": "Leo Roth is Germany's most successful media lawyer. With her Berlin law firm, she moves just as confidently on the political floor as in the glamor world of the rich and beautiful. For Leo Roth, her work is all about one thing: winning every case. Her goal is to protect the privacy of her prominent and non-prominent clients while guiding public opinion. She wants to prevent fake news and media hunts and protect people from media character assassination through false reporting, shit storms and Twitter avalanches. In the course of the series, the lawyer becomes entangled in a fatal thicket of political and private intrigues.",
