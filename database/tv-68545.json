  "overview": "The Adventures of Bumper and Soos is a story about two inseparable friends and their colorful life. Bumper works as a driver and lives with Vika. He is a realist, and sometimes this complicates his life. He does not understand hints well, but he tries his best. Souss, on the contrary, knows how to fantasize, but bringing his ideas to life is a completely different story. Bold in thought and in constant search for himself, he builds a relationship with Beatrice. But such a creative person cannot be calm: every day, there are new challenges. The dreaminess and adventurism of Soos throws new adventures to friends, and since Bumper will never leave his comrade in trouble, they rake everything together.",
