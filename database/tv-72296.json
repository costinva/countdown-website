  "overview": "Hello Kitty and her twin sister Mimmy love to explore and learn new things, and learning becomes even more fun when you have someone to share it with. So, you can imagine how excited Kitty is when she finds out that her family has new neighbors: the Berry family, who also have twins, Amy and Eric. And they are the same age as Kitty and Mimmy! Also, Amy and Eric also have another friend named Harry, who is very smart. They are three new friends to go on adventures with! They learn all kinds of things, like how to tell time, how to do origami, or just help around the house. There is always something new to discover and do!",
