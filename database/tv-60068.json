  "overview": "Sicily in the 1950s: The sales of the communist daily newspaper \"L'Ora\" have hit rock bottom when Antonio Nicastro takes over the post of editor-in-chief. With him, a breath of fresh air moves in: he resolutely drives his journalists to uncover the crimes of the Cosa Nostra, which are omnipresent in the region around Palermo. In their research, Nistic√≤ and her journalists penetrate every corner of society and the Church. The reaction of Cosa Nostra was not long in coming: a few days after the term \"Mafia\" was specifically used in the newspaper for the first time, on October 19, 1958 there was a bomb attack on the offices of the daily newspaper. The headline of \"L'Ora\" the next day reads: \"The mafia threatens us, the investigation continues\".",
