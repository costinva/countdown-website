  "overview": "Join presenter Nigel Marven as he discovers the colorful and varied wildlife and culture of Central America. Join him as he climbs the ancient Maya ruins of El Mirador, Tikal and Yaxha in northern Guatemala and treks through the humid jungles of the mysterious Darien Gap on Panama's border with Colombia in search of a giant eagle. You can be right on his shoulder as he finds colorful Quetzals in Honduras, frog-eating bats in Panama, feisty reptiles and gets close to lava spewing volcanoes in Guatemala. In the 'Galapagos of the Caribbean' Nigel meets brightly colored poison frogs, a different variety for each island. There are baby Leatherbacks, a close encounter with King Vultures and the world's most beautiful heron to be observed too not to mention a birdwatching President! All this and more as he meets locals and scientists keen to share their beautiful countries and wildlife with him.",
