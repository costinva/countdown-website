  "overview": "Treasure Champs is a preschool mixed media show exploring moral values common to different faiths and cultures. It features two comedic animated characters (Barry and Kari) who explore a different value, or ‘treasure'. A wide range of treasures are explored including Courage, Honesty, Trust – even Democracy and Sacrifice! Each episode also includes a live action retelling of a fable or a story from a faith tradition, plus short films about inspiring children who are living out the treasures in their daily lives. A funny and warm-hearted series for older pre-schoolers and their families.",
