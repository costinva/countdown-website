  "overview": "Dragnet was a syndicated revival of the classic Dragnet (1951) and Dragnet (1967) series, which were based on the 1949 radio drama, all of which starred Jack Webb as LAPD detective Joe Friday. Webb died in 1982, however, and this revival decided not to re-cast his famous character. Instead, the 1989-1990 series, also known as Dragnet: The '90s or The New Dragnet, starred two younger detectives, but kept to the original formula of voice-over narration and sticking to \"just the facts\".",
