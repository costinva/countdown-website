  "overview": "Our Christmas story begins with the engineers Anna-Carin and Vilgot succeeding in creating an artificial black hole. When the black hole escapes and crashes straight into the attic of an old mansion, the years 1920 and 2020 are tied together. Mira who lives in the mansion 2020 and Rakel who lives in the same mansion in 1920 happen to find the hole at the same time and their souls are sucked in and change places. Mira gets to experience in 1920 and Rakel in 2020, but time travel rarely takes place without problems.",
