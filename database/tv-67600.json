  "overview": "The drama tells the warm story of three generations on the road of growth, guarding family, love and happiness. The protagonist of the story is called Zhao Jia Di, a rich young man who originally had a worry-free life because he was dissatisfied with his father's busy work all year round and neglected to care for the family. The separation between the father and son was very deep, and he refused to accept his father. Financial aid, relying on one's own efforts, leads to a precarious life. During school, Zhao Jia Di began to emerge with his business acumen, and his life gradually became clear. What challenges will they partake in through their life's journey?",
