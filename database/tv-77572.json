Claiming that her best friend Vincent was one of dozens critically injured at the Bataclan Theatre, Chris becomes an indispensable resource for the group, working her way into a prominent role in a survivors' association. Though her commitment seems relentless, discrepancies begin to pepper her story – raising serious doubts among the true victims of the tragedy.  ",
