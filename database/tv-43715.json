  "overview": "The 74th NHK Asadora Drama is Junjo Kirari, which means something along the lines of \"pure-hearted Kirari.\" The story is set in Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture in the era around the Second World War. When the story opens in 1928, the heroine, Sakurako, is a very active seven-year-old girl. Indeed, even in the first episode she exhibits her confidence and enthusiasm. But above all else, Sakurako is interested in becoming a jazz pianist, and music features extensively in the plot.",
