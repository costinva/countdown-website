  "overview": "Premiering on New Year's Eve, BBC's first colour action-adventure series, The Borderers, plunges into the violent and feud-ridden 16th-century Anglo-Scottish border. Here, cattle-rustling and simmering tensions ignite into brutal conflict, challenging figures like Ker of Cessford, Warden of the Scottish Middle March, to maintain order amongst clans more loyal to their own kin than the Crown.",
