  "overview": "Each episode of the wildly entertaining series focuses on a competition in a different city from around the world, including London, Des Moines, Dallas, Edmonton, Johannesburg, Madrid and Sao Paolo. Everyday people will transform into daredevil engineers as they battle to be the fastest to the bottom of the nearly half-mile course. No two events are the same – every track presents distinct challenges, from water features to intimidating \"bone rattler\" and \"final kicker\" sections. Teams are judged not only on speed, but also on creativity and showmanship. Winners will take home a trophy along with the ultimate bragging rights.  ",
