  "overview": "Standa Pekárek has three wishes in life: to drive a volga, to drive for the Humour and Folk Entertainment editorial office and to drive Got'ák. The five-part miniseries Volha is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Karel Hynia, written in an extraordinary, bizarre and precisely echoed language. It can be perceived as a peculiar history of Czechoslovak television with a number of incredible, albeit real, \"stories from the set\". At the same time, however, it is a portrait of its main character - a limited egocentric who excels in inventing small tricks and deceptions - how to steal petrol, fake mileage, cheat his wife, get rid of the competition. Logically, he then also becomes a StB collaborator (with the code name Volha) who informs on all his co-workers and passengers without any remorse.",
