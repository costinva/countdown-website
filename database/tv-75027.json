  "overview": "In Restless Dreams is a meeting of two masters of their craft, a deep look into the miracle and wonder of songwriting, and an exploration of a life of singular creativity that has lost none of its curiosity, ambition, and mystery. Gibney and Simon's conversations are enhanced by insights from such friends and creative collaborators as jazz titan Wynton Marsalis, Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, and Simon's wife, singer Edie Brickell.",
