  "overview": "Let's Go, Bananas! focuses on a community of three sweet and silly neighbouring animal families who share each other's triumphs, dramas and completely bananas lives. The show is a feel-good celebration of different family structures, and all the wonderful chaos, joy and messy moments which will be recognised and loved by young viewers and their own families.Â ",
