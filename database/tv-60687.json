  "overview": "\"Alyssa\" is a story about the fragility of growing up, the fear of loneliness and the importance of motherly love and support. Alyssa is only fifteen, and her teachers are tired of calling her mother into school, while Alyssa's mother can't understand what is going on with her child. Alyssa then finally learns what has been hidden from her for years: she will soon go completely blind. A little longer, and she will be in total darkness. She vows to live to the fullest while she can and decides that it would be stupid to waste time on school. It is better to grow up fast, earn some easy money, and move to a big and beautiful city. But pretty soon Alyssa's teenage illusions are shattered by reality, and her mother's strategy of pretending that all is well will inevitably lead to disaster.",
