  "overview": "Throughout history, Alaskans have had to fight for survival. Even now, everything is STILL Tougher in Alaska - the last American frontier. From earning a living to burying the dead, everyday life here has always been shaped by severe weather, rugged terrain and vast distances between communities. The people who call Alaska home have a long history of overcoming adversity and adapting to their extreme environment. Host Geo Beach, who has lived in Alaska for more than 25 years, is on a quest to find out what it really takes to survive and thrive in Alaska.",
