  "overview": "Frannie Escobar is a homemaker whose life is making her crazy. But with laughter, wisdom and plenty of heart, Frannie copes with the ups and downs of everyday life with her cantankerous Cuban husband Joey, his eccentric mother, their dim-witted son, and their headstrong daughter. In a house where the sexes battle, the cultures clash and the generation gap is unbridged, life is lively, unpredictable and always entertaining.",
