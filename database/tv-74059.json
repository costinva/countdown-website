  "overview": "Queue depicts two multi-generational family units that intersect and intertwine in the closed door of various and numerous queues. It is in this context that the two families must come together, unite, free and emancipate themselves, while giving themselves over to us. Grandparents, parents, children, these characters all have a lot on their hearts, but while they take their troubles patiently, advancing slowly, they give us access to a part of themselves. Moments of life sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, which we witness.",
