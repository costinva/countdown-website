  "overview": "An ancient evil is about to be unleashed.Thousands of years ago, the great Child King Tutankhamen ruled. Few know the details of his life - no one knows the secrets of his death. All that is about to change. Free-spirited archaeologist Danny Fremont is certain that if found, King Tut's Emerald Tablet would hold the power to control the world. Unfortunately, the only one who believes Fremont is his nemesis archaeologist Morgan Sinclair, a member of a secret society who wants the tablet to harness unspeakable evil on the world and will stop at nothing to get it. With the help of a crackerjack team that includes the doubting Egyptologist Dr. Barakat, Fremont ventures into the Valley of the Kings, toward Tut's tomb, nearer the portal to another world, and closer to the truth behind a mystery that will change the world forever - or end it.",
