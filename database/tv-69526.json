  "overview": "The corrupt and demagogue Odorico Paragua√ßu is a candidate for mayor of Sucupira and is elected with the slogan \"Vote for a serious man and win a cemetery\". The problem is that no one dies for the work to be inaugurated. The mayor decides to consent to the return of the killer Zeca Diabo to the city, with the guarantee that he will not be arrested. There is the hope that he will kill someone and get him a corpse. The mayor just didn't imagine that Zeca Diabo would return to Sucupira ready to never kill anyone again, because he wants to become a righteous man. Odorico has as allies the Cajazeiras sisters, in love with the colonel, and Dirceu Borboleta, his faithful personal secretary.",
