  "overview": "Deep in the bush of British Columbia there is a new gold rush happening in area known as Devil's Canyon. Hundreds of millions of dollars in gold are waiting for anyone who is willing to risk their life to get it. Extreme prospectors Boyce Goff, Ben van der Valk and John Belchik travel separately into the areas of Devil's Canyon that are far beyond the reach of big mining companies, in search of the next big pay streak. No roads, no trails, no camera crew, no help. It's man vs. nature in one of the harshest environments on Earth, all for the chance to steal the Devil's gold.",
