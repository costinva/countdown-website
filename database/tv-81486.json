  "overview": "Trying to sell their grandfather's house, two friends hailing from \"gilded youth\" become victims of a fraudulent realtor. Two families of migrants fleeing from the war - from Crimea and Donbass - move into the twice-sold house. Completely different mentally, traditionally, and religiously, the families of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians from Donetsk region are forced to coexist and find out who is in charge of the house. How will the problem with the fraud be resolved, will the two different families be able to live together, and will their domestic quarrels amid talk of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine interfere with the emergence and flourishing of love between their children?",
