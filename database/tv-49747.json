  "overview": "Cartoon Network's Monster Beach follows the frightfully funny adventures of surf-siblings Jan and Dean. Enjoying an endless summer vacation, they have a monster good time on the island of Iki-Iki hanging out with their laidback uncle and a bunch of mischievous, thrill-seeking monsters. Together with their new fiendish friends, they cruise around in hopped-up hot-rods, unravel mysteries of a local surf legend and prevent the bad guys from ruining their fun. Monster Beach is much more fun than your typical tropical getaway. After all, life's a real adventure when your friends are misfit monsters.",
