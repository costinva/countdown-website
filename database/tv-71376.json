  "overview": "Enzo Baroni is an antennae from Centocelle who suddenly disappears. When he returns several months later, he has an Indian mundu, a long beard and a seraphic air. Nobody knows what happened to him, not even him, but what is certain is that now everyone is hanging on his lips. In a short time the man attracts the attention of a television agent who sniffs the deal and transforms Enzo from antennae into the \"Santone di Centocelle\", known for all as Oscio.",
