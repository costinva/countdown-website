  "overview": "Brewster the Rooster and his best pal Maggie are both super inquisitive. They wear tap shoes but it's their inimitable style of imagining possible answers to questions that makes them such a good team!Whenever one of them ponders a question like \"If fish live in water, what do they drink?\", Brewster and Maggie hold hands, do a little tap dance and open their imaginations. Through creative thinking, they come up with many possible solutions, always building on each other's ideas. They will take young viewers on a journey of discovery, and delve into a colourful and exciting world to find out the answers to those curious questions.",
