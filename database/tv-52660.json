  "overview": "Mama Róza, the \"Godmother\", is the leader of the smuggling mafia, who, at the beginning of the story, on her 69th birthday, decides to retire within a year and gives control of the smuggler mafia to the mayor of the village, ie Makkosszállás. The election will be due in a year, so the nearby family members and the residents of the village are also starting to work - with more or less success - to get into the graces of Mama Róza and get the chance of getting the mayoral title as much as possible. They use everything. They know no bounds! ",
