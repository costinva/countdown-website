  "overview": "Drive Share is a semi-scripted comedy that borrows the look of HBO's 'Taxi-Cab Confessions,' minus all the depressing stories about crack addiction and child molestation. Each episode follows a few of our Drive Share drivers, as they shuttle people around town as part of this new, 'shared economy.'",
