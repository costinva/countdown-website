  "overview": "\"Major Skovoroda\" is a police comedy with detective elements, centered around the charismatic and unconventional head of the criminal investigation department, Andrii Skovoroda. Assigned to a precinct on the outskirts of Kyiv, he's put in charge of a group of rookie officers who lack field experience. Teaching them how to catch criminals is one thing — but showing them how to deal with people is a whole different challenge, especially for someone like him.Known for his sarcastic humor, philosophical quips, and unpredictable tactics, Skovoroda seems more like a mentor — or even a babysitter — than a tough boss. From generational clashes to unexpected team victories, each episode blends sharp wit, unique investigations, and genuine human stories.This is a series about clashing personalities, team spirit, and breaking the mold of traditional police work.",
