  "overview": "Due to world events over the last twenty years and the decline in government finance; Space exploration has fallen from the media's gaze into the shadows. With the recent launch of the first privately owned space craft to service the international space station; it's time to take a fresh look at the new frontiers of space. What does the immediate future hold? A return to the Moon, manned flights to Mars or Titan, mining the asteroid belt or finding an earth-like planet in the cosmos, these goals could be achieved in decades to come. The explosion of private investment including tourist flights from Virgin Galactic and The Red Bull Stratos have all combined to reshape our goals. Europe and the ESA have shouldered their burden of exploration and now Japan, China and India have all committed to launching probes to the Moon, Mars and beyond!",
