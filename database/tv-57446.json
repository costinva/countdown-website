  "overview": "Andrey Viktorovich Izvorin is a very creative person. He draws comics and publishes them under the pseudonym Hunter, and the rest of the time he teaches history at university and sincerely loves his subject. Izvorin came up with a theory according to which every unsolved crime, including if an innocent person was punished for it, inevitably repeats. The ability to draw and think with pictures, as well as knowledge of history, help him and investigator Anna Rybakova to follow the trail of the most unusual maniacs and solve the most complicated murders.‎",
