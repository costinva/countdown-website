  "overview": "At the turn of the century, due to the reservoir requirements of a water conservancy project, a small riverside town was about to be submerged. The construction of a new city and the relocation of its residents were in full swing. In the summer of 2002, torrential rains poured down on Dongjiang City. A bizarre murder case caught the attention of the police: a dead lover, a husband who disappeared and then reappeared—both \"killer\" and \"victim.\" Through the police's relentless investigation, a long-buried past was finally unearthed. The complexities of human nature had blinded many, but the truth can never be drowned—wherever the eye falls, there is sunlight.",
