  "overview": "Liverpool City Council are selling off derelict houses - for just £1 each. But is this the dream scenario that it appears to be? The houses haven't been touched for 10 years, and the buyers must invest their own cash to renovate them, which is at least £40k. If the work is not completed within 12 months, the council can take the houses back, with no compensation.The Wavertree area is renowned locally for crime, drugs and anti-social behaviour. The newcomers are relying on each other to build a solid community from scratch. This series, filmed over two and a half years, captures the highs and the lows of the people who are gambling their savings to step onto the property ladder and trying to achieve ordinary dreams in extraordinary circumstances.",
