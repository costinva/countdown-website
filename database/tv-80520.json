  "overview": "A More or Less Perfect Union explores the most contentious issues in American history and today through the lens of the U.S. Constitution. The groundbreaking, three-part public television series tells the story of how the Framers put freedom in writing; how amendment after amendment finally spread freedom to all of \"we the people\"; and how we still struggle today to preserve the freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution.Our guide is Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg – a national authority on the Constitution, with 30 years of experience on the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. Throughout the series, experts of all stripes – conservative, progressive, and libertarian – debate key issues of liberty: freedom of religion and press, slavery, civil rights, the 2nd Amendment, separation of powers, and more.",
