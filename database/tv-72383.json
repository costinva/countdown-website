  "overview": "Kitchen Chemistry is fronted by acclaimed chef Heston Blumenthal, who holds three coveted Michelin Stars for his restaurant â€˜The Fat Duck'. Each episode deals with the chemical processes that determine methods of cooking, as well as delving into the notion of \"molecular gastronomy\". Heston experiments with a selection of culinary misnomers, such as does browning meat really seal in flavour? Plus can caviar and chocolate make an unusual but tasty food combination? But can science and food truly mix?",
