  "overview": "They say home is where the heart is but what does yours reveal about you? And can it open the door to true love? Back to Mine is a dating show which dares to let intrepid singletons hunt for a potential partner by rifling through their home before they've even met. One single hopeful gets the chance to snoop around three homes, detecting clues about the owners' habits, personality and interests in order to choose one to invite on a date. But then the tables turn when their chosen match gets to look around their home to decide whether to accept the date or stand them up. Does the home hold the key to true love?",
