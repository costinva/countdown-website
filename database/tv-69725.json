  "overview": "The protagonists are apparently normal women who in reality hide burning passions and harbor resentments that will lead them to become brutal murderers. Driven by the most disparate motives, each of them carries within them the signs of a wound that has not completely healed, of an unresolved trauma that has its roots in the past. Their desperate rebellion turns out to be a destructive and self-destructive liberation that condemns them to transform their dreams of happiness into bloody nightmares for themselves, for the men they love and for the other women who are the source of their torment.",
