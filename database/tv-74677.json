  "overview": "Jack Wright is a powerful and successful businessman, who leaves his family in disarray when they learn of his suicide. When the provisions of Jack's final will and testament are made known, his third wife, Sally, and two sons, Gray and John, are shocked to discover they have been largely cut out of Jack's enormous fortune. As DCI Morgan and DC Jones delve further into the case, they realise Jack's cause of death was in fact murder. Their sights turn to the Wright family, where the mother of all feuds is beginning. As each family member becomes more reckless and desperate in their bid to own a piece of Jack's legacy, dark secrets and resentments are revealed with explosive consequences.Â ",
