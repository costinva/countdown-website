And the plague she encounters is much more formidable...While we have learned to live with the seasonal variants of covid, we discover in this southern city a new variant of the plague bacillus called YP2.For lack of treatment, the central government will decide, in order to spare the rest of the country, to close the city - and then apply a mysterious \"Plan D\" of which we will gradually discover the monstrous springs.Based on the work of Albert Camus.",
