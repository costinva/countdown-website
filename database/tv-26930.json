  "overview": "From his home base deep in central Florida, webmaster Derek Barnes was content running FreakyLinks.com, an underground website devoted to debunking paranormal mysteries, along with partner Jason Tatum and webmaster Lan Williams, until the day when images of his long-deceased twin brother Adam -- showing him still alive -- showed up in his e-mail. Now following the trail to uncover this seemingly impossible occurrence, Derek, together with his brother's ex-fiancee Chloe Tanner, finds himself immersed in a subculture of the strange and unusual. In their search for answers, they come across Vince Elsing, a patient in a psychiatric hospital who could be the key to unraveling the mystery.",
