  "overview": "Two-part documentary exploring the 1968 case in which three women were killed after a night of dancing, triggering Scotland's largest manhunt. The suspect's now-infamous moniker, Bible John, came after a key witness described a man who picked up women, yet quoted extensively from the Old Testament and frowned on adultery. Despite one of the biggest manhunts in Scottish history, these brutal killings remain unsolved more than 50 years on.Â ",
