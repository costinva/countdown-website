  "overview": "The Time Hotel is a hotel survival survival where 10 guests try to survive as the last one in the 'Time Hotel', where you can buy everything with time instead of money, and check out as soon as you run out of time. In 'Time Hotel', you can use everything from restaurants to cafes and room service by paying for time instead of money. Prize money up to 300 million won will be given to the final winner, who succeeds in managing time until the end by using the prize money earned through the game. From alliances to lies, betrayals, and conspiracies, it seems that we can get a glimpse of the colorful human group through the appearances of those who carry out their own survival strategies.",
