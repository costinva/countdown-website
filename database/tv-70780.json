  "overview": "In 1988, Scott Johnson, a gay American mathematician, was found dead beneath a cliff in Sydney, Australia. Steve Johnson, Scott's brother, would spend the next 35 years trying to solve the mystery of Scott's death. He could have never imagined the tinderbox he would crack open - a wave of anti-gay violence, homophobia, and fear that cast a shadow for decades. Never Let Him Go delves into Scott Johnson's extraordinary life and mysterious death, and Steve's dogged, multi-decade quest for justice.Â ",
