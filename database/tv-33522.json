  "overview": "The Eyeslicer is a mind-melting new variety TV show designed to slice, dice then mince your eyeballs into a delicious ceviche. Each episode of the show's ten hour first season is a handcrafted mixtape that blends boundary-pushing short-form work into a weird, wild, uninterrupted whole.From vérité documentary to amateur computer animation; surreal horror to remix video art; haunted high school yearbooks to Sasquatch birth rituals; time traveling cats to live web streams of your own birth -- if it sounds too strange for Netflix, chances are you'll see it on The Eyeslicer.",
