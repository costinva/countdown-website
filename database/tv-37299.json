  "overview": "Lee Soo-jung is a travel agent who is seeking her good luck in Bali after a harsh and unforgiving childhood. She meets Jae-min, Kang In-wook, and Young-joo in Bali, three seemingly perfect people entangled in a triangle of love. When Lee Soo-jung finds herself back in Seoul, her desire for success leads her to seek Jae-min for a job, unwittingly setting off a course of events that further complicate the love triangle.What Happened in Bali is a drama that reveals the inner materialistic desires of people. It reflects upon the sometimes ugly (but truthful) side of man where nothing matters more than money.",
