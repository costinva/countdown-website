  "overview": "Each participant in this game will have to go through the wall. Having successfully fit into the silhouette carved in the wall, the player receives points. The participant who does not fit in is hit on the head by the wall and thrown into the pool. We ask those who are nervous not to leave: the wall is foam, the pool is heated. The creators of the project guarantee that not a single player will suffer as a result of participating in the new Channel One show!",
