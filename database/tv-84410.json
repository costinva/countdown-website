  "overview": "New competition show in which twelve celebrity candidates compete in each programme, all of whom have something special in common, e.g. a TV format, a profession or a passion. Although they are united as a group, they will duel one-to-one in two rounds. In the final, the three best will compete against each other, with the winner receiving prize money totalling 100,000 euros. Elton presents the programme, with Frank Buschmann on the commentary microphone.",
