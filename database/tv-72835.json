After moving in, a cheeky ginger cat is discovered in the depths of the home, who is sure that the living space belongs to him. The Myagkovs try to get rid of him, but he always comes back. Once again trying to catch the cat, the father of the family, Mikhail, steps on a bare cable and receives an electric shock, just like his furry opponent. Now the man hears what the cat is thinking about, and, falling under its influence, decides to keep the animal in the family. The Myagkovs' life will never be the same again.",
