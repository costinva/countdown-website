  "overview": "When Senior Detective Lisa Milani requested a desk job in a small town outside of Rome, it was to allow her spend more time with family. But after she's called on to assist with a major case, her extreme competence causes her to end up in charge of an entire investigative squad in the big city. Now she must report to investigating magistrates and demanding superiors, solve cases involving serial killers and other deadly criminals, and at the same time juggle her family life - including dealing with a serious crisis in her marriage. Through it all, she never loses her good humor or her ability to be a good mother.",
