  "overview": "Who Killed Malcolm X? investigates the disturbing mysteries surrounding the assassination of one of the most dynamic American leaders of all time. More than 50 years later, there are still serious questions about who is responsible for what happened on February 21, 1965, when Malcolm X was murdered in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom in front of hundreds of witnesses. Compelling evidence suggests that two of the three men convicted of the crime – both of whom served twenty years in jail – were innocent. More surprising, perhaps, is the fact that evidence pointing to the identities of four other men involved in the plot has been available to law enforcement for decades, but no one has actively pursued the truth… until now. ",
