  "overview": "Rio de Janeiro, late 1970s. A new agent starts working at the Ilha Grande prison, at the same time that a convict arrives at the institution on the coast of Rio. This is a time of effervescence for relationships within prison. Inspired by real events from the last 40 years, the story delves into the emergence of drug trafficking factions, based on events between the \"Falange Jacaré\" and \"Turma do Fundão\" wings of the prison. What happens inside has repercussions on the lives of Padre Nosso, Parada Geral and Morro da Promessa, communities inspired by real favelas.",
