  "overview": "90 Day: The Last Resort couples have reached their breaking points. In a final attempt to salvage their relationships, each couple will participate in a couples retreat to determine whether or not they can heal old wounds. Alongside a team of professionals, they'll actively navigate issues with trust, sex, jealousy, anger, and intimacy. Explosive group therapies, intense couples' sessions, past life regressions, unique on-and-off-resort activities, and so much more ensue. At the end of the retreat, each couple must decide if they will stay together or move on, separately.",
