  "overview": "Winning the lottery is the ultimate dream come true. Everybody fantasizes about winning the big prize and living life without a worry in the world. It comes with all sorts of boons: a private jet, trips around the world, and your own soccer team. The problem is that there is the fantasy, and then there is reality, and \"nary the twain shall meet.\" Actually, most lottery winners lose all their money within just a few years of when they first won it. Some of them become addicts – to gambling or drugs. Some get tangled up in the gray market, while some get into all sorts of fights with their families. The actual winners talk about a radical shift in their lives – one that is too much for them to handle. They say they would rather go back to the way things were, before they won all that money.",
