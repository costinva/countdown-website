  "overview": "This longtime ESPN staple doesn't air in prime time anymore, and the original tag team of Chris Berman and Tom Jackson are no longer involved. But it lives on, albeit in a slightly different form, with host Trey Wingo presenting a shorter-form highlights package of Sunday's NFL action coupled with more in-depth analysis from former players Merril Hoge and Tim Hasselbeck.",
