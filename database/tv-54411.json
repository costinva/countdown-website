  "overview": "Pop Ràpid revolves around the stories of Fede and Albert, the components of The Frederics. After failing time and time again, they continue to try to make a place for themselves in the Catalan music scene, at all costs, whether it is to seduce a music critic, to swindle a producer or to record a \"reggaeton\" song. This time they will have the help of Alfons, an extremely shy fellow-rapper, who doesn't quite understand the jobs that force him to do. They continue to be installed in the Estraperlo, the concert hall where a peculiar gallery of \"moderns\" trapped in the night world and appearances parade, seeking to find their way under the perplexed and ironic gaze of Toni, the waiter, confessor and our accomplice in this sour and original \"sitcom\" full of humor and musical performances.",
