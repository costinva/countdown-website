  "overview": "18-year-old Kira, trying to save her family from eviction from the apartment, comes up with a scam, which she herself becomes a victim of. At the IVF clinic, she is given an embryo of a wealthy childless married couple intended for their surrogate mother. Kira's plan was to blame the clinic for the mistake and get the money, but now she faces a dilemma — to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy? But then she would deprive people of the last chance to have a long-awaited child. Or give birth? It means saying goodbye to your usual life, your dream of becoming an artist and freedom, which means so much to Kira. The girl's greedy mother sees her pregnancy as an excellent source of income, and the rich couple seeks to control Kira in everything and imposes their terms of the \"contract\".",
