  "overview": "Two awkward men in their mid-50s, trumpeter Torben  and saxophonist Peter, are unceremoniously fired by the leader of their dance band Boarding Time. What now? At a jam session someone comes up with an idea: Peter and Torben should go to Mallorca and become Schlager stars in El Arenal. The road to stardom is however paved with complications like song theft, holiday romance and Torben's suspicious wife Ilona.",
