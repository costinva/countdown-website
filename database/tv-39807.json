  "overview": "Beat the Chef sees amateur cooks go head to head against a professional chef in fast-paced cook offs to win a Â£10,000 cash prize. The four house chefs to beat are Michelin starred Mark Sargeant, Celebrity chef Clodagh Mckenna, award winning chef James Tanner and Roux Scholar Frederick Forster.Each round sees passionate home cooks battling to win over members of a tasting jury who will blind taste the dishes. It's a gastronomic gamble - if they cook well, they'll climb up the money ladder, but lose, and they walk away with nothing.",
