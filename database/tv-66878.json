  "overview": "Yao Wei is a female director in a company. Being a workaholic, she's so focused on KPI's that she doesn't realize her relationship with her husband has become estranged. Many women in her department also face gender-specific challenges. At this time, Yao Wei learns that she's pregnant. Yao Wei has always wanted a child but she has become pregnant at a stage of her life when her career is on the rise. Meanwhile, Yao Wei's boss Ding Lan has recruited a rival into the company. New director An Chang is not only qualified, she also has her husband's support. They have a DINK (dual income no kids) household which seems to be the perfect way to avoid the problems plaguing many women in the workplace. After some deliberation, Yao Wei chooses to give birth, and it is this decision that changes everything. In her personal life, Yao Wei and her husband regain their feelings and trust in each other. At work, she joins hands with her \"rival\" to help out their fellow female colleagues. Through the lady's character they constantly exhibit, Yao Wei begins to understand that happiness in life can be measured in different ways from success in one's career to becoming a mother. The company leaders also gradually understand that pursuit of profits is not everything since it's also important to let employees grow and gain satisfaction and happiness in work and life.",
