  "overview": "Keep It Spotless features kids competing in a variety of physical and paint-filled challenges designed with one goal in mindâ€“to stay as clean as possible. After each game, a 360 degree scanner will measure each teams' mess to determine just how spotless they really are. Then, the winning team will face The Gauntlet, a multiple-challenge obstacle course, where they can turn their cleanliness into cold hard cash.",
