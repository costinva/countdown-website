  "overview": "The Last Woodsmen takes us deep into the secluded wilderness with these courageous and highly skilled loggers as they literally risk their lives. It's a rarely explored, dangerous business which translates to incredibly engrossing television.On a floating barge hundreds of miles from civilization, veteran logger Jared Douglas puts everything on the line to harvest the largest timber in the world. One misstep in this high-risk industry could cost tens of thousands of dollars, or even a life. Joining him at the edge of the world is a tight-knit crew of lumbermen who, with only axes and hand-held power saws, take down massive, highly valuable trees that can be worth up to $70K each.",
