  "overview": "Five years ago, schoolgirl Andie Bell was murdered by Sal Singh. Case closed. The police know he did it. Everyone in town knows he did it. But Pippa Fitz-Amobi - our insatiably smart, slightly square heroine - isn't so sure and she's determined to prove it. But if Sal Singh isn't a murderer and the real killer is still out there, how far will they go to keep Pippa from the truth?",
