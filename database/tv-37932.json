  "overview": "A comedy series packed with action and adventure, the show centres on a ‘Viking Skool' that trains the very best to be future Viking leaders. Ylva, Erik and Arni are three friends brought together at the ‘skool', although for them becoming a Viking is a long shot! Bound together by their outlier status, their friendship grows as they meet various challenges. The three unlikely heroes show what a true Viking heart and soul looks like and that bravery, while not easy, is necessary. And that loyalty is important, but honesty more so, and that friendship is the glue that gets us through life!",
