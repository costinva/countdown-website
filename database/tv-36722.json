  "overview": "Our biggest state harbors some America's deadliest animal killers. When winter breaks, carnivores emerge on Alaska's waterways and wide open spaces to make the most of the endless sunshine. Its shores of open ocean create a path for giant hunters like orcas, great white sharks and walrus. Bears reap the benefits of brutal ocean kills along the coastline and waterways. Inland, wolves chase prey with ferocious intensity. Alaska's Deadliest thrive in one of America's last wild frontiers.",
