  "overview": "When Peppi (36) finds out he wasn't invited to the class reunion, his self-image starts to crack. Fuck! Forgotten? Uninvited? – This must be a mistake! Searching for answers, we follow Peppi to his old hometown and back to the past of his 16-year-old self: Skateboarding with bleached tips through the monsoon of the 2000s. The era of flip phones, lan parties, and Top of the Pops. But alongside the wild, nostalgic memories lurk some dark teenage sins. Maybe there are reasons why Peppi shouldn't have been invited after all. CHABOS is like an old Facebook profile you've scrolled too far down — full of shame.",
