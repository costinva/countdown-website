  "overview": "In April 1975, six young German terrorists stormed the West German embassy in Stockholm. A dramatic hostage crisis unfolded, with deadly consequences. For twelve tense hours, the world watched as Stockholm police and Olof Palme's government tried to resolve the situation — a life-and-death negotiation ending in catastrophe. The documentary offers unique insights through unheard testimonies from hostages, police, and relatives.",
