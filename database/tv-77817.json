  "overview": "A bold experiment from the TNT channel, in which magicians, mediums, parapsychologists, psychics and other people with extraordinary abilities will try to prove that magic exists. 13 heroes of the project will gather in the most mystical city of Russia - St. Petersburg, to unravel the famous mysteries of the past, touch centuries-old legends and help celebrities who find themselves in paranormal and mystical situations. Our team of superheroes, using their unusual talents, will work together to unravel the most unexpected and mysterious stories. And all in order to, together with the viewer, test reality for strength and separate fantasies from incredible reality, expose some myths and confirm others. During the project, the heroes live together, and this will help both the viewer and the participants to immerse themselves as deeply as possible into the otherworldly world, not only in completing tasks, but also in unpacking themselves. At the end of the project, the winner will receive a cash prize.",
