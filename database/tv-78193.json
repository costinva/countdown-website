  "overview": "EastEnders is working on a new storyline that will see Anna Knight (Molly Rainford) get her drink spiked. Anna is set to find herself in danger later this summer when she gets spiked whilst on a night out at Peggy's. With her friends believing that Anna's behaviour is down to alcohol, the incident initially goes unnoticed, but Anna's friends soon become concerned for her welfare when they realise that her behaviour does not equate to the little amount of alcohol she has actually consumed…In a digital first for EastEnders, an exclusive five part mini-series will be made accessible to viewers via a QR code that will feature within the main episode which will take the audience to a link giving them the option of which platform to watch through. The digital series will offer a unique insight as viewers see the incident from Anna's own perspective, and from the perspective of her friends.As Anna grapples with her detachment from reality, viewers of the mini-series will experience the internal warning signs to look out for when spiked, whereas additional footage captured by Anna's friends will showcase the outward effects the drugs have on her behaviour and mobility. ",
