  "overview": "An unknown virus turns Moscow into a city of the dead. There is no electricity, money has lost all value and those who are still not infected, are desperately fighting for food and fuel. Sergei lives outside the city with the woman he loves and her autistic son. It's still safe there. In spite of that he rushes to Moscow to save his ex-wife and their son. These people, who never believed they'd be under the same roof again, have to put the past behind them and set off on a long, dangerous journey north.",
