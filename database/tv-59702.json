  "overview": "From whiz kid, to convict, to pastor, to fraud fighter, to convict yet again, Barry Minkow has become the master of self reinvention - just ask the countless individuals who fell victim to him over the years. KING OF THE CON gives true crime fans the ultimate look at how a scam artist can reinvent himself and get rich - many times over - by featuring one of the first interviews with Minkow discussing his life and crimes.",
