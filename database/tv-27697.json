  "overview": "Face Value is a groundbreaking new game show that will finally answer the age-old question, \"Can you judge a book by its cover?\" The veteran actress, comedienne and LGBT advocate knows what it's like to be prejudged, so this series is flipping the script to award cash and prizes for correctly guessing facts about strangers from all walks of life â€“ based solely on their appearance and a few personal details. Hosted by Deon Cole (\"black- ish,\"Barbershop), Face Value will humorously break down stereotypes, expose prejudices, and celebrate the human spirit by highlighting the commonalities and differences among people of various backgrounds, races, religions, beliefs and life experiences.",
