  "overview": "Rob Rinder's Interrogation Secrets takes a unique look at the battle of wits between police and suspects in some of the most disturbing US and UK criminal cases of recent years. Criminal barrister and television personality, Robert Rinder, and a team of experts analyse police interviews. In each of these, the skilled work of detectives was key to cracking the case and securing a conviction.With Rob as the expert guide, retired senior detectives from the U.S. and the UK, forensic and criminal psychologists, and body language experts examine the original police footage of interrogations at the heart of each case, to reveal the 'tricks of the trade' used to extract a confession and the tell-tale signs that a suspect is lying.",
