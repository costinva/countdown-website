  "overview": "In May 1981, truck driver Peter Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering thirteen women and attempting to kill seven others. His trial concluded the biggest manhunt in British criminal history, for a killer nicknamed \"The Yorkshire Ripper\". But after an intense six year search, Sutcliffe was only caught when stopped for a minor motoring offence. And it transpired that he'd in fact already been questioned nine times during the investigation.The series re-investigate this infamous case from a wholly new perspective, asking whether prevailing attitudes of the time, towards women and prostitutes in particular, influenced the investigation and meant that Peter Sutcliffe was caught years too late.",
