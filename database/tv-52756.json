  "overview": "Each and everyone of us has always wondered who are our heroes when we were younger. Well now there is a very own show on our very own daily heroes such as a fire fighter, an operator or even a zoo keeper. Meet Eubie, Wayne, Twinkle, Kip, and Fran as they go out in life and try and become a Higglytown Hero. Becoming a Higglytown Hero takes a lot of work by showing great work to your community such as cleaning up leaves, picking up trash and other things too. Higglytown Heroes is for pre-school audiences and will be sure to get your son or daughter up and try and making a better life for themselves.Â ",
