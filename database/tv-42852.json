  "overview": "Faith Howells, a fun-loving lawyer with a happy marriage and three children, enjoying an extended maternity leave from the law firm she founded with her husband, Evan. Then one day, Evan leaves for work but never arrives. Faith scrambles to handle the clients Evan left behind, all while trying to find out what happened to her husband. As the days go by with no sign of him, Faith becomes the police's prime suspect, and her search for the truth leads her to the criminal underbelly of her quiet Welsh town. When long-buried family secrets come to light, Faith wonders if she ever really knew her husband at all.Scenes for Un Bore Mercher and Keeping Faith were filmed back to back, one in Welsh and one in English, but a few instances of cast and crew members being used differently between each language, as well as Keeping Faith running 10 minutes longer, have led us to split the show into two entries.",
