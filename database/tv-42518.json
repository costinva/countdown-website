  "overview": "Hosted by former federal prosecutor and on-air legal analyst Laura Coates, the series re-explores the infamous murder of Martha Moxley by taking a 360-degree look at the case's original evidence, testing new theories that examine potentially overlooked clues with help from some of the world's preeminent crime experts. Through new and exclusive interviews with those connected to the case, including former LAPD Homicide Detective Mark Fuhrman, trial defense attorney Mickey Sherman and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as conversations with Martha's loved ones, Coates revisits the investigation and its aftermath in an attempt to understand the question that remains: Why has justice been so elusive for the Moxley family after so many years?",
