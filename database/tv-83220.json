  "overview": "Western Algarve, 1943. In the midst of World War II, Portugal declares neutrality, but in the isolated village of Aljezur, the reality is different. German air raids on Allied ships off the coast spread fear among the population, still marked by a history of witchcraft. Celeste, a young orphan from a heretical family, is accused of being the heir to this evil that caused so many past tragedies. Betrayed and expelled from the village, she sets out in search of the truth about her parents' death, her identity and revenge against those who condemned her. Meanwhile, the growing Nazi presence in the region hides dark secrets. A story of mystery, superstition and resistance to oppression, which questions the very malleable nature of truth.",
