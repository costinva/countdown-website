  "overview": "One of the greatest manhunts in New York City history comes to life in this gripping three-part series. Conversations with a Killer: The Son of Sam Tapes takes viewers inside the NYPD's desperate race to catch the infamous .44-caliber killerâ€”and into the disturbing mind of David Berkowitz himself. Newly unearthed recordings offer rare insight into his twisted psyche, revealing what was going through his mind as he unleashed a reign of terror in the late 1970s. Alongside firsthand accounts from cops, journalists, and survivors, the series unpacks how fear spread through the streets, fueled by cryptic letters, a frenzied press, and a killer who seemed to be everywhere and nowhere at once. From Emmy-winning and Academy Award nominated director Joe Berlinger, this chilling new chapter of Conversations with a Killer delves into one of the most infamous cases in American history.",
