  "overview": "The 1970s ushered in a travel revolution – suddenly Britain was saying ‘adios' to wet weekends by the sea, and jetting off to package destinations on the Costas that weren't even built yet! This two-part series takes a step back in time to when all of this was thrillingly new – when sangria, pesetas and siestas became part of our vocab; when holiday brochures dominated our doormats; and holiday programmes took over the airways.We take modern holiday makers on a trip down memory lane, in a recreated high street travel agency, and aboard an authentic 1970s plane. We uncover a secret history of backrooms deals with dictatorships that helped finance our favourite resorts, as well as holiday deals and food options that you wouldn't get nowadays. From mass travel to hippy trail wanderlust, this show takes us back to the decade that started it all.",
