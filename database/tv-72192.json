  "overview": "The series is based on real events of the winter of 1941. Food supplies have dried up and supplies have been blocked. The besieged city was dying of hunger: employees, dependents and children were given 125 grams of bread per day. It was then that a gang appeared in Leningrad, engaged in fraud and robbery. The criminals were mainly involved in counterfeiting food cards.",
