  "overview": "Kolya Videnin, who dreams of becoming a film director, works in an unremarkable video salon - he shows the audience iconic tapes that he managed to memorize. One day, Kolya accidentally shows an adult film to schoolchildren. The guy is arrested and sent to work at a sawmill for child molestation. In the colony, the poor guy gets the nickname Vidik and comes up with a trap plan. To get out on parole as soon as possible, Kolya entertains the prison governor in an unusual way: he makes author's versions of famous movies with the help of available materials — a simple camera and colleagues on correctional days.",
