Chen Jun said modestly that he only wanted to be an ordinary person! Pandora, the 1.2 meter female general of the empire, Lin Xue, the elder sister of the Ability Bureau, and Sandora, the co-ruling queen of the empire, all said no. Even Chen Jun's childhood sweetheart Xu Qianqian, an energetic girl, said that she can't be the emperor~ Chen Jun has no choice but embarks on a busy life of saving the world from Monday to Friday, and playing games on Saturdays and Sundays.",
