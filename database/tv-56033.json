  "overview": "Five men and five women with too much beauty and too little responsibility together on a paradisiacal beach share the chance to take a prize even more attractive than them, in what may be the biggest challenge of their lives: half million reais, but only if they manage to control their desires. The rules are set by the bossy virtual assistant Lana: for each infraction (even a little kiss) an amount of money is deducted from the total prize. With sex out of the game, will they be able to create deeper connections?In addition to Lana's tight pressure, the comedian Bruna Louise comments the show with a mocking analysis of our guests.",
