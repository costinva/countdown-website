  "overview": "Daddy Issues follows Gemma, who lives for the weekend when she can get blasted and party hard in Stockport, Manchester. But after joining the mile high club with a random hook-up on her way back from a holiday to Portugal, she's pregnant, and it couldn't come at a worse time.The only person Gemma has left in her life is her dad Malcolm, who is kind hearted but useless â€“ he can't load a washing machine, boil an egg or change the Wi-Fi password. Malcolm is suffering from the collapse of his family and living in a bedsit for divorced men.Which is how Gemma and her dad end up living in Gemma's flat. She needs support at a critical time in a woman's life, he needs help microwaving rice without it exploding.",
