  "overview": "A four-part docuseries that tells the little-known true story of Beulah Mae Donald, a Black mother in Alabama, who took down the Ku Klux Klan after the brutal murder and lynching of her son, Michael Donald. He was just nineteen years old when he was found dead, hanging from a tree in Mobile, on March 21, 1981. The local Black community immediately suspected it was a Klan lynching, but local law enforcement was slow to acknowledge that the murder was racially motivated. Beulah Mae and local Black leaders refused to back down until Michael's killers and the hateful organization they belonged to were brought to justice.",
