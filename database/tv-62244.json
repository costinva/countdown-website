  "overview": "Darcey Bussell's Royal Roadtrip will see the Royal Ballet star follow in the footsteps of the Queen as she sets out on a regal adventure across the magnificent landscapes of Britain and visits a raft of breathtaking locations that have shaped our monarch's identity.There's barely an inch of the country the Queen hasn't visited during her 70 years on the throne and now Darcey, who received her Damehood from the Queen in 2018 and danced for her on multiple occasions, wants to visit some of the locations where the monarch left a lasting impression.",
