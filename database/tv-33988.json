  "overview": "Sando is Australia's queen of the discount furniture package deal. She's built her empire on being a down-to-earth larrikin and is something of a national treasure - to all but her family. They banished her a decade ago when her one-night stand (and resulting pregnancy) by her daughter's fiancé was shockingly revealed at his wedding to her daughter. Now, after a health scare, her career on a precipice and her professional nemesis primed to push her into the abyss, Sando is determined to rekindle the family relationship. She needs them, and in spite of their initial apprehension… and unbridled hatred… soon they'll discover they might actually need her too.",
