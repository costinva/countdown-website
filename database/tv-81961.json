  "overview": "In the six-part series Breaking Beyond, six breakers discover the dance, breaking and hip hop culture in different cities around the world. In every episode, we follow each breaker as a host in a big metropole in their home countries, and learn about their lives and background stories. Every B-Boy and B-Girl's story is unique, and the contrasts between them show us how diverse the global breaking culture is. In the destination cities, the breakers are divided into hosts and guests, where one will take on the other and show them their culture, lifestyle and country. They will take a deep dive into the city's hip hop culture with a strong focus on break dancing.Â ",
