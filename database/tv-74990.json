  "overview": "Curfew is set in a society where all men live under ‘The Women's Safety Act', meaning they are bound by a strict curfew from 7PM to 7AM every night, with their movements tracked by an ankle tag 24 hours a day. When a woman's body is discovered, brutally murdered during curfew hours and left on the steps of the Women's Safety Centre, veteran Police officer Pamela Green believes that a man is responsible. But in a world where men are bound by the curfew system, her theory is rejected.",
