It does not always understand our colleagues, hardly tolerates the bosses as wayward Zhelvis often violate the chain of command. He everyone speaks only the truth, even unpleasant, but to kick Jelisa impossible to know everything, he is the best in the business! And he always has his own version of what happened...
