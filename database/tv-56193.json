  "overview": "Before leaving her town of Polvaredas de la Sierra to study, Inma wants to fulfill her and her mothers' dream, which is none other than to become the Queen of the festivities. To achieve this, he will rely on his best friends: Estefi, an activist for everything; Javi, who never says no to anything; and Nicole, a disgraced influencer. Opposing Inma will be Zaida, daughter of the chief of the town and therefore a favorite of the crown. It won't be a pretty war, it won't be a fair war, but it will be an epic war. During the competition, Inma will learn that in life travel companions are more important than destiny and that misdirected ambition can leave you completely alone.Â ",
