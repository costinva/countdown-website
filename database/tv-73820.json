  "overview": "A young female stockbroker breaking barriers on Wall Street in the 1960s; an innovative caterer from a farmhouse in Connecticut; a female self-made billionaire and media mogul; and an Alderson Federal Prison Camp inmate – these and more are The Many Lives of Martha Stewart. The new CNN Original Series The Many Lives of Martha Stewart traces Stewart's explosive rise to success, her staggering fall from grace, and her momentous comeback to the limelight, establishing herself as one of the country's most fabled figures. Her brand became one of the most profitable, yet polarizing, in the world – and that was before she was investigated for insider trading. Weaving together never-before-seen images from Stewart's past, rich archival footage including from Stewart's numerous sit-downs on CNN's Larry King Live, and exclusive interviews with Stewart's former employees, colleagues, fellow inmates, and closest confidantes, this illuminating series pulls back the curtain to reveal the woman behind the legendary lifestyle icon.",
