  "overview": "The participants of the TV program are pairs of dancers from leading theaters of Russia. Each of the duets participating in the TV show \"Bolshoi Ballet\" must demonstrate all their skills, because only the most talented performers will become the winners of the Grand Prix of the competition. The audience can also influence the fate of their favorite artists: the audience sympathy prize is awarded based on the results of online voting. During the competition, leading choreographers and ballet masters work with young ballet dancers for several months. The performance of the contestants is assessed by members of the jury, which includes stars of world ballet.",
