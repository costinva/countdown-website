  "overview": "Barbershop, based on the successful feature films. Most of the characters from the popular \"Barbershop\" movies have been retained, headed by Calvin, the reluctant hero and neighborhood confessor who runs the barbershop he inherited from his father. A few new memorable characters have also been added to the world. The continuing comical exploits of these people will be explored along with contemporary issues facing them, set against the slowly gentrifying backdrop of this fictional Chicago neighborhood.",
