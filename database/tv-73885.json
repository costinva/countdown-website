  "overview": "Short, cute and impossibly evil. A delightful comedy, packed with high doses of evil. The Imp is a light-hearted look at trying to square a career spreading the evil -with the mundane demands of the domestic life. The Imp has got the evil self-help guides, the fancy plans, and phobias too numerous to mention. The Imp is evil. He's just not very good at it.",
