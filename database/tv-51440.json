  "overview": "In the center of the plot of \"Ivanko\" are the friendly relations of three women: a modest English teacher and a psychologist Valya, a dance teacher and a broken toastmaster Nastya and a biology teacher Yaroslava. The heroines are just over 30, and it seems to each of them that the problems of a friend are much more serious than her own. On the one hand, the desire to help at all costs and teach everyone about life looks comical, on the other hand, this intervention helps to understand that they are actually unhappy, and it's time to deal with this. But this path is not so simple. In the pursuit of happiness, friends constantly stumble, step on the same rake, exacerbating the already piled problems with their personal lives, work, and parents. ",
