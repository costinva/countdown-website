  "overview": "Building Giants showcases how key technological innovations enable giant superstructures to be built. Footage filmed during construction along with CGI reveal the building process with astonishing detail. The premiere episode charts the creation of the new 71,000 seat Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The 1.4-billion-dollar stadium is being hailed as an architectural wonder because of its eight-petal retractable roof. Other episodes include a look at a massive new cruise ship that can hold more than 7,000 passengers and crew members; a new flood barrier in Venice designed to prevent the precarious ancient city from sinking into the ocean; an ambitious circular subway system that will run directly underneath the historic city center of Copenhagen; and the world's longest suspension bridge ever built in the Arctic Circle.",
