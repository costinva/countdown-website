  "overview": "Behind Bars: Women Inside is an intimate and in-depth look at what it's like to be a woman incarcerated in an American jail. With some 200 inmates, the series goes behind the walls of the Western Massachusetts Regional Women's Correctional Center and explores the reality of life when orange really is the new black. These mothers, daughters, grandmothers and sisters re also gangbangers, murderers, drug smugglers and armed robbers. While we might see glimpses of their softer sides, these often volatile and dangerous women are housed together 24/7 - with explosive consequences.",
