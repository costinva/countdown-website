  "overview": "Porterhouse Blue is a Channel 4 drama based on the novel by Tom Sharpe. It tells the story of Skullion, the Head Porter of a fictional Cambridge college, Porterhouse.For more than 500 years, Porterhouse College has cherished tradition above all else. Unfortunately, its traditions mostly involve decadent banquets, drunkenness, and undistinguished scholarship. Enter Sir Godber Evans, a new master hell-bent on reform. Of course, the dinosaurs on the faculty resist him at every turn. But Head Porter Skullion emerges as Sir Godber's most formidable foe, a self-appointed guardian of Porterhouse's most hallowed traditions, with plenty of tricks up his tweedy sleeve.",
