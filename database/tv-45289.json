  "overview": "Dansken &amp; Fingern is a show with many similarities to the American show Jackass, and is mainly based on the show hosts Esben Selvig and Thomas Gullestad who invent crazy stunts, hurt themselves and make fun of people. The show is full of embarrassing scenes and absurd situations that arise when the two friends seek out weird environments, challenge each other's weaknesses, and test established truths and phenomena.",
