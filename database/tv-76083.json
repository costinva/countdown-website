  "overview": "Antonio Dumas, a prestigious art historian and cultural manager, cultured and sophisticated, although quite cynical and conceited, is appointed director of an important contemporary art museum in Madrid, after emerging victorious in a competition for that position. Once he has assumed his new position, he must face, in the midst of the unusual fauna of the art world, a range of disparate circumstances and conflicts: from union problems and political pressures, to crazy situations in relation to exhibitions and artists.",
