  "overview": "Affectionately known as â€˜Dipper', Robert DiPierdomenico played 240 games of AFL for the Hawthorn Football Club, winning five Premierships and the 1986 Brownlow Medal. Dipper was as tough as they come on the field and as loveable off the field.Post football, Dipper has become a hugely popular media personality with his larrikin and knockabout attitude, making him one of Australia's most bankable celebrities.This fun-packed destination show, whether it be the city or the bush, the beach or the mountains follows Dipper to some stunning locations the world has to offer.",
