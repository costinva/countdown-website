  "overview": "After Tessa Fowler's skyrocketing career implodes overnight, the disgraced documentarian escapes to a small, idyllic mountain town called Lowery. It seems like the perfect place to hide: Lowery doesn't allow cellphones, doesn't have internet, and no one knows about Tessa's past.Tessa's determination to leave their investigative days behind them disappears, however, when they find a mysterious box of recordings in their rental home's dingy basement. At first, the recordings seem to be nothing more than security footage. However, when Tessa plays a tape that appears to catch a murder in progress, they can't help but start digging into this seemingly perfect town's disturbing past.",
