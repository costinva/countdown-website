  "overview": "The Curse of Von Dutch: A Brand to Die For chronicles the unbelievable true story behind the rise and fall of the 2000's most iconic fashion trend. In this epic character-driven saga, Venice Beach surfers, gangsters, European garmentos and Hollywood movers and shakers all vie for control of the infamous brand — pushing it from obscurity to one of the most recognizable labels on Earth. After a decade of backstabbing, greed, and bloodshed, their lives – and pop culture – will never be the same.",
