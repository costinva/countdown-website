  "overview": "Kosaka Ren arrives in Japan to take up a special temporary lecturer position at an art university in Kamakura, Japan. He is a young and talented artist, who has a certain aura about him to make people want to get closer to him, but he also keeps a certain distance from everyone around him. Like butterflies that surround a flower, he is surrounded by other people. One day, he meets a certain woman and, because of her, his emotions begin to change. Even though he knows it will hurt ... nevertheless.",
