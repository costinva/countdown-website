  "overview": "For humans, envy, lust, wrath, sloth, greed, pride and gluttony are associated with shameful behavior. For animals, they are simply survival mechanisms. Here, we learn there are unnerving similarities between man and beast. Examine the human psyche and explore how our behavior has evolved from the origins of the seven deadly sins, and how our behavior is paralleled with that of the animal kingdom.",
