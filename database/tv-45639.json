  "overview": "Spanning the 70s, 80s, and 90s over eight half-hour episodes, New Eden is a hilariously complex, true crime parody that begins in 1977, when Katherine Wryfield and Grace Lee attempt to start a large scale feminist utopia, \"New Eden.\" While intentions for this would-be utopia were noble, in the inexperienced hands of Lee and Wryfield, the community quickly devolves into drug addled, alien-goddess worshipping chaosâ€¦ and murder. Definitely some murder.",
