  "overview": "No stranger to television, Tommy has appeared on some of the biggest and most established chat shows in the world. But, for some time, Tommy has wanted to host his own TV chat show – one with a difference. It has all the ingredients of a normal chat show but there was a catch – neither the host or the audience know the identity of the guests until they walk out on stage! The Tommy Tiernan Show is recorded in front of a live audience and will include stand-up from Tommy, live music and plenty of chat….. with a little help from fellow comedian Fred Cooke thrown in.",
