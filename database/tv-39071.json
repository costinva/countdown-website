  "overview": "Presenter Neil Innes has fun exploring the origins of well-known words; and phrases in Away with Words. The 13-part series follows him on his travels from Yarmouth to Ely, Southend, Newmarket, Luton, Southwold, Duxford, Ipswich, Norwich, Corby, Bletchley, Cambridge and Colchester. But it won't be a map so much as a dictionary that he will have as a guide as he looks for the unlikely sources of all sorts of everyday names and sayings, and talks to some of the people who can throw light on them.",
