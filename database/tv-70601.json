  "overview": "Mimo is supposed to become the leader of the village where the famous sky disc is kept. At least that's what his father, the current leader, wants. But Mimo prefers to dream that it would be fairer if everyone could have a say. His sister Leva, on the other hand, would much rather become a leader herself. The siblings and their goat are constantly experiencing new adventures that have to be faced with courage, understanding and humor.",
