  "overview": "It is a contemporary urban workplace drama based on the novel of the same name by Wei Zai. The story revolves around the revival of a national brand in the face of the impact of e-commerce. Xu Si (played by Gong Jun), an investment professional who moves back to mainland China from a Hong Kong investment bank, meets Jiang Hu (played by Zhong Chuxi), the only daughter of the chairman of a national clothing conglomerate. Due to their differing business philosophies, the two are at odds with each other. When Jiang Hu's father's company suddenly goes bankrupt, she finds herself plummeting from the heights of success. Meanwhile, Xu Si, who has always been ambitious, sets his sights on the rubber-soled shoe brand \"Tengyue,\" which was once created by Jiang Hu's father. Determined to save \"Tengyue\" at all costs, Jiang Hu, despite her downfall, engages in a fierce battle with Xu Si. Ultimately, their interactions and struggles will determine the fate of \"Tengyue\" and whether it can be revived.Â ",
