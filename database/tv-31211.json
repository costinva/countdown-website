  "overview": "Eric, Nono and Fran√ßois, three brothers, inherit one of the most beautiful farms in the Morvan. Once in command, they turn out to be the worst farmers in the history of the French peasantry. With them, nothing grows, and the animals lose sight. In order not to end up on the straw and be ashamed of French agriculture, the three brothers decided to use all legal and illegal means to increase production and thus outdo their neighbor, Pauline Leroy, a young agricultural engineer specializing in Organic Agriculture.",
