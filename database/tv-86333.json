When she wakes up, she is shocked to find herself transformed into the wife of Yan Qizhao, the influential president of a prominent trade association. An esteemed husband, endless gold and silver adornments, obedient servantsâ€”every piece of evidence confirms her identity as the president's wife. Yet, Shu Yan grows increasingly certain that something is shrouded in mystery.
