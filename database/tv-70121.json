  "overview": "Keke Wyatt's World is larger than life! Having been in the music game for over three decades, Keke is ready to take her career to the next level with her first new album in over six years.Â This R&amp;B artist must balance her demanding singing career with being a wife, daughter, diva, friend and mother to 11 children, including newborn baby Ke'Zyah. As the pressures mount, she fights to keep it all from unravelling with the help of husband, Zackariah, a stay-at-home dad who manages the house; her mother, Lorna, who is her rock but also stirs up trouble in the family; and manager and BFF Andrae who struggles to keep her on track. Can Keke continue to balance motherhood and family life with the demands of her career and her fans?",
