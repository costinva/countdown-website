  "overview": "In this series, professional makeup artist Lisa Eldridge takes a fascinating journey through the history of hair and makeup.Taking three iconic eras in British history - The Georgians, the Victorians and the 1920s - Lisa explores what the beauty look tells us about the world it grew out of. From the high hair and heavily painted faces of the aristocratic Georgians, to the demure â€˜natural' faces of the middle-class Victorian lady, to the red lipped bobbed hair flapper, the series explores key moments in Britain's past.",
