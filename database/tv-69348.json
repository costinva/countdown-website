  "overview": "Loved by the public, Chuck seems like a real good guy. When he finds himself on the front page of every newspaper and gossip magazine after a scandal that involves him, all of Quebec is shocked, but for those closest to him, this incident is the last straw. His reputation is destroyed and he goes on a retreat to a recovery home for people suffering from different kinds of addictions in order to persuade his wife, his agent and his audience of his (relative) good will. Here's the rub: Chuck doesn't really think he needs help... He tells anyone who will listen that he's just a party guy.",
