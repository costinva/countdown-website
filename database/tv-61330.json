  "overview": "That year is a great cultural plateau led by Marc Labrèche and his collaborators, Simon Boulerice, Émilie Perreault and Fred Savard. Each week, starting from a significant year in our history, they revisit the culture of yesterday and measure it against that of today. Together with their guests, they explore subjects that link the chosen year to what is igniting the contemporary cultural world. Bridging two eras, they share favourites, discoveries and classics. A program where we discuss, question and remember, without taking ourselves too seriously.",
