  "overview": "Having lost her parents in a traffic accident, the idealistic teacher Afet Güçverir traveled all over Anatolia with her younger brother Kerem. Afet Güçverir, who favors creative education rather than rote memorization, has seen various transfers and expulsions and has never forgotten her former colleague and love Tekin Bey, whom she had to leave because he slapped her brother. Years later, she and her brother arrive at Istanbul Rıdvan Kanat High School, their last exile. This transfer will be a new life for Afet Güçverir and the beginning of a long life education for the students.",
