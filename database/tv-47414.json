  "overview": "When tackling a crime, the investigator's only solution is to make the clues talk! There is no such thing as a perfect crime. Assault, kidnapping, murderâ€¦ the culprit always leaves traces behind him. To hook the viewer, all the clues involved in the story are laid out in a CSI forensics lab, staged very esthetically. Each episode is structured around ten clues, presented like the scattered pieces of a macabre jigsaw puzzle. Gradually, the viewer comes to understand the part played by each clue in the investigation, until finally the truth is revealed. Each episode is addictive appointment viewing, captivating storytelling that grips the viewer and doesn't let go until the last minute. Reality trumps fiction!",
