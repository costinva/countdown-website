  "overview": "The documentary series Між крапельками tells about how Ukrainian culture survived in the Soviet Union.  In those dark times, a creative approach to censorship helped to circumvent and defeat it.  Fortunately, not all pro-Ukrainian citizens were imprisoned in camps and mental institutions.  There were many professionals who studied the rules of the game and preserved Ukrainian between drops.",
