  "overview": "Pavia, late Eighties. Max loves comics and American music. He is a maverick in a city where there is nothing to rebel against. In addition, after having neglected high school to follow new friendships and punk evenings, the rejection inevitably arrives. This failure actually turns out to be a new, fatal opportunity: moving to a new school, he meets a new classmate, Mauro. Music makes them inseparable. Thanks to the driving force of Mauro, Max embraces his talent and together with him composes the first songs that will be produced by Claudio Cecchetto. But when success overwhelms them, will Max and Mauro, so different, be able to stay united?",
