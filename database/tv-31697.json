  "overview": "The little prince, who lives on a tiny asteroid with his beloved rose, travels with his only friend, a talking fox, through the galaxy. He lands at planets where the serpent and its black thoughts are suspected to have arrived earlier, each time inspiring or exacerbating a bitter, needless conflict among its human and/or population(s).",
