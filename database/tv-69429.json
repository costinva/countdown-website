  "overview": "Lunar Jim is a stop-motion animation series that transports preschoolers into an exciting world of discovery, fun and adventure. Lunar Jim lives in Moona Luna - a place much like any other, but with one huge difference - it's on the moon! Focusing on the fun of exploration and inquiry, Lunar Jim promotes the active learning of such important life skills as persistence, creativity and cooperation with an inherent emphasis on 'pre-science' skills. Above all, Lunar Jim is about taking delight in discovery.",
