  "overview": "Looks at six decades of Afghan history through the eyes of those who were there: men and women, warriors and civilians, Afghans and foreigners. Their memories of the golden era under King Zahir Shah, the Soviet occupation, the civil war, the Taliban regime, of 9/11 and its aftermath combine with an unparalleled selection of archive footage. Thus, this mini-series grants new insight into what went tragically wrong in the past, and what future is being hoped for.",
