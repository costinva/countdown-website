  "overview": "Sweden's most loved artist Lars Lerin is going back to Lofoten, a place he loves and misses very much. It was here that he found his first love but also went deeper into his addiction and was eventually forced to leave both the relationship and the place to get sober. Now Lars and Junior are visiting Lars' favorite places on Lofoten where they will paint, surf, fish for cod, ride horses and go hiking. They also make new acquaintances with people who also have a life of addiction behind them.",
