  "overview": "In the Liars Club, 5 mythical duos go head-to-head in a game of investigation and bluff in which they have to tell crazy stories that have happened to them... or not! Each duo will tell 3 stories they've experienced together. Except that only one of them is true, and the other two are pure invention! The duos will have to be convincing in their attempts to deceive the others, but also inventive in their investigations to find each other's true story. Not to mention the fact that a pair of usurpers lurks among them, lying throughout the game.",
