  "overview": "Sister Wives explores the complex daily life of a polygamist family. Sister Wives introduces audiences to husband Kody -- along with his three wives; Meri, Janelle and Christine and their combined 13 children -- showing how they attempt to navigate life as a \"normal\" family in a society that shuns their lifestyle. From their unconventional family structure and living arrangements to financial challenges, each half hour episode exposes the inner workings of a polygamist household, revealing the unexpectedly tight-knit and loving relationships between Kody's wives.",
