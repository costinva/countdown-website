  "overview": "Using cutting-edge science as the foundation for outrageous stunts and practical jokes, SciJinks is an all-new science prank show hosted by Johnny Galecki. Galecki, along with science \"prankologists\" Tamara Robertson and Jason Latimer, test out science on unsuspecting marks, drawing from chemistry, physics, technology, engineering and more, with never-before-seen pranks that will introduce audiences to remarkable and unusual scientific discoveries. From showcasing classic chemical reactions under the guise of a cooking class, to controlling the movement of objects with their brains using electroencephalography, the pranks not only contain mind-blowing science, but a heaping dose of chaos too.",
