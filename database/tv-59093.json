  "overview": "Carat is a successful businesswoman who held more power in her hands than Chakrit, her husband. One day he cheated on her with his secretary and asked Carat for a divorce. Even though Carat is already competing with Venice for a good career path, when it comes to Carat's love life, Venice is on her side. Ai, a fourth year student met Carat when she was in a fight with Chakrit. He helped her during that time and they ran into each other in many times after too. He eventually wants to make a move on her and doesn't care about the more than 20 years age difference between them. But it's not going to be easy when Carat's perfect boss, Mark, seems to be interested in her too.Â ",
