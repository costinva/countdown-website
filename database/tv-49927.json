  "overview": "Sue Perkins brings her unique blend of humour and compassion to this extraordinary journey along one of the most contentious borders in the world.In the news coverage of the US, Mexico is full of drug trafficking, violent cartels and desperate migrants - and of course the wall. Sue Perkins has heard everything about the region but she wants to know what life is really like for ordinary people on both sides of the border. She travels 2,000 miles from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, criss-crossing between these two great countries, to meet those who call the borderland home.",
