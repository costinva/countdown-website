  "overview": "Ludvig og Julemanden is a real Christmas adventure, with everything you could wish for in mystery, humor, elves, magic and a real Christmas atmosphere. 11-year-old Ludvig is temporarily moving in with his family at Børglum Kloster. Ludvig is quickly convinced that the monastery contains a secret treasure, and he therefore enters into an agreement with his father. If he finds the treasure, the family stays at the monastery. Santa Claus Nicholas is not allowed to hold a big 500 year Santa Claus anniversary for his wife Julie, and leaves the workshop and takes the rabbit to Børglum Monastery. Here he meets Ludvig, and the two become faithful partners in the hunt for the treasure. However, Ludvig and Santa Claus are not alone in the hunt for the treasure. Børglum Kloster also houses four ghosts who, under the leadership of Bishop Stygge Krumpen, want to regain power over Børglum Kloster.",
