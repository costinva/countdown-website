  "overview": "This historical adventure series is set in the 7th Century and follows the lives of the occupants of the Carpathian basin, at the time before the union of Slav tribes. The plot takes place at the neighboring forts Big table and Furnau, which need each other for trade but the power interests and the pressure from the incoming Avar marauders will put them into conflict. The main heroine, a young girl called Draha (Polina Nosykhina) is different than her peers because she's conscious and ambitious. During her self-discovery, she is accompanied by a mysterious stranger that she saved and named Vlad (Juraj Loj), who is slowly becoming a member of the fort Big table. Although the occupants of the fort did not like him at first, they are getting used to him thanks to his heroic acts - especially against the Avar tribes. Along with Vlad and Draha's story, the series simultaneously follows the story of Radúz (Tomás Mastalír), the son of fort Furnau's elder, who is a proud and well-trained.",
