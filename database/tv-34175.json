  "overview": "Jin Young, a very open-minded and energetic woman, worked for the Seoul Hotel. Her ex-boyfriend Tae Joon resigned and had left for Vegas three years earlier due to an unfortunate incident with a guest. The owner of the hotel had always believed in Tae Joon even more so than his own son, Young Jae. When he died of a heart attack, his wife realized that Jin Young must go to Vegas to bring Tae Joon back so he could help run the hotel, which was falling into pieces. Their rival, Kim Book Man, was determined to acquire the Seoul Hotel.",
