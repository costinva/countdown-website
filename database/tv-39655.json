  "overview": "Carson and Thom are here to help fight the uniformity and ubiquity of American home design with a new business venture in Get a Room with Carson &amp; Thom. Carson has been bitten by the decor bug, and he's looking to his interior designer buddy, Thom, to take him under his wing and teach him the design trade from soup to nuts. Each episode will feature two clients looking to transform a space. Some have big budgets and some small, but they're all trying to create a beautiful room that is unique to them. With Carson's fashion sense and bold personality and Thom's designer acumen and friendliness, the bodacious besties will create breathtaking and affordable redesigns. These two arbiters of style work together, play together, argue, compromise and create spaces as only they can in their quest to make America chic again.",
