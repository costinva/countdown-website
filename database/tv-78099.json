  "overview": "In the 90s, Dino worked for tough gangster Montana and was Moscow's most ruthless debt collector. Now he lives as a hermit in the province. But events unfold in such a way that Dino returns to the capital and starts his old job in order to pay off his debt from the past, which has tormented him all these years and return the woman of his dreams. During Dino's adventures, he will have to face both modern realities and the relict 90s, which have adapted somewhere, withered somewhere, but still deeply rooted in our reality. And Dino, as a guide between two worlds, will once again have to undergo a test of his life principles.",
