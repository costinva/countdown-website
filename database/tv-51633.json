  "overview": "The Bobinogs, Nib, Bobin and Ogi, live in a bobble hat in the village of Abernog. They are mischievous, but likeable, characters who sometimes need help as they encounter everyday problems. When they don't know what to do, they look through the bobinoculars to see what real children do and try to put that information to good use.",
