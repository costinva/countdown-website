  "overview": "Shaking Down The Thunder takes an intimate look at the Sydney Swans' journey to break the longest Premiership drought in AFL history, as they chase the 2005 flag.Under the guidance of new wave coach Paul Roos, the beleaguered \"Bloods\" adopted a new ethos of leadership, brotherhood, commitment and empowerment which resulted in a new brand of football, one that at times raised eyebrows with critics.Lead by a rotating group of captains including Barry Hall, and starring Michael O'Loughlin, Brett Kirk and young guns Adam Goodes, Jude Bolton and Leo Barry, the team would finally take to the hallowed turf at the MCG under blue skies for the AFL Grand Final against West Coast in front of 91,828 passionate fans.Â ",
