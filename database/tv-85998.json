Now historians Dan Snow and Doctor Kate Lister take us into this extraordinary time capsule, to reveal what it would really have been like to live there.They discover everything from exactly what people ate, to where they slept (and who they slept with), what jobs they did and how dangerous the city was at night. This is real life in Pompeii in all its gritty, glorious detail.",
