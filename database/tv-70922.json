  "overview": "Ts Madison tries the weirdest snacks from all over the internet, opening special mystery boxes filled to the brim with viral funky food. She must sample them and decide if she likes it - she ATE - or if it's disgusting - she HATE. From cloyingly-sweet breakfast-flavored cup noodles to mouth-puckering sour pickle ball candy, Maddie holds nothing back, giving us her TRUE reaction. Take a bite 'cause Ts Madison Ate That!",
