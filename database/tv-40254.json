  "overview": "This L.A.-based nuclear-family sitcom was apparently too normal to attract a following, despite teen stars Dweezil and Moon Unit Zappa, whose real unconventional home life with rocker dad Frank was the basis for the series. That reality, however, may have been too wild for CBS, which watered down the original concept.",
