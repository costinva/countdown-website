  "overview": "From political pressure and corporate interests, to technological manipulation and old-fashioned spin, The Weekly with Wendy Mesley reveals what's really at play behind the big stories of the day. The program provides a deeper understanding of what's happening in the world each week by illuminating the influences driving it and the influencers pushing the buttons and pulling the strings. Mesley goes behind the headlines to reveal hidden and sometimes surprising forces shaping the news, our world - and ultimately, you. Broadcast live from CBC in Toronto, the series features a wide range of Canadian and global contributors and guests.",
