  "overview": "Elada's family comes into possession of a beautiful rose-pink lutaya fabric that was sown by Elada's grandmother, Elawin, for Princess Minphayu. Later, however, grandmother Elawin mysteriously became blind. Due to her interests in historical textile, Elada studied the preservation of ancient fabric at the Saodor Textile Institution in England. After her graduation, Elada finally returned to Thailand with newly made friends Tanthai and Phumaree, a couple she met during travels, as well as Anthony, a British man who has travelled to Thailand to investigate a certain Lieutenant Colonel David Danison. All of these people must now face the pink rose fabric and find the mystery behind it.Â ",
