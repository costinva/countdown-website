His friends Leo, Sam and his little sister Poppy often join him on his adventures to magical food lands like the Wild Spaghetti West, the Prehistoric Broccolisaurus Forest and Pirate-Infested Fishstick Seas!Though he'd never admit it to his mum, the audience suspects that Ollie always looks forward to trying the next food and launching into his next meal.
