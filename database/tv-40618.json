When he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he considers what will happen to his family when he dies.In a raid by the Anti-narcotics Police organized by Walter's brother-in-law, Henry Navarro, he recognizes a former student of his, José Miguel Rosas, whom he contacts to manufacture and sell methamphetamine and thus ensure the economic well-being of his family.
