  "overview": "Ever wonder what it's like to get hit in the head with a 1-ton sledgehammer with horns? It's all in a day's work for a cowboy. Spike TV brings you onto the dirt for the most dangerous 8 seconds in sports - Toughest Cowboy. Toughest Cowboy follows twelve real-life cowboys as they risk life and limb competing to win the deed to a spectacular ranch in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming. Each week riders compete in three punishing roughstock events - bareback bronc riding, saddle bronc riding and bull riding - with the lowest two point-getters forced to go head-to-head in a bull riding duel to see who will be eliminated. Not only do you get to see intense rodeo action - you get to hear it from the voices of the cowboys themselves. No commentators calling the action, this is first-hand grit, sweat and blood. No other program takes you right where the action is and documents it right from the competitors.",
