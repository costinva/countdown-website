  "overview": "SEC on ABC on November 21, 2020, ABC aired its first SEC regular season game since 1995, Florida–Vanderbilt, which was moved from ESPN due to the postponement of an ACC game (Clemson–Florida State) that was originally expected to air on the network due to COVID-19 pandemic complications.On December 10, 2020, ESPN announced that it had acquired the top-tier rights to the SEC under a 10-year, $3 billion contract to begin in the 2024 season; ABC will hold rights to the top SEC game of the week (replacing CBS). As before, they will primarily air in the 3:30 window, but there will also be the possibility for games to be carried on Saturday Night Football. ABC will also hold rights to the SEC Championship Game. During the Disney upfronts, ESPN unveiled an SEC on ABC branding for these games.",
