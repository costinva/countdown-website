  "overview": "Trivia Quest is Netflix's first daily, interactive trivia series. It takes players on a mission to help our hero, Willy, rescue the animated citizens of Trivia Land from the Evil Rocky, who's bent on hoarding all the knowledge in the world. One new episode will be available every day in April (30 total), with each episode featuring 24 questions (12 standard and 12 hard) across categories including science, history, entertainment, sports, art and geography. Each question is a multiple-choice play, with four potential answers to choose from. It's all based on etermax's hit Trivia Crack, the #1 multi-platform trivia franchise in the world. And it's up to you to select the right answers and save the day!",
