  "overview": "A twist on the original unscripted FOX dating series that turned reality television on its head, Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer will feature two single men - one is a millionaire, and the other is an \"average Joe\" with little to his name. Twenty women will date both of them, but they will have no idea which Joe is rich. As love connections are made and each guy finds his perfect match, the women must ask themselves what is more important... Love or Money?",
