  "overview": "Passionate brokers open the hunt for Flanders' most seductive real estate in the new season for House Hunters and the title of best broker. Every week three house hunters show what they have in store and in the same region they look for the dream house for their customers. The brokers can follow each other's home visits live and of course also provide the necessary comments. At the end of the day, however, it is the buyers who decide which seller will be the best.",
