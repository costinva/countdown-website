  "overview": "In this modern day reimagining of Akira Kurosawa's film Yojimbo, Jyouji (\"George\") Kodama has arrived in Kimujuku, a town distinctly divided by two rival factions, in order to search for a man named Genzo Araki. Unable to find him, he instead finds that Kimujuku's residents are hiding something, and begins working for the town's factions in an effort to uncover the secret.Note that English episode titles were created for International release in 2004, but they do not correspond to any official Japanese ones, since none existed. Some later Japanese DVD releases or reprints retroactively listed English titles or katakana approximations, but these were based on the English version. Original Japanese release just had episode numbers included (第1話 ... 第25話), there were no official or any other episode titles prior to International localized release several years later which added titles on their own, and not based on Japanese ones, which were non-existent.",
