  "overview": "Maevika, the only heiress of Superior Group—one of the country's leading department store conglomerates—is a confident and self-assured young woman. But her confidence crumbles the day she loses to Aywarin, the only heiress of Orianna Group, one of the largest hotel empires in the nation, during a joint school project competition. Years pass, this time as leaders of their respective empires—competing head-to-head for the high-stakes Greater Duty-Free concession, a multi-billion project. Circumstances force them into close proximity, transforming their rivalry into an uneasy alliance. For Mae, this closeness becomes a strategy to uncover Ai's secrets and win the bid. But for Ai, it is the chance to get closer to the woman she has secretly loved since the day they met. ",
