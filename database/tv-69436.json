  "overview": "Ten participants with various functional challenges cycle from Lindesnes to Nordkapp on double tandem bicycles. Tandemeventyret project started as a wild idea, but ends up as a unique and inspiring journey. Through 2,500 kilometers of spectacular scenery and both physical and mental challenges, the participants experience togetherness and mastery. The TV team was allowed to join to document the trip, but the group has organized the trip themselves, and nothing that happens is directed.",
