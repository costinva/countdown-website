  "overview": "How did it come to pass that eight members of the same family could be brutally murdered execution-style in four different locations in one night by members of another family they called friends? One of largest murder investigations in Ohio's history rips off the veneer of small-town America, exposing an underbelly of violence, pitting family against family, mother against son, and brother against brother in a haunting story of lies, secrets, and betrayal.",
