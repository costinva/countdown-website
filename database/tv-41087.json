  "overview": "Comedy legend Grado hosts three teams of contestants driving to a new mystery destination, guided by a talking sat-nav asking them questions along the journey. Answer correctly and they follow the shortest route, but a wrong answer means a wrong turn, a diversion and added miles to their trip. It is the team with the lowest mileage that wins the cash prize so they want to keep to the straightest road possible.",
