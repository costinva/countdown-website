  "overview": "Un gars, une fille explores the differences between the male and female perspective in highly identifiable situations. At the movies, in the bathroom, at the gym, on holiday, at the supermarket or with the in-laws, the show's couple is the perfect example of what happens when men and women try to live together. Whether they are deciding what film to see, what food to eat, what friends to hang out with, how to get ahead in their careers or when to get married or have a baby, men and women usually can't seem to agree on anything. No subject is too taboo to be turned into a hilarious commentary on modern life. Her impeccable female logic and his no nonsense attitude to life will have you cheering for one or the other, or both!",
