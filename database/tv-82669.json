  "overview": "Sam Pang TonightÂ is a brand-new show defying convention by bringing viewers something refreshingly familiar: a tonight show. Hosted by, you guessed it, Sam Pang.Sam's no stranger to Aussie audiences, he's buzzed in from the front-right position for more than a decade on the fast and funny Have You Been Paying Attention?, he's hosted the 2023 and 2024 Logie Awards and he's a co-host on Seven's The Front Bar. And now he's got his very own tonight show, filmed in front of a live studio audience.Expect a monologue that both celebrates and roasts the week's news, a mix of local and international guests, along with plenty of Sam's friends from the comedy world joining in the fun across the eight-episode season.",
