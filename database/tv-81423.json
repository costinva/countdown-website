  "overview": "The series takes place in a beautiful town on the border with Poland, where a field hospital has been set up during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The main characters are doctors, volunteers, and highly qualified specialists from different countries: Ukraine, Israel, Poland, and America. They have given up their quiet lives to help and save the lives of those affected by the hostilities, both civilians and defenders who are heroically defending our country. Each of them has their own story, often based on real events. Amidst the loud sounds of war, the hospital becomes a place where new lives are born, where even love can emerge in painful circumstances.",
