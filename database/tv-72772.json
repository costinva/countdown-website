  "overview": "In the summer of 1965, FC Bayern Munich achieved promotion to the Bundesliga. Five up-and-coming footballers who are still inextricably linked to the club and German football today play a major role in this: Gerd Müller, Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer, Paul Breitner and Uli Hoeneß. In addition to the personal lives, the series tells about a team between 1965 and 1974 that came from nothing.",
