  "overview": "Conquest and the struggle of power, victory and defeat, love and betrayal, the rise of culture and the ashes of conflagration – these are just some of the elements of the Rurik dynasty.Founded by the eponymous Varangian prince, the Rurik dynasty ruled the territory of Kievan Rus from 882, and later, several neighbouring principalities including the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Their rule continued until 1610 and the Time of Troubles, after which they were succeeded by the Romanovs.Throughout their rule, the Rurikids fortified, defended and expanded their territory - sometimes with fierce and terrifying battles, sometimes with reconciliation and peace treaties. Most importantly, however, it was under their rule that Russian culture developed, and the Russian nation emerged to become the vast transcontinental and multi-ethnic state that exists today.",
