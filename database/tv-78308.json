  "overview": "After the death of his Mom, Chris developed an unhealthy obsession with the hair salon chair that killed her. In order to help him through the grieving process, his best friend Gabriel kidnaps Chris in hopes that a road trip with those closest to him (including the chair) will help him move on. Things get weird when they discover that the salon chair gives those close to it superhuman powers. They then find themselves at a camp for super-powered youth, where they learn how to control their powers.",
