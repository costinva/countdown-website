  "overview": "Eight days left. A 40 kilometer wide meteor is racing toward Earth at a speed of 30,000 kilometers an hour. The anticipated strike zone is right in the middle of Europe. Estimated European survival rate: Zero. The United States try to knock the meteor off course with nuclear weapons, but fail. All of Europe is on the run. Acht Tage tells the story of a world we've never seen before: People suddenly can break the speed limit at will, have wild unprotected sex, do all the drugs they want, shop with no money, live without working, love with no consequences but in the end, the only thing that matters is: What's really important to you in your final days and hours?",
