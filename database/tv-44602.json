  "overview": "Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer is chronicling the serial killer Ted Bundy's relationship with his long-term girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall. The docuseries reframing Bundy's crimes from a female perspective, delving into how his pathological hatred of women collided with the culture wars and feminist movement of the 1970s, culminating in the infamous true-crime saga. After nearly 40 years of silence, Kendall and her daughter Molly share their experiences with Bundy and provide an archive of never-before-seen family photos.",
