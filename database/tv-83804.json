  "overview": "Ana Páez was a 35-year-old fashion designer who was found dead in a tourist apartment in Barcelona on February 19, 2008, naked and with a plastic bag covering her head. How did she die? Was it a sexual crime or a sadistic game gone wrong? This was the initial hypothesis with which the police were working until Angi appeared. This documentary miniseries revisits what the media dubbed 'The Almost Perfect Crime' and sheds light on the figure of María Ángeles Molina ('Angi') and her past with her husband, Juan Antonio Álvarez Litben, who died unexpectedly in 1996.",
