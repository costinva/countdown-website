  "overview": "Before we ate chicken for dinner, now they turn into concrete. Tons of vegetables are also thrown away, because they have the wrong shape or size and goat kittens turn into mink feed. This is a series about the hidden food waste in Norway. Host Marit Evertsen Grimstad will save an entire chicken house from becoming rubbish, she therefore invites industry and food chains to a charity event, to get the chickens slaughtered and out in the store as food.",
