  "overview": "Ewout Genemans follows the police officers in Arnhem. For eighty days he follows twelve officers closely and no moment is the same. In addition to nerve-racking chases and intense situations at home, there are also funny, emotional and frightening moments. Only in this way does Ewout get to know the person behind the uniform.",
