  "overview": "The Hillbilly Bears played on a social stereotype of the \"hillbilly\", with a gun-toting, mumbling father Paw Rugg who was always \"feudin\" (the \"feudin\" was usually a lethargic operation, in which the protagonists fired the same bullet back and forth from the comfort of their rocking chairs) with their neighbors, the Hoppers.",
