  "overview": "The Women of Brewster Place is an American television miniseries. It is a gripping and loving group portrait of seven black women whose backs are literally against the wall; a wall whose crumbling brick facade has turned the address of Brewster Place into both a real and symbolic dead end. It is a street filled with tales of courage and anguish, a city block where compassionate energy is inevitably at war with implacable desolation.",
