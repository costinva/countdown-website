  "overview": "The series tells Melody's story, an adolescent full of dreams that seem impossible. Accompanied by her best friends, she sings in the subway of a small city, dreaming of being able to make a living from her music, but without her family knowing, because they strictly forbid her from embracing her vocation, simply due to fear. Melody passionately admires Layla, a pop music star that lives in the United States and towards whom she feels an irrational attachment. Melody wants to be like her, although she knows that meeting her is impossible. Layla, on the other hand, understands that fame is not the most important thing in life and tries to reconnect with her deepest wish, to be herself again. Suddenly, a strange and magical connection occurs between them, joining their worlds over a great distance.",
