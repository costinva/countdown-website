  "overview": "Spencer's BIG 30 is a fast-paced series featuring healthy, hearty meals for four that can be made by anyone in around 30 minutes, for around 30 dollars. Keeping the pace, while guiding us from prep to plate, the host gives his top tips and tricks for cutting cooking time down, without sacrificing flavour. To prove how efficient his meals are, he actually cooks the entire meal in one take and it's always around 30 minutes. That's right - no television tricks in this series. While the kitchen may get a little messy, Spencer's process is natural, fun, and easy to follow.",
