  "overview": "Drawing from the techniques of Roman Polanski and Wes Craven, The 3rd Floor is a terrifying tale of what happens to an everyday office when a customer comes in and puts a satanic pagan gypsy curse on it. It's filled with death, devastation...and a few laughs. More than a horror flick, The 3rd Floor is a total horror experience via the mind of Ryan Howard - a bright young talent with a brilliantly dark imagination. It's insane!Â ",
