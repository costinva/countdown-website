  "overview": "The power of terrorism and the power of underworld no longer mean gunshots and hoaxes. ‘Powder' is the story of the new scenario in substance abuse - a generation embracing drugs as part of their living and about the men who know how inject this habit steadily so as to make fortune out of it.  Powder – an insight of the drug lord, Naved Ansari, and an honest team of Narcotics Control Bureau led by Usmaan Malik who plans to nab Ansari before he can hoodwink the system into letting him go Scot free. The web of power, addiction, money, values, corruption, justice, and deceit is what powder will take you through on its journey.",
