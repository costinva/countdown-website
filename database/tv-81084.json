  "overview": "Lava's mother sends him to live with his young uncle by the beach and he's immediately put to work. One day, he finds a man washed up on the shore. At the hospital, Dr. Wut diagnoses the man with amnesia and his uncle volunteers Lava as his caretaker. Lava names him Wave and reassigns all his duties to the stranger. Wave is surprisingly fussy and inept at manual labor, hinting at a pampered past.",
