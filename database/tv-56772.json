  "overview": "Haring Agat and Reyna Celebes are the rulers and keepers of this secret world. Atlantika is in danger now because of the betrayal of the ambitious Barracud. And in the heart of the ocean, a war begins. The only hope of Atlantika lies in a young man named Asyano. His mission is to find and bring back the two missing princesses of Atlantika. One has been prophesied to be the future Queen while the other has powers to sunder and destroy their underwater world. One he will love, the other he must kill. But what if he loves the one he must destroy? Aquano must find them before Barracud makes them instruments of his evil schemes. Two different worlds are about to meet and collide. Two hearts will find each other in the midst of war. One city's life hangs in the hands of one man's courage.",
