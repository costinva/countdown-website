  "overview": "After the departure of the head of the family, Nikolai Petrovich, Kostya and Vera with their children move to a new apartment, and Galina Ivanovna to the cottage. Meanwhile, the search for himself forces Lenya to move first to her mother, and then to her younger brother. Masha's fiance Sergey will also share the living space with the Voronins. A simple guy from the province does not like Kostya, and now he, like Galina Ivanovna at the time, is looking for flaws in his future son-in-law in order to get rid of an unenviable match for his daughter.",
