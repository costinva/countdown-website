  "overview": "A long long time ago, in Camelot Castle, when magic was a part of everyday life, three young squires led by young Arthur and the fearless Princess Guinevere formed the Fraternity of the Round Table. Their goal was to put their knightly ideals (a far cry from the ones they were being taught!) into practice. Having high ideals about justice, solidarity and righteousness is one thing, but deploying them is a whole different ball game, as our valiant heroes discover while attempting to shake the \"Medieval Establishment\" to create a brand-new world of chivalry.",
