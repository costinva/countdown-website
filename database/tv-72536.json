  "overview": "Thirty-five-year-old Fyodor Sadovsky is a modest director of a cleaning company, in whose life there has long been no place for new people, let alone exploits. For the past few years, his only entertainment has been chess tournaments with his best friend Borya and work. At the same time, on the house where Fyodor lives, there is a memorial plaque in memory of his father - the famous Soviet cosmonaut, in the shadow of whose glory Fyodor has lived since childhood.Everything changes when Alyona, a girl from Salsk who knows no boundaries - neither personal nor communal - moves into the apartment opposite. At first glance, there is nothing in common between them, but unbeknownst to himself, Fyodor falls in love. However, the situation is aggravated by the presence of Alena's ex-husband, a jealous widower of Serega.",
