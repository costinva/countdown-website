  "overview": "A story of how a top diva in Japan, Ayumi Hamasaki, was born, her meeting and partings. This is the first dramatization of the much-talked-about original book with adaptations specific to the drama.In Japan, in the 1990s, Ayumi Hamasaki was called Ayu and had become a superstar known throughout Japan.The story unfolds against the background of Velfarre in Roppongi, opened in 1994 as the \"biggest disco in Asia\", the neon flooded scramble crossing in Shibuya and the dance music that dominated the music scene in Japan and the new music that came after. We will see the glamorous mainstream of the music scene, the hidden undercurrents behind the scenes and the overall light and shadow of the turbulent music scene depicted in overwhelming scale. This is the tumultuous story of the encounter and parting of Masa, a producer of all time who changed Japanese music history and still keeps on creating legends, and Ayu, who had become a top diva of Japan.",
