  "overview": "Sept. 11, 2001, is a day that no American will ever forget. Today, nearly a decade after the horrific attacks on the original World Trade Center, a massive effort is under way to reshape ground zero into an expansive 16-acre complex the likes of which has never been seen before. To document this historic undertaking, Discovery Channel will be on the ground alongside the men and women who have dedicated their lives to the rebuilding effort until the nationally televised unveiling of the new ground zero with President Barack Obama on Sept. 11, 2011. Along the road to next year's unveiling ceremony, Discovery Channel will bring viewers updates from the construction site.",
