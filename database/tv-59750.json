  "overview": "Alan Cartwright is a car dealer with a difference. He gets up when he wants and refuses to follow the crowd in everything he does. He may be hard-up but he only buys cars that \"float his boat,\" and if they don't, sell he keeps them or modifies them, to dial in a little extra fun.",
