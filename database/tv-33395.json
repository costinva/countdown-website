  "overview": "Sam Swift, the former star of a hit cop series, is fresh out of-rehab following a bender of epic proportion. Desperate to restart her career, she talks her way into shadowing rough-and-tumble private investigator Eddie as research for a potential comeback role. Though lone wolf Eddie resents the babysitting gig, high-spirited Sam proves herself to be surprisingly valuable, drawing on her acting skills and 200 episodes of playing a detective. When the press touts Sam's role in solving a high-profile case, Eddie finds his phone ringing off the hook with new clients looking to hire the pair.",
