  "overview": "A new UKTV Original series for Yesterday about the dying art of repairing electronics, fronted by super-fixer Rob Howard, one of the UK's last remaining full-time repair men of retro-electronic products.At one time, Britain had an electronics repairer on every street corner. From the 1930s to the 1980s, electronic gadgets were built to be repaired and to last a lifetime. Whether it's a classic American jukebox, a retro pinball machine, a boombox or a vintage radio, super-fixer Rob Howard and his network of experts, including Matt, are ready to find, fix, restore and revive \"anything old with a plug on it\".Shamil and his dad T have a wealth of knowledge about vintage electronics and find design classics ripe for restoration and re-sell.",
