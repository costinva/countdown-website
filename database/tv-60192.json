  "overview": "Once upon a time in a beautiful yet mysterious country, there lived three sisters named Türkan, Dönüş, and Derya. As a close-knit family, they would dream of a promising future every night. Perhaps such an upbringing, that was similar to a fairy tale on the pine-scented streets of Ayvalık, had not prepared them for the grim reality of adulthood. Over time, the sisters discover that life and the choices that are accompanied by it are not as easy as they seem. Inconceivable secrets can be hidden even by those who are trusted the most and horrific illnesses can lead to the resurrection of the past. This leads them to the question: Is there anything in the world that time cannot heal?",
