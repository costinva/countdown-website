  "overview": "When an attack happens, investigators must first consider motive. All too often, the true identity of a killer is masked by a twisted web of deceit in which revenge and hate are the fuel feeding their dark souls. Hiding in plain sight, they can spend years in the shadows before finally being caught - a single clue unlocking a Pandora's box of haunting tales of terror, loathing and fear. As identities are revealed, a chain is completed - uncovering a grim series of interconnected crimes and a trail of suffering in their wake that haunts communities and loved ones for decades.",
