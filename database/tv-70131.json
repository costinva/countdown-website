  "overview": "Computer science major Chu Sangwoo is the epitome of an inflexible and strict rule-abiding person. While working on a liberal arts group project with freeloaders who don't put in any effort, Sangwoo reasonably decides to remove their names from the final presentation. But he didn't imagine how involved he would become with the person whose study-abroad plans were messed up because of that project. The involved person: the campus star who everyone knows, Department of Design's Jang Jaeyoung. He has everything from skills, looks, family background, and good relationships except for 1 big problem: Chu Sangwoo.",
