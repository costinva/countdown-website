  "overview": "Kenny Hauk, lead designer of Hauk Designs, works with his crew of expert mechanics and fabricators to build ultra-powerful, one-of-a-kind vehicles that look amazing and can go anywhere. Taking inspiration from iconic styles and designs throughout American history, these beautiful machines transform America's rich past into modern, drivable, show-stopping creations. Simply put, there's no one who can combine American iconography with bad-ass machinery like Kenny Hauk and his team, and it shows in everything they do.",
