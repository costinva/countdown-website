  "overview": "The SkyShowtime Original A Recipe for Murder is a compelling documentary series that chronicles the violent death of Colombian surgeon Edwin Arrieta on a tranquil Thai island, at the hands of Daniel Sancho, a 29-year-old aspiring chef known for his YouTube videos. Sancho, the son of one of Spain's most well-known actors, Rodolfo Sancho, was tried and convicted to life imprisonment in a Thai court earlier this summer. In spite of the trial being covered extensively by the world's media, mysteries remain about the nature of the relationship between Arrieta and Sancho. The five-part series explores the truth behind not only their relationship but also the double life led by each man. While examining a toxic relationship, the shocking discovery of a dismembered body, and the investigation that followed, renowned documentary filmmaker Jose Gomez shines a light on the role of the Thai legal system, the media, and even the audience itself.",
