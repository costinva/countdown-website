  "overview": "The Fatal Conflict - Judea and Rome explores the tumultuous life of King Herod, and unpacks the glorious rise and tragic fall of Judea under the reign of the Roman Empire. These two events, although 70 years apart, are forever connected by one man who was charged with chronicling the events leading to Judea's fall â€” the controversial historian Flavius Josephus.The Fatal Conflict examines history from a fresh perspective, using the words and deeds of this infamous Jewish acolyte, general, historian and alleged traitor. Utilizing a mixed media approach, it breathes life into the story of Jerusalem's rise and fall.",
