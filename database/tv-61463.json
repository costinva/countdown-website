  "overview": "In the Sahel, a group of young soldiers from the 22nd Infantry Regiment of the French Army is ambushed. During what was to be a reconnaissance mission, these volunteers find themselves ambushed. The reinforcements were slow to come to their aid and over the hours the situation got bogged down. In this almost desert valley, thousands of kilometers from their homes and under enemy fire, what are those who signed up a few months before dreaming? And why had they done it? Was it for the love of the motherland and the defense of its interests? Or did they enlist for travel, pay, and automatic rifles?",
