  "overview": "For the first time in Ireland, we get a fly-on-the-wall insight into a small world where big things happen – welcome to the wonderful world of the Naíonra. In this heartwarming three-part series, cameras follow all the action in two Naíonra over the course of one year, one in Tallaght, Dublin, and one in Mallow, County Cork. Máire Uí Bhriain is the director of Naíonra Thomáis Dáibhís in Mallow, and she relishes connecting with the children by connecting with her own inner child. In Tallaght, Aisling Breathnach is director of Naíonra Chaitlín Maude and she loves the honesty of the kids and how they make her laugh.These two Naíonraí are not in a Gaeltacht and most of these children start with no Irish, but their parents want to offer them the gift of Gaeilge… and in the Naíonra we see their first steps in becoming fluent in a second language. As we observe the children, experts enrich our understanding of their early experiences. Speech &amp; Language Therapist Dr. Ciara O'Toole explains throughout the series how we acquire language and how the brain is wired to learn multiple languages from birth. But these early learners aren't just learning a second language. This is a period in childhood development where the brain is exploding with activity as it develops hugely, as Clinical Psychologist Dr. Cáit Verling explains. Education expert An tOllamh Emeritus Pádraig Ó Duibhir gives context to the experience of the children and their teachers as we join them on this journey in one of the most important years in life, where so many of the skills we use throughout our lives are first learned - understanding, communication and friendship.",
