  "overview": "Diego, a Mossad agent whose sister was killed in the Argentina terrorist attack, takes a leave of absence and hooks up with Gisela, a local journalist to find those responsible. Their journey to uncover the truth draws them into a world of espionage, intelligence agencies and arms dealers. A dubious world in which lies are truths, and justice and revenge become indistinguishable. The journey that the two embark on will eventually lead to a re-examination of their connection with their families and even their concept of self-identity.",
