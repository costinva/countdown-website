  "overview": "Tenko and the Guardians of the Magic is an American magical girl cartoon show produced by Saban that centered around the fictional adventures of Japanese real-life magician Princess Tenko, Mariko Itakura. After each episode, she would appear in a live-action segment to perform an illusion or do her \"Teach-A-Trick,\" a segment that teaches the audience a simple magic trick they could perform at home. Unfortunately, the show failed to attract an audience and production was cancelled after a single season, which ran from 1995-1996.",
