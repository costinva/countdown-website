  "overview": "Lytk-Angeles, the state of Moskvachussets, has always been a quiet town where every gang had its rightful place. The Colombians smoked plantain, the Irish sipped beer, and the Chinese ate noodles. But one day the evil Russian Communists came and brought sugar with them. They slaughtered all the street vendors of plantain, seized control of the production of matryoshka dolls (a traditional Yugoslav business) and got the whole city hooked on white powder.This will be the last case for Eustace Lynch. Famous for his lucky tattoo, an Irish gangster comes to Lytk-Angeles from Dublin (also known as Dubna) to get rid of the Communists. At the same time, Sally Raptor, a police officer from palm beach (also known as Gelendzhik) arrives in the city with a similar task.Zakon i Besporyadok is a parody of the films of the 80s and 90s that we watched on videotapes with one-voice voice-over as a child, and a tribute to that forever-gone era when the screen belonged entirely to evil Russians, Asian martial artists and drinking detectives in ridiculous hats. Each episode parodies one of your favorite genres: the characters don't change, but they end up in an Asian fighting game, a crime Thriller, or even a neo-noir story.",
