In his past life, Ye Beichen intended to secretly protect Shangguan Weiyang, but she resentfully shot herself and fell off the city wall donned in red, sinking him into an abyss of devastation. He was agonized and aggrieved, regretting his own fulfillment. So the obsessed Ye Beichen wants to reverse fate even at the expense of his life, just for a chance to see and love her again! In this life, Shangguan Weiyang is reborn, but she is forcibly taken and controlled by her former enemy Ye Beichen! Little did they know that Ye Beichen would be so possessed by his love that he would make his niece-in-law his wife! He is willing to be a murderous devil in Shangguan Weiyang's eyes as long as she is safe. The two of them are deeply entangled in love and hate, like fate unable to rest until death. Despite the most fatal misunderstanding, he keeps his deepest love a secret to himself. Unfortunately, two lifetimes of devoted love result in the most incomprehensible endingâ€¦",
