  "overview": "Sally is the princess of the \"witch world\", Astoria, who longs to visit the mortal realm - presumably to make friends her own age. One day, Sally teleports to the \"mid world\" (Earth), where she uses her magic to fend off a couple of burglars menacing two young schoolgirls. Immediately befriended by her new acquaintances - tomboyish Yoshiko Hanamura (known affectionately as \"Yotchan\") and girly Sumire Kasugano - Sally decides to stay on indefinitely, leading to various kinds of sh≈çjo mischief in the best Japanese tradition. As with Samantha Stevens in Bewitched, Sally tries to keep her supernatural abilities secret, assuming the role of a human child.",
