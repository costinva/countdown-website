  "overview": "Ryota's only joy when she started working as a web writer was \"Instant Ramen Array Jinbu\", a side activity that was continued with six people including her friends Arisa, Kyoichi, Sho, Meirin, and her younger sister Aoi since school days. The members devise an emotional instant ramen arrangement recipe in rotation for a week, and upload a video on social media to share it. Recipes with different tastes, made by members, give new discoveries and surprises every time, adding one method to a familiar taste to make it a light and colorful dish. So, whose turn is it today?",
