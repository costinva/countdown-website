  "overview": "What happens when Spike TV gets a bunch of talented comedians, who also happen to be good friends, together, gives them a camera and free license to create whatever they want for a new television series? You get the original non-scripted sketch comedy series The Lance Krall Show. Lance Krall is not only the star of this new series that bears his name, but he is also the series creator, writer, director and executive producer.",
