  "overview": "In this new six-part UKTV Original series, award-winning mechanical engineer, Dr Shini Somara, will turn to back copies of Practical Mechanics magazine - once the best-selling bible of British inventors -and challenge a dream design team to reinvent its vintage blueprints for the 21st century.Each week, Dr Shini will lead a diverse crew of engineers, crafters and gadgeteers as they try to update these vintage designs from the 30s, 40s and 50s and make them fit for purpose in the modern world.Working from a vintage shed on a Yorkshire airfield, the build teams will be drawn from a pool of returning experts, with Dr Shini allocating team members to the projects that most suits their skills.The reinvention challenges range from a build-at-home car, a boat and a camping trailer…to a pedal-powered washing machine, a burglar alarm and a lie detector.They've set themselves just four weeks - the time between each edition of the magazine – in which to design and build them.Filled with imaginative and ambitious designs - and combining old-fashioned DIY skills with clever modern technology - the series aims to re-ignite the nation's passion for innovation.",
