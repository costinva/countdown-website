  "overview": "Outreau : Un cauchemar français delves into one of France's biggest judicial tragedies. In the early 2000s, in northern France, the young Judge Burgaud is in charge of investigating accusations of paedophilia in a family. But the case becomes increasingly complex as the investigation moves ahead, when other inhabitants of the town appear to also be involved. Between accusation and counter-accusations, the legal machine entangles.",
