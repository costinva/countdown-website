  "overview": "Rachel, 40, celebrates her divorce in her own way: long, joyfully and very loudly; she has just obtained a comfortable pension, the apartment with a terrace and shared custody of her daughter, Rosa, 7 years old. But she quickly hits a wall when she discovers that her ex-husband, Yanis, is now going out with her lawyer... hers. Upset and pathetic, she sets out to get him back by trying to pass herself off as a \"super mom\", a great friend, an invested neighbor... But the pressure is too much, Rachel accumulates disasters and bad choices which very quickly move her away from the perfect woman and bring her closer to the \"unworthy mother\".",
