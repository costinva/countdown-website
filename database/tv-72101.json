  "overview": "During the Northern Song Dynasty, a bustling corner of Qu'er Alley in Bianliang City was home to the Zhao family, five individuals with wildly different personalities. Zhao Buyou, a low-ranking clerk, sought a simple life, while his wife, Wen Yue, aimed to buy land and secure their future. Despite frequent arguments, the family remained close. Their lives took a dramatic turn when they were drawn into the sensational Mei Ship case. Solving mysteries became a journey of tackling family struggles and growing together. Case by case, they exposed the so-called \"Good Man of Jiangnan\" as a fraud, broke a market monopoly, and uncovered political corruption. In the end, they safeguarded their family's happiness and brought peace to Bianliang.",
