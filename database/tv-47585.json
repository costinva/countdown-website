  "overview": "In the maelstrom of a commercial television newsroom in 1986, Dale Jennings is a diligent young reporter, desperate to become a newsreader. Helen Norville is a notoriously ‘difficult' star newsreader determined to build credibility. Paired together over three months, Dale and Helen will cover an extraordinary chain of news events — from the shock of the Challenger explosion, to the hype of Halley's Comet, to the complexities of the AIDS crisis. From messy beginnings, a deep bond is formed that will upend their lives and transform the very fabric of the nightly news bulletin. This is a story of a grand, unconventional relationship in a world on the cusp of change.",
