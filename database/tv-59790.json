  "overview": "Working in the Emergency Room is all about rolling with the punches and is not for the squeamish. For the doctors and nurses at the 21 SignatureCare Emergency Center locations throughout Texas, it's a chance to take on the challenge of helping people with painful, unusual, and sometimes even gruesome emergency cases. In an all-new series that the question ‘how did that get there?' audiences will be guided by fashion model turned ER physician, Dr. Ruby Rose, one of twenty-one medical directors who oversee these freestanding ERs. She will treat us to everyday situations in which things end up in places they just shouldn't be - from a monster bug getting stuck in a patient's ear to a piece of concrete getting trapped in a patient's leg, what goes in must come out!",
