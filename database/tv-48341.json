  "overview": "The Okavango in Southern Africa is a special river born in the highlands of Angola. Unlike most rivers that flow toward the shores of a nearby ocean, it instead runs inland through Botswana. After more than 1,000 miles, the waters of the Okavango create a huge river delta before finally disappearing into the Kalahari Desert. The Okavango Delta is a true natural wonder â€“ an unlikely oasis and lush paradise in the middle of a hostile desert that supports and feeds an incredible abundance of wildlife. Here an all-star cast of charismatic African wildlife lives and dies in the timeless drama of survival. This three-part, blue-chip series, filmed by award-winning Dereck and Beverly Joubert (Nature: Soul of the Elephant), presents a unique ecosystem at its finest and most beautiful.",
