  "overview": "Join Michael Portillo as he takes us on a Long Weekend to three of his favourite European cities: Madrid, Prague and Milan.On each Long Weekend Michael reveals the secrets, sites and people that make these cities tick, finding the best restaurants, bars, food markets and hotels, as well as the places only the locals know and love. Exploring hidden neighbourhoods off the tourist trail, and going behind-the-scenes of major landmarks he reveals how in just a busy weekend you can find the real city as well as the classic Royal palaces, cathedrals, galleries, and museums, which open their doors and welcome us all in.In each city Michael meets up with locals with a particular connection to that place, who will show him the city's hidden treasures. Most are English speaking (though Michael's bilingual Spanish also serves him well) as they introduce him to their passions that characterise these wonderful welcoming cities, revealing rich histories, diverse architecture and food heritages, as well as unknown gems and secret locations you'll never find unless you're really in the know.",
