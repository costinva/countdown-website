  "overview": "Anne and Erik Merz have been married for a long time, when they realize that they actually are no longer in love. Deciding to separate is not so easy, because the two not only have a large house and a pubescent son, they also work in together for Anne's father Ludwig, who is beginning to suffer from dementia. And under these circumstances Ludwig does not want to give his son-in-law the company. Will that work out: to separate privately and continue to work together? Of course not. But it will be funny.",
