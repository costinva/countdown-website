  "overview": "Best friends Max and Faye as they stare down the barrel of 30. It's a slice of life: saddled with student debt, degrees no longer matter, too many options, looking for purpose. As a generation. Max and Faye bounce from job to job and from poor decision to poor decision, with only each other to rely on.",
