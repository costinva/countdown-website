  "overview": "Ellis will follow DCI Ellis, a tenacious cop who is parachuted into failing investigations. Each two-hour episode sees Ellis â€“ accompanied by her right-hand man DS Harper, arrive at a different police station, where she will have to win over the local detectives and immerse herself in the cases she has come to solve. As a black female cop, Ellis is used to being dismissed and overlooked, but she is a first-class murder detective, with a determination for justice and a deep well of compassion for those who need it.",
