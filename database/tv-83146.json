  "overview": "A new reality show in which high stakes, risky moves and brilliant combinations are on the verge of fantasy. \"A big jackpot. Bangkok is a game worthy of Guy Ritchie's script. 12 star pairs, one suitcase with 10 million rubles, ten empty ones and one with a black flight pass. Here, every move decides everything. Bluffing, risky exchanges and big bets — participants can not only hit the jackpot, but also radically change their fate. And the presenters Pavel Volya and Laysan Utyasheva will not give them a minute's peace and will add spice to the game.",
