  "overview": "Last September Lily Allen and her sister Sarah Owen launched their vintage clothing store Lucy in Disguise. Channel 4 cameras followed the sisters every step of the way as Lily traded in the security of a hugely successful music career to move into the precarious world of running a business. But that's not the only change in Lily's life.
