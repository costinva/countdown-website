  "overview": "Eve Plumb is an expert home renovator and an avid collector of vintage d√©cor and memorabilia. She also is a talented painter with a keen design sense. In the Generation Renovation, she teams up with preservationist Brett Waterman, star of DIY Network's Restored, and her husband and renovation partner Ken Pace to modernize dilapidated cabins and cottages that have been in families for generations. As Eve, Brett and Ken transform the well-loved but worn properties, they also give a nod to the homes' rich histories and ensure they will be enjoyed by future generations to come.",
