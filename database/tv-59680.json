  "overview": "The peaceful life of the residents of the coastal urbanization of Belmonte changes radically the day a sex video of Macarena, a school teacher, and Iván, one of her adult students, appears on the networks. This event shakes the lives of all of them, especially Macarena, who is disowned by her family and neighbors, including Ana, her best friend and Iván's mother. Things in the town get even more complicated when the lifeless body of one of Belmonte's inhabitants appears on the cliff. Whose body is it? Does this death have something to do with the sex video of the teacher and the student?",
