  "overview": "Born as identical beautiful twin girls with very different personalities and fate. Duen, the older twin, chose the fast lane of celebrity life. She is self-centered and selfish, while her sister, Pit, is cheerful, loves nature, and the simple country life. Unfortunately, Duen's fate started going down the slippery slope and was forced to live in a brothel. Though separate, their lives intertwined in a web of deception and lies. They may share the same genes, but their fate and end are not the same as they are two of a different kind.Â ",
