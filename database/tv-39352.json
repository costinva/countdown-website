  "overview": "The only quiz in the world where the contestants decide how much time they have to answer the questions...What takes longer - unwrapping every Werther's Original in a family pack, completing a Rubik's cube underwater or deflating an air bed and putting it back into its original box?These are the kinds of scenarios the contestants must choose from as timers on BBC One's Saturday teatime gameshow, The Time It Takes. The challenger who gets the most questions right in their given timescale will be one step closer to winning a dream holiday. But do not fret dear viewers, all is not completely lost for the player with the lowest score, as they will receive a very special The Time It Takes tea-towel before leaving the show.",
