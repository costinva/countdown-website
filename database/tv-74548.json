  "overview": "Young single men and women come to Love School in search of true love. However, two real-life couples are hiding among them. If single people become a couple, they receive 10,000 dollars as a gesture of the show supporting them. However, the real couples, also called the mafia couples, try to thwart the single people's effort to find love. If a single person and another person of the mafia couples get matched up, the person from the mafia gets the prize money of 10,000 dollars. Sung Si Kyung, known as a master of love and for his diverse careers and sharp wit, Shindong, Soyou, and Lee Hye Sung will host the show, making witty talks and exciting guesses. A real variety show about love, which is entirely different from everything you've seen so far, will give the audience the thrill and fun of a drama unfolded by real-life couples mixed with singles. Look forward to seeing which couple will get the prize money and fruit of love!",
