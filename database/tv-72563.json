  "overview": "Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God chronicles the life and death of Amy Carlson, also known as \"Mother God,\" a self-proclaimed spiritual savior who promised an escape from the \"3D\" world via her online manifestos and live-streaming sessions. As her most fervent acolytes came to live with Amy, they cared for \"Mother God,\" whose health gradually declined. Amy's followers joined her in believing that her physical demise was the result of her taking on the pain of the world, and that her deterioration would ultimately lead to her evacuation by UFO and salvation for humanity. Told through the eyes of Amy's devotees, both former and still practicing, and constructed almost entirely from the cult's archival footage, the series captures the early boom of internet proselytizing and the perils of a conspiracy-driven faith.Â ",
