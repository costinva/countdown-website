  "overview": "The internet can be a great way to stay connected to those you love, but a single post can turn into the source of jealousy that incites a person to do the unthinkable. #Murder explores stories of social media gone horribly wrong. Just like Fatal Attraction, Justice By Any Means and For My Man, this new show dives deep into the true crime stories that take root online and spill tragically into real life.",
