  "overview": "Dirty Water is a new Scottish comedy that follows a rag tag group of cleaners that work for a low-rent cleaning company; The Eager Beavers. Jock (the immature leader), Kaitlin (smart, cynical, chain-smoker), Boab (charming loud mouth) and Crawford (mild mannered, eccentric optimist) as they continuously find themselves in sticky situations that will take much more than a mop to clean up.",
