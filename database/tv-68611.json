  "overview": "A family curse hangs over student Maxim Sotnikov. The dark forces that have been dormant in him for many years begin to awaken and can completely take over his consciousness if, before his 21st birthday, he does not meet a girl with a special sign on her body. A kind, sympathetic, well-mannered guy, he feels like two principles are now fighting inside him.",
