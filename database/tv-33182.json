  "overview": "Synnøve Skarbø, author of the book Synnøves System, loves to clean. In the TV series Norske rotehjem she will show Norway that the road to a neat mind goes through a tidy room. Together with a handyman and an interior designer she will help all types of people, in all types of relationships, in all types of homes, to get the chaos. In each program a new room is to be cleaned and structured, and the owners of the mess must be involved in the cleanup.",
