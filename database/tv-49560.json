  "overview": "\"Ponty\" - a humorous duel, where two comedians try to use jokes to \"roll up\" to a girl. The rule is simple: who is funnier-goes on a date with the guest of the release. But there is one obstacle: you will have to come up with jokes on the spot. In each issue, both the guest and the comedians are new.",
