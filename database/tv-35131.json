  "overview": "Already a phenomenon at only 19 years old, Ashlee Simpson is ready to take it to the next level. We'll follow Ashlee every step of the way, as she signs her first record deal, writes her songs, auditions her band and records her very first album. Aside from the process of making her album, Ashlee lets us in on her life, and her various relationships with friends, family and of course, boys. We see the break-up with her boyfriend and then watch, as it becomes a song on her album. From band practice to label meetings, to album cover shoots and everything in between, Ashlee gives us full access to the entire process, taking us through to the album release and the band's first time ever on stage together.",
