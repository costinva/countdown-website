  "overview": "Relationships and the dating game are exciting but sometimes overwhelming for everyone â€“ particularly for those on the autism spectrum. Just like neurotypical people, those on the spectrum have the same desire for intimacy and companionship as the rest of the population, but difficulties in social interaction are a key feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder, which makes finding a partner an often daunting and difficult experience. This affectionate and revealing series draws on relationship coaching to help young neuro-diverse people have a better chance of finding true love. In the fast paced and often confusing world of modern dating, Love on the Spectrum sets out to teach us all new lessons on love, intimacy and acceptance.",
