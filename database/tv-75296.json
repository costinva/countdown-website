  "overview": "The main characters of the series are an unremarkable medical student Vanya and a moody beauty Margo, with whom he is hopelessly in love. They meet at sea and accidentally spend the night together, but the poor guy, self-conscious about his appearance and extra pounds, has no chance of being favored by a rich and self-confident girl. Many years later, fate gives them a second chance. Now Ivan is a slender handsome man and a famous nutritionist, and Margo is a single mother who has lost her home and her usual wealth. Will they recognize each other and finally be able to start their relationship from scratch?",
