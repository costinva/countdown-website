  "overview": "This is the story of a young girl who fights with all her might to maintain her innate goodness despite the darkness around her. When Bahar witnesses her father's murder, she decides to prove that Aysun, her stepmother, is the killer. At the same time, the love between Bahar and Demir, who met just a few days before the tragic event, grows stronger. However, Aysun's obsessive attachment to Demir and her determination to win him at any cost make this love increasingly impossible. ",
