  "overview": "EmmyÂ®-nominated and eminently stylish, Judge Kevin Ross dishes out justice with a wink and a smile. He's a former L.A. Superior Court judge with over 60,000 cases under his belt, and he uses his razor wit to challenge assumptions and question the answers. Justice has never looked or sounded sharper than America's Court with Judge Ross.",
