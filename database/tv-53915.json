  "overview": "A story that follows aggressive cop Jiang Yue and good doctor Chen Yu Zhi as they support and redeem each other during troubled times. They are polar opposites - one kills while one heals. Jiang Yue Lou who heads the Jingcheng Police Station appears to be neither good nor evil. Smugglers tremble at the thought of him. While investigating an opium case in Hong Kong, Jiang Yue Lou encounters doctor Chen Yu Zhi. Chen Yu Zhi discovers that Jiang Yue Lou has manic depression. From his initial refusal to undergo treatment, Jiang Yue Lou eventually opens up to Chen Yu Zhi. Despite their values being as different as day and night, they become close friends. Meanwhile, warlord Zhan Jun Bai, tycoon Zhao Jing Ming and rogue gangster Zhou Huo continue to make trouble and even attempt to put Jiang Yue Lou to death. At this time, the secrets from the past also rise to the surface.",
