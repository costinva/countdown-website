  "overview": "Archie appears on stage in front of a theater full of (live-action) kids each week and introduces his Fun House and the star of the show, the Giant Jukebox.

The regular segments are \"How to Catch a Man\" with Big Ethel, \"Thunderbolt Theatre\" and \"Giant Jukebox Jokes.\" Semi-regular features include \"The Early Early Show,\" \"Betty's Diary,\" \"The Big, Big World of Sports\" with Coach Cleats, an inept trapeze act with Reggie and Moose; and more. Each episode has three songs performed by The Archies.",
