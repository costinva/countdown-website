  "overview": "There is a \"Yuriko-sama Legend\" which has been passed down for generations in Yurigahara High School. It is said that student with the name Yuriko will become \"Yuriko-sama\" who has an absolute power. Anyone who opposes \"Yuriko-sama\" will lead to unhappiness. However, only one student will get to become \"Yuriko-sama\". If there are multiple Yuriko in the school, these students will have to withdraw or transfer school until there is only one remaining Yuriko. First-year-student Yasaka Yuriko has been badly bullied by her classmates. One day, her best friend from another class, Shimakura Mizuki told her about the legend and asked, \"Would you like to be Yuriko-sama?\"",
