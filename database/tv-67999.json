  "overview": "Follows the lives of seven Indigenous students as they leave home to spend a year boarding at one of the oldest and most elite boarding schools in the country, Geelong Grammar. Wrestling with their conflicting identities as students move between boarding life and home life, it creates a historic record of one of Australia's key Indigenous education pathways and a complex portrait of what it is to be an Indigenous child in Australia today.",
