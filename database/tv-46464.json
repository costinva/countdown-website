His son, Ganato, is a legendary rocker of his time. Ganato's second son, Ao, is the only one born of a different mother amongst his siblings. Ao is an ex-delinquent but is actually a very kind-hearted young man.\"The riddle of the disappearing encyclopedia\", \"The child left behind and the book that could open holes\", \"The torn painting and the break in of the book archives\"; All the unbelievable incidents that happen at Shitamachi are somehow resolved by this somewhat eccentric family.",
