Air Crash Investigation uncovers the truth behind the most legendary aviation disasters, and every episode features eyewitness accounts, captivating reenactments, state-of-the-art CGI, and interviews with the investigators who ultimately determined what went wrong. On this bonus season of Air Crash Investigation, every episode examines multiple cases under a central theme: Rookie Errors reveals the minor mistakes behind some of the worst-ever airline disasters; Collision Course follows the scramble to prevent yet another midair impact; and, on Fuel Failures, a mysterious trail of clues ultimately leads to the fuel tank.",
