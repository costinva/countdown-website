  "overview": "Lars Monsen will do what he does best - surviving in the wilderness. He doesn't know where he is or where he's going, the only this he knows is that he has to get to the finish line within the deadline. Only this time he isn't alone. He will have no idea which celebrity will be joining him on the trip until the trip has already started.",
