We meet the under 35s who go out to have a good time but a terrible turn in events leads to their murders.This UK series uses intimate, down-the-lens interviews with family members, friends, and key figures from the investigation team to tell the stories of these tragic deaths. Blending CCTV footage, social media posts and home movies, each episode forensically pieces together the narrative of their last night out.",
