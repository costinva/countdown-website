  "overview": "Addicted to Food follows eight eating disorder patients (both over and under eaters) at treatment facility Shades of Hope as they work to put the pieces of their lives back together. The focus of this series is not the weight loss, but the underlying struggles of their past that have prevented them from overcoming their food addiction. Tennie McCarty, Shades of Hope founder and therapist, works directly with each patient to help them face their past so they can take positive steps toward their future.",
