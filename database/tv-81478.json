  "overview": "At all times, people are divided into those who do something to change the world around them and those who say there is no point in resisting. A tsunami is an untamable phenomenon. You can build a breakwater, but it will pass by and wash everything away. But when creating the world God gave humanity hope and a way to protect itself against the ocean that can be so destructive... Mangrove. It is a tree that does not have the majesty of an oak or a sequoia. On the contrary, it is a gnarled tree, with crooked, towering roots that rise out of the water. But mangroves are the barrier that saves humanity from the tyranny of tsunamis. At a time when the invasion from russia was about to inevitably crush Ukraine, bleeding and disarmed, ordinary people stood in its way. People who decided that their lives and the future of our country depended on them. They are saving the country, even at the cost of their lives. While the whole world is watching, they are doing the impossible!",
