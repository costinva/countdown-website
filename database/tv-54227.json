  "overview": "Oblivious. Crude. Selfish. These aren't the qualities that you'd expect from a life coach, but then again, former NBA All-Star Baron Davis isn't your average guy.Introducing WTF Baron Davis, Fuse's newest show, starring…well, Baron Davis as a slightly fictionalized version of himself. The irreverent show follows the exploits of the retired baller as he provides \"mentorship\" to an eclectic assortment of characters, starting with his newest mentee, B-Dot. Oh and he's also trying to navigate his own ridiculous life and post-retirement fame.",
