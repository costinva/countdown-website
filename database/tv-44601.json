  "overview": "Dinosaur fossils hitherto discovered account only for 1% of all the dinosaurs that ever walked (or flew, or swam) the Earth. But in the last decade or so, findings in the remaining 99% have accelerated, adding brilliant color -- literally -- to their world. Based on the latest research, this two-part series recreates in gorgeous CGI not only what these creatures looked like, but also how they lived, fought, and died.",
