  "overview": "Tails is not a white-collar gentlemen's club. It's a borderline-legal bar with topless dancers and a back room where anything goes for the right price. Nick, the owner, keeps Tails afloat by taking advantage of the desperate women who dance for money and the desperate men who pay for female attention. When a dead body shows up in the bathroom, Nick's control begins to unravel. Hunted by an ambitious, relentless cop, Nick's enemies begin to surround him. He must decide how many friends to sacrifice in order to save himself.",
