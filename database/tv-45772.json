  "overview": "Bai Qi is a mysterious doctor who rents Lin Xia's house for his medical practice. As his landlady living upstairs, Lin Xia notices some strange things about him. He doesn't accept money as payment for his service. Instead, he asks his patients for the most valuable thing to them. His patients come from all walks of life, and some are not even human, which is not surprising, because neither is Bai Qi.Â ",
