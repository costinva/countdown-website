  "overview": "What begins as an exploration into the mysterious circumstances surrounding Crystal Rogers, a mother of five vanishing from the tiny town of Bardstown, Kentucky, quickly spirals into the dissection of multiple unsolved homicides haunting this idyllic, heartland community. Presumed dead and the victim of foul play, it has been over two years and there have been no arrests made in Crystal's case. Additionally, Crystal's father, Tommy Ballard, who was conducting his own 16-month investigation into his daughter's disappearance, was shot down and died, leaving a box of clues behind.",
