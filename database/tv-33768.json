  "overview": "Everyone has a bucket list of things to accomplish in their lifetime. They usually look a bit like this: hike the Appalachian Trail, visit Graceland, go on a New Orleans ghost tour, get pulled onto stage at a Vegas magic show â€“ but Chef Todd Fisher hungers for experiences with a bit more meat to them. As a life-long restaurateur, Chef Todd's passion for palate pleasers has him questing for the best bacon, burgers, and steaks at not just eateries, but meat temples, across the nation in Destination America's new original series United States of Food.",
