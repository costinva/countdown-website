  "overview": "Outrageous Food is the Food Network series that follows The Next Food Network Star finalist Tom Pizzica as he travels the country on the hunt for big tastes. Tom hits the road on a mission to find jaw-dropping, eye-popping and heart stopping foods that will shock your eyes and taste buds. From the crazy spicy Ninja sushi roll that has wasabi oil, cayenne, and habaneros to the $175 dollar hamburger, all the way to corn-on-the-cob flavored ice cream. He sees outrageous culinary feats like a five foot pizza that needs to be delivered by a crane, a behemoth breakfast weighing in at five pounds, the burger with two dozen toppings and spicy vodka infused hot wings. Tom's years of experience working in kitchens combined with his passion for food and fun attitude lead to some food adventures that you have to see to believe.",
