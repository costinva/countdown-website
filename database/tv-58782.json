  "overview": "Prakan Pitakjiti is one of the most amazing surgeons in the hospital. He has a special gift which is the ability to see the angel of death. He called him Tua-Phee because he always shows up in the surgery room with a white ticket and it means that his patient won't survive any longer. Tua-Phee becomes the person who Prakan want to meet the least because his presence means his failure to save people. However, faith brings them together as it turns out that Tua-Phee is living next-door.",
