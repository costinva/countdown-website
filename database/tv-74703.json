  "overview": "Barcelona's sea port receives almost 6.000 containers per day. Goods from all over the world which, in just a year, can hide over 30.000 kilos of cocaine, making the port city one of Europe's most important entrances in the profitable business of drug trafficking. Joaquin Manchado knows well, he is the owner of the main terminal in the port of Barcelona. If someone wants to import an illegal load through the port they need to count with his support as well as the collaboration of all the criminal network he has shaped around him. However, an unexpected accident and the disappearance of an important load of cocaine will unchain a ruthless war riddled with murders and revenges.",
