  "overview": "Home cooks from across the country will compete to see who has what it takes to join the coveted America's Test Kitchen team. Each of the 11 contestants competing will present their dishes throughout a series of challenges that test their culinary abilities and on-camera personality. Each week, the contestants will stand in front of the judges' panel. The last cook standing will get the job of a lifetimeâ€”becoming the newest face of America's Test Kitchen, the opportunity to write their own cookbook, and a $100,000 prize to fund the culinary business of their dreams.",
