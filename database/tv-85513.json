To uncover the truth behind her father's wrongful accusation, she navigates a dangerous game between two brothersâ€”Sheng, who shifts from ruthless possession to deep love, and Dai Shiyao, whose suspicion turns to passion. As war reignites, the trio defies fate: Sheng abandons violence for love, Dai Shiyao sacrifices love for duty, and Qin Shiyue finally finds both truth and rebirth amidst the bloodshed.",
