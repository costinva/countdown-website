  "overview": "A talent show, whose participants demonstrate their unique abilities to the entire country. The project's motto is not to lose heart and remain bright and unrivaled, despite difficult times. In each qualifying round, 11 participants will fight for a place in the final. And only if all jury members approve of the performance and all three stars light up, the participant goes further. Each jury member has a golden button. Only once during the entire project, they can use it to let a participant through to the final, for whom not all the judges voted, and give him a chance to earn the main prize - three million rubles. In the first qualifying round: pancake juggling, push-ups on nails, fingerboarding, tongue twisters and much more.",
