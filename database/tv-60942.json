  "overview": "Family drama set in the quaint town of Sag Harbor, known as \"The Black Hamptons,\" in Long Island, NY. From luxury communities to historic beachfront enclaves, this epic story will follow the brewing feud between the ‘Brittons' and the ‘Johnsons,' where the difference between old and new money is very apparent. Carl Weber's The Black Hamptons not only features the glitz and gloss of the Black elite but also exposes the underbelly of wealth and prestige. With a mix of legacy families thriving for generations, friends, wannabes, and thirsty developers, drama can never be too far behind. ",
