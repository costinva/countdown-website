  "overview": "45 дней до Победы is a project dedicated to the heroic deeds of people during the Great Patriotic War. Pioneer partisans, scientists of besieged Leningrad, signalmen, artists, athletes, nurses, translators, priests - none of them were ready for war, but each made an invaluable contribution to bringing the long-awaited Victory closer. Each episode reflects one year of a terrible period for the country - from the beginning of the invasion to the final defeat of the enemy in 1945.",
