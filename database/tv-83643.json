  "overview": "Zhou Nanfeng travels back in time through a diary, arriving just before Qin Zhiyi's marriage falls apart, hoping to stop Zhong Ziye from seeking revenge on her. As their fates become entangled across timelines, Zhong Ziye relentlessly follows, manipulating events to create misunderstandings and drive a wedge between Zhou Nanfeng and Qin Zhiyi. But when Zhong Ziye unexpectedly dies and Zhou Nanfeng sacrifices himself to protect Qin Zhiyi, she finally uncovers the truth about the time travel. Using the diary once more, she journeys back again â€“ only to realize that everything traces back to Zhong Ziye's love for Song Xingyue. As the four become trapped in an endless cycle of fate, love and hate intertwine, and the truth becomes ever more elusive, shrouded in blood and destiny.",
