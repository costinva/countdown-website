  "overview": "Join Anne Hjern√∏e and Anders Agger on an adventurous journey through the Nordic countries. Once upon a time, many years ago, there was one great kingdom. Today we dream again of the Nordic feeling. From the ice sheet to the Russian border. In the first program, Anne and Anders visit the Faroe Islands. Here in the middle of the North Atlantic, the abandoned outskirts have become hip fronts and the traditions are something that can both be smelled and tasted.",
