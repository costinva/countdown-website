  "overview": "Tommy \"Little Dog\" Ross gets the chance to re-enter the boxing ring after walking away from the ring during a championship bout five years ago. Tommy decides to make a comeback, and many of the obstacles that he needs to hurdle are psychological in nature -- including his girlfriend being with his rival. His family members focus on their own issues, which may be in direct competition to everything that Tommy is trying to achieve.",
