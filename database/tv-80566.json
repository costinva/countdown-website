  "overview": "Though history has long lionised its great leaders and early rulers, being an elite wasn't all glory and prosperity. Even the fiercest General and the most enduring Monarch would be confronted by opposition and upheaval. Some learned the hard way that power is far from absolute, and allegiance, always conditional. Revolutions That Changed History exposes the complex truth behind ancient revolutions and revolts, from the epic, action-packed, bloody battlegrounds to the intimate exchanges between confidants that were powerful enough to turn tides. Episodes include Wat Tyler's Rebellion (Peasant's Revolt), Boudica's Revolt, French Revolution, Third Servile War, American Revolution and Decembrist Revolt. ",
