  "overview": "In First to the End of the World, host Martin Johnsrud Sundby gives an epic challenge to four participating couples: they will embark on a 6,000-kilometer race from Marrakesh in Morocco to the End of the World in Norway, and they must get there without boarding a single plane. Without a mobile phone, and with a limited budget, the couples must navigate their way from Morocco via Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Austria and Germany, before finally reaching the finish line in Norway.",
