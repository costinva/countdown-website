  "overview": "A program in which seven traumatized war veterans combat their post-traumatic stress disorder. Those seven veterans have served their fatherland in countries like Kosovo, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq and Cambodia. They try to learn how to live with their disorder during a mentally heavy and physical journey through one of the many fjords in Norway. At the end of their journey, the veterans are brought back home in which they have to transform those lessons into real life situations.",
