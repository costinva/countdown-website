  "overview": "Pride Fighting Championships was a Japanese based MMA promotion that ran from 1997 to 2007. Pride ran over 60 events including a co-production with K-1 boasting the largest ever live MMA attendance record in 2002. Pride differed from American MMA, using a five roped ring as opposed to a cage, a three round fifteen minute fight format, and a unique rule set allowing for a greater variety of strikes, stomps and spikes.",
