When a developer covets the land to build a marina, a family of eccentric musicians persists in thwarting his plans: the owner Antoine, fighting against his brilliant saxophonist son Theo, and Sika, a young singer whose outstanding talent will bring a new meaning to her life as well as second wind to the band.",
