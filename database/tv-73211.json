  "overview": "From the mind of Adam Carolla, Mr. Birchum is a no-nonsense, junior high woodshop teacher who is attempting to navigate a world he doesn't understand or approve of. He's befuddled by his gaming streamer son, Eddie, annoyed at his selfie-taking, snowflake students and is constantly at war with the school district's appointed \"J.E.D.I.\" (Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion officer) Mr. Karponzi.",
