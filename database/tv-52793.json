Starring the brilliant Mikhail Efremov, Oksana Akinshina, Nikita Efremov and Pavel Tabakov. Many of us live on autopilot and do not think about whether everything suits them in our lives. The employees of the legal department of a Moscow construction company were little different from the rest, until one canceled flight forces them to change their views on their own lives. Someone decides to reconsider their marriage, another returns to a rebellious lifestyle, and a third tries to finally get over the guilt and give himself a second chance. After all, life is one, and how to live it, everyone decides for himself!",
