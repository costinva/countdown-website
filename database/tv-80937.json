  "overview": "Like everyone else, Iris has a head. Only her head... isn't exactly like everyone else's. And neither is her mouth, which says things that other mouths don't say. Her boyfriend, her cousin, a wine merchant, a museum guard. The list of those she pushes to the limit grows every day. But ultimately, the first to suffer is Iris.",
