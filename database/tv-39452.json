  "overview": "Each episode of Discovery Channel's all-new six-part series Mega Beasts is a detective story, bringing back to life some of the biggest and most ferocious dinosaurs ever to roam the earth. Through fossil clues and modern analogues (animals with similar traits used to suggest the mega beasts' behavior), scientists piece together what these mysterious creatures looked like, how they behaved, how they fought, what they ate...and what ate them. With the use of cutting-edge CGI, these enormous beasts are put in modern day scenarios to demonstrate what they would look and act like if they still roamed the planet today.",
