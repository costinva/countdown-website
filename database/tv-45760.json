  "overview": "Jonas Waldek has gained a lot of experience as a ranger in the Canadian forests in the past five years. Returning to his home town of Stadt Wehlen and the Saxon Switzerland National Park, he has been working with his new colleagues for a few months now to ensure the preservation of the unique landscape and wildlife. A constant tightrope walk between nature conservation and economic interests, because the whole region lives from tourism. However, as a ranger, Jonas is not only the guardian and protector of this unique natural region, he always has to deal with acute emergencies in the national park, which he copes with great commitment and empathy.",
