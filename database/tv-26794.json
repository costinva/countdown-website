  "overview": "Set in Toronto during the 1920s, Frankie Drake Mysteries follows the city's only female private detective as she takes on the cases the police don't want or can't handle. Her gender is her biggest advantage - who would ever think a woman could be a detective? She has a knack for solving cases but she's no cop - her brand of justice doesn't always follow the law. Along with her partner Trudy, Frankie and the Drake Detective Agency take on cases of all shapes and sizes. From airplanes and booze running to American G-men, Communists and union busters, Frankie's fearless sense of adventure gets her into all kinds of trouble, but she always manages to find her way out. In a time of change and hopefulness, Frankie is a woman ahead of everyone. She's a new detective for a new world. But is the world ready for her?",
