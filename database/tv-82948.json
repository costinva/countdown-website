  "overview": "Professional riders Ryan Peatry and Alexey Vermuelen both agree that cycling sports need to be more accessible and inclusive. Peatry, a mountain biker, and Vermuelen, a road cyclist, recognize the barriers beginner cyclists face when it comes to buying gear, training, and finding the motivation to race competitively. They've made it their mission to help new cyclists surmount those obstacles, and in Outside TV's new series From the Ground Up they work to show that anyone with enough determination can race with the pros.",
