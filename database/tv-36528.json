  "overview": "In a not very distant future an evil group called Black Widows has released an infectious bacteria across the world that enslaves the human mind. This biological agent has spread in a spiral pattern around the globe and now covers nearly half of the Earth. The infected areas have been labeled the Spiral Zone and the people who are infected called Zoners, mindless slaves under the control of the Widows. To fight the Black Widows an international team of elite soldiers known as the Zone Riders has been assembled by the nations of the Free World. The Zone Raders have been selected for their exceptional skills from armies around the world. In special suits that protect them from the infectious bacteria, the Zone Raiders battle to free the entire world from the dominion of the Black Widows and their zone of evil.",
