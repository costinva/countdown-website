  "overview": "An audacious tale of two roommates, one a homosexual man and another a heterosexual woman. Through the eyes of Mi Ae begins Go Yeong's clumsy love story. Stories of laughter, tears, and wounds between a mother in denial of his gender identity and a lover unable to escape societal judgment. Go Yeong finally meets a pure love like no other, Gyu Ho, but has no choice but to let him go. With Gyu Ho gone, Go Yeong follows a stranger to Thailand and spends a late monsoon vacation. Reminiscing about the good old days that can never be retrieved, he achieves complete personal growth.",
