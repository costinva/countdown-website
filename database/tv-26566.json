  "overview": "Over the course of five seasons, fans have watched Vanessa and Angela Simmons grow up before their eyes on Run's House. Now, with the premiere of Daddy's Girls, viewers can watch the sisters take a step toward independence as they make a permanent move to Los Angeles to set up a west coast office and showroom for their wildly successful pastry tennis shoe and apparel line, and so Vanessa can pursue her acting career. They might be 3000 miles away from home, but the lessons their father, Rev Run, has instilled are with them always... and the Rev is just a phone call away! Daddy's Girls will also introduce viewers to two new faces, cousin and business associate Jessica and friend, Aliceia. Together, the four girls are determined to make it in Los Angeles with the Rev guiding them along the way.",
