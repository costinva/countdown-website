  "overview": "It's the most frequently asked question from fans of Forged in Fire—\"When will we see bladesmiths compete against our judges?\" Now, they are about to get their wish. In each episode, previous Forged in Fire Champions return to the forge for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—to square off against our renowned Forged in Fire Masters in the highest stakes forging competition yet! The challenges require higher skillsets and there are more tests to pass. First, the smiths must prove they have what it takes to challenge an icon by beating each other in a series of win-or-go-home forging challenges. The remaining two smiths will then compete with one of our seasoned Judges to create a fully functioning blade that will be evaluated and tested. If the challenger can find a way to prevail against our Judge in an intense bladesmithing showdown, they'll walk away with $10K and eternal bragging rights.",
