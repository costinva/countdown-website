  "overview": "This supersized, adult version of Legends of the Hidden Temple is taken out of the studio into a \"jungle\" and scaled up with tougher challenges and much bigger prizes on the line. It preserves the original Nickelodeon series' favorite elements including: \"Olmec\" (the giant talking Mayan head), the\"Moat Crossings,\" \"The Steps of Knowledge,\" the \"Temple Run,\" and of course, the iconic team names: \"Purple Parrots,\" \"Blue Barracudas,\" \"Orange Iguanas,\" \"Red Jaguars,\" \"Silver Snakes\" and \"Green Monkeys.\" Every episode is a hero's journey through a mysterious jungle. Five teams begin the journey, but only one is \"strong enough and smart enough\" to enter the ominous Olmec's Temple, avoid the \"dreaded\" Temple Guards, retrieve a lost treasure, and return it to its rightful owner.",
