  "overview": "Çatı Katı Aşk begins with the addition of two foreign guests in a large and warm family. Ateş and Yasemin, who joined this family, living with solidarity and holding onto each other, with a tiny \"lie\", will have their first encounter with love under this roof, and then they'll be tested with their lies, but over time they will experience friendship, the act of sharing and most importantly, love. Çatı Katı Aşk is actually the story of those who have just made it into life, those who carry the struggles of this world on their backs. Those who knit their nest one after the other. But above all, it is a love story. A story about characters who are culturally and socially from each other as they try to resist the love they feel for the sake of their families. While life has left these young characters with such a heavy burden to carry, will this strongly-bonded family be able to overcome all the difficulties and stay united?",
