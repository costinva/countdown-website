  "overview": "It's all about being \"business in the front, party in the back\" when it comes to the Mullet brothers, two siblings who sport the same haircut but are actually very different from each other. Dwayne is loud and has an in-your-face demeanor, while brother Denny is quieter and easygoing. The guys' mother has recently married a clean-cut game show host who is the polar opposite of Dwayne and Denny.",
