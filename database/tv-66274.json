  "overview": "In the Alps, the resort of Les Clairies celebrates the victory of its downhill champion, Boris Arnoux, darling of the country. The party is in full swing when a fire breaks out further down the valley, in a makeshift camp. A caravan burns, enclosing in its flames a poorly housed seasonal worker. This \"accident\" is the starting point of an investigation led by Emilie Karras, a young policeman from Lyon, originally from Les Clairies where she grew up but whom she also left 12 years ago to save herself. She is forced to stay and collaborate with Major Servoz, a disillusioned local policeman. They will discover the twists and turns of this resort swallowed up by a luxurious real estate project that divides people as much as it stares at the mountain.",
