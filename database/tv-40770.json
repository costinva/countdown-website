  "overview": "In each episode, a giant ice cream truck arrives with a new theme and mystery ingredient that the contestants must translate into a uniquely delicious ice cream dessert - before time runs out. Contestants must survive three heart-pounding challenges that would leave any top dessert professional screaming over ice cream, with a rotating panel of judges, including Duff Goldman, Doug Quint, Zac Young, Nancy Silverton, Johnny Iuzzini, Paulette Goto, and Natasha Case determining who advances in each round and scoops up the grand prize of $10,000. In the end, only one will be named the first-ever King of Cones.",
