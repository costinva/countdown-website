  "overview": "Tokunoshima Airport follows an air traffic controller at a small airport in Tokunoshima, an island near Kagoshima Prefecture where there are only 4 flights per day. As such, the drama focuses on how the air traffic controllers there battle with boredom rather than the busy lives led by their Tokyo counterparts.",
