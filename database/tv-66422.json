  "overview": "Four generations of a Jewish family live under one roof in the center of Moscow. And although the Abramovichi live very close to the synagogue, all of them, with the exception of old Musi Lvovna, are very far from Jewish traditions, religion and self-consciousness. Borya sells (and eats) pork, unsuccessfully trying to succeed in business, his son David hides his origin, and his wife Alla does not even suspect how much she looks like a real aidisha mother.But everything changes one day when a lightning bolt hits Borya, who is running away from the collectors. When he comes to himself, he gets acquainted with the spirit of his ancestor — the harmful old man Chaim. Once Chaim committed a terrible sin and brought a curse on their entire family. Only Borya can remove it from the Abramovich family, but for this it is necessary to free Chaim's soul.",
