  "overview": "The struggle for existence is about the linguist Tomasz Novak (28) traveling from Warsaw to Norway to collect what he believes is a quick buck from a father he has never met. His project is proving to take time and along the way he becomes ever more integrated in the Norwegian society, represented by a privileged and well-meaning group of citizens, which in turn gives us a picture of the current Norwegian life.",
