  "overview": "Set in the fly metropolis of Stickyfeet, The Buzz on Maggie takes viewers into the daily life of flies, seen from the point of view of Maggie, an unusually creative and expressive tween fly. Maggie is fun-loving, highly energetic and thinks outside the box, but ruffles antennae with her inspired antics in the conventional, hard-working world of upstanding flies. When she is faced with one of the many routines of everyday life, Maggie devises a way to make it fresh and exciting and before long, she puts her exuberant, can-do attitude to work on translating her inspiration into reality but her actions inevitably upset the balance of the world around her and have consequences she doesn't anticipate.",
