  "overview": "Poor old Billy Bleach. One minute he's at his Thai cookery class and the next minute he's in the witness protection programme. When Billy witnesses the gangland killing of a local nightclub owner, he has no choice but to go into police protection if he wants to escape ruthless gang boss, Harry Taylor - and prison. Leaving his beloved East London, he is carted off to a small country village (he was hoping for the Florida Keys) where he has to become a completely different person. He is rigorously trained in his new identity, ready to face the world as Peter Jones - a poet. Will Billy be able to pass himself off as someone completely new?",
