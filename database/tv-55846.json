  "overview": "FBoy Island follows three women who move to a tropical paradise where they're joined by 26 menâ€”13 self-proclaimed \"Nice Guys\" looking for love, and 13 self-proclaimed \"Fboys,\" there to compete for cold, hard cash. The women will navigate the dating pool together with the hope of finding a lasting love connection. By the finale, all will be revealed: who is a Nice Guy, who is an FBoy, who the women ultimately choose, and who walks away with the prize money. FBoy Island is a social experiment that asks: Can FBoys truly reform or do Nice Guys always finish last?",
