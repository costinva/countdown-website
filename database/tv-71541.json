  "overview": "Based on the first-hand experiences of a long serving witness protection officer, Protection is about what happens when the system breaks down. It's about a police officer, Detective Inspector Liz Nyles, who finds herself at the heart of such a breach; personally compromised by an affair with a colleague, but determined to fight back, and uncover the true source of corruption within her unit. To redeem herself, the reputation of her lover, and to keep her witnesses safe. Even if they don't always deserve it.Navigating the morally-grey, clandestine world of witness protection, Liz's mission to find the truth will take her deep into the heart of the criminal underbelly and beyond as she becomes more and more torn between caring for her family, her loyalty to her lover and her duty as a police officer.Â ",
