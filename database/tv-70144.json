  "overview": "The viewers try to stick a fine team made up of personalities of the media, journalists, writers, humorists or politicians, by asking them questions of general culture. Each viewer who succeeds in trapping the members with his question leaves with 300 euros. If the tape finds the answer, the 300 euros are added to a jackpot that a viewer drawn at random can win at the end of the program, if he discovers what the mystery image represents.",
