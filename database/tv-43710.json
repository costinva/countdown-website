  "overview": "Morocco from Above is a documentary by the French photographer, journalist and environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand. It is shot exclusively from the sky, created to occasion the UN climate conference COP22 in Marrakesh in November 2016. The documentary leads us on a journey of discovery across this wonderful country from a brand new point of view. Morocco, as a gigantic fresco, is elaborated on through visits to the flagship sites of the country, providing us a history of the territories and human activy. The camera carries us from one picture to another, from the dry coast to the fields with industrial complexes, from the cities to small villages. Each time, several visions are combined and intermingled, putting forward a unique physical geography, full of diversity: nature, the earth, the fields, cultures, wadis and valleys, mountains, the dry and the green of the plains, cereals as well as durum wheatâ€¦ What the sky lets us discover is how a country's wealth is with no doubt coming from its land and from the humans working on it. Morocco From Above with Adam Liaw is an English narrated version produced for Australian television's renowned culturally diverse broadcaster SBS.",
