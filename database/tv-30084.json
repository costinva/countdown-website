  "overview": "Every murder leaves behind haunting questions for the victim's loved ones. Why did this happen to my daughter? How did he end up in that part of town? Are they in a better place now? Unfortunately, those questions are left to haunt those left behind... until now. Cell Block Psychic introduces Vicki Monroe, a psychic medium who believes that a closed case doesn't mean closure. In this limited three-part series, Investigation Discovery delves into the paranormal phenomena of communicating with spirits, and bringing real answers to grieving families. Each episode follows Monroe's investigation into a homicide, anchored by heart-wrenching sessions where Monroe communicates with the murder victim in the presence of their loved ones to decipher their final messages from beyond the grave. To provide a complete understanding of the crime, Monroe also travels behind prison walls to talk to the spirits around the stone-cold killers who have been convicted for the crimes. Receiving answers to questions that only the victim and the killer would know, Monroe is able to piece together what happened before, during, and after a murder. Monroe's otherworldly insights have helped close cold cases and solve high profile investigations, as she works to get answers from beyond to bring closure to suffering families. These are the true stories of murders, as told by the victims themselves.",
