  "overview": "Adelaide in South Australia is a city of arts, culture, sport and magnificent old churches. It's also accused of being the murder capital of the world â€“ with more serial killers, per capita, than anywhere else.It's a macabre reputation the city can't shake, and barely scratches the surface of what Adelaide truly is. City of Evil outlines grotesque criminal cases and explains why Adelaide is seen as Australia's happy hunting ground of bizarre crime.",
