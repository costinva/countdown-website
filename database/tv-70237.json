  "overview": "In Celebrity Race Across the World four celebrities and their racing partners will race to a finish line that's thousands of miles away â€“ without the use of air travel or any trappings of modern-day life. Stripped of all mod-cons and all luxuries they will have to rely on their skills, cunning, ingenuity, and hard work in order to succeed. Without the use of credit cards, smartphones or access to the internet and with just the cash equivalent of completing the route to their final destination by air, they will have to earn extra money along the way as well as call upon the kindness of strangers to help them progress. This incredible journey will give a unique insight into the celebrities and their relationships with their travelling companions.",
