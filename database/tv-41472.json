  "overview": "Hundreds of years ago, the Chinese Zodiac spirits and their gods swore to stay together eternally. United by this promise, the possessed members of the Souma shall always return to each other under any circumstances. Yet, when these bonds shackle them from their freedom, it becomes an undesirable burden - a curse. As head of the clan, Akito is convinced that he shares a special connection with the other Soumas. While he desperately clings to this fantasy, the rest of the family remains isolated and suppressed by the fear of punishment.Â Tooru Honda, who as grown attached to the Soumas, is determined to break the chains that bind them. The companionship with her family and her friends encourages her to move forward with lifting the curse. However, due to confounding revelations, she struggles to find the tenacity to continue with her endeavours. With time slowly withering away, Tooru contends with an uncertain furture in hopes of reaching tranquility that may lie beyond all this commotion.There is also Fruits Basket: Prologue, a theatrical release movie that provides a prologue story and an epilogue after the TV anime.",
