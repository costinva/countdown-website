  "overview": "John Bishop embarks on a once-in-a-lifetime, 600 mile road trip around the Emerald Isle, taking a deep dive into Irish culture. It's a rollicking and hilarious voyage that will not only follow John discovering iconic sights and quirky customs, but will also see him perform his comedy along the way, from a small and cramped gig in a Limerick pub, through to the biggest stage in all of Ireland.The show will capture every moment of his journey around this extraordinary and varied land, from long days on the road, to pre-gig jitters and his encounters with a colourful cast of larger-than-life locals.",
