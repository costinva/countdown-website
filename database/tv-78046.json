  "overview": "The Hungry Games: Alaska's Big Bear Challenge puts a playful competition spin on the bears of Alaska's Katmai National Park as they bulk up for winter hibernation. Over 150 days, the bears battle the elements - and each other - using brains and brawn to consume three million calories and gain up to 200 pounds in Nature's real-life survival show. Unbeknownst to the bears, their progress is being tracked and ranked for a television audience with narration that combines fascinating facts about bear behavior with clever color commentary.",
