  "overview": "A city dweller's dream: leave the big smoke for the Suffolk countryside, establish a farm specialising in rare pigs, and make a living producing the finest sausages money can buy. This series follows 28-year-old Essex boy Jimmy Doherty as he attempts to turn such a dream into reality - only he knows nothing about pigs, takes the risk of borrowing Â£55,000 and, to the dismay of his girlfriend and parents, buys a ruin of a farm with no water or electricity. He then turns to his city friends for help. The results are what nightmares are made of. ",
