  "overview": "The great thing about The Surreal Life is that every season the cast is always an odd but incredibly compelling mix of celebrities, everyone from A-Listers all the way down to... well, not A-Listers. The hierarchy of the casts' fame and the question of the level of each person's celebrity always seems to come into question. Well, now it's time for those questions to be answered and find out who is more famous than whom in the first ever Surreal Life All-Star Challenge! The Surreal Life All-Star Challenge is a show where 12 cast members from previous seasons of The Surreal Life will compete against each other in a fun and out-of-control elimination-style contest to see which celebrity is the most famous of them all! Throughout this 10-episode challenge, the celebrities will constantly fluctuate between the A-List, the B-List and the dreaded \"Thanks for playing, see you later\"- List, but by the competition's end, only one celebrity will remain to claim the grand prize of $100,000, bragging rights and the title of the most famous Surreal Life All-Star!",
