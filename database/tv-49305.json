  "overview": "As we all stay home to stay safe together, what we're missing most is connecting with other people out in the world. And for Colman Domingo (Fear the Walking Dead, Zola, Candyman) that primarily means… brunch. A writer, actor and director in Los Angeles, Colman has friends across all parts of the entertainment industry and beyond. But before he was on stage and screen, he worked in the service industry — and that love of bar and restaurant life has never left him. He even owns his own bar now, The Wolves in downtown LA. Keeping with that love of bar life and that need to connect, he's taking it virtual. Each week, he'll send a couple of friends all the mixings for a cocktail of choice, have them make something delicious and invite them to brunch... and he's inviting you too. And if the exact ingredients aren't available, don't sweat it – Colman is used to improvising so he'll help make the best of whatever his guests (and you) have available. We all have to adapt in these wacky new times, including cocktail time.",
