But Will faces a major obstacle: he is unable to cast even the most basic spell. This forces him to fight monsters in dungeons to earn credits at the Regarden Magic Academy where he studies. Despite his lack of talent in magic, Will is blessed with exceptional sword skills, inherited from his mysterious past. At the heart of the Magic Academy, where strength and magic reign supreme, Will Serfort must navigate dangerous challenges and rivalries, while searching for a way to unlock his hidden magical potential.",
