  "overview": "Tyler Florence brings together five of a city's most talented chefs to battle it out in a restaurant they've never cooked in before. Through a game of chance, two of these local chefs become the judges and the other three compete to become the hometown champ. The competing chefs must incorporate secret ingredients into their dishes, and they also have access to whatever else they can find in the restaurant's kitchen. When five of the hottest chefs from the same city are pitted against each other, the result is fierce competition, explosive rivalry and intense hometown pride in the quest to be named their city's Bite Club Champ.",
