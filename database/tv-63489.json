  "overview": "Good Bones: Risky Business will feature Mina boldly going solo to purchase the historic Sanders House in the Indianapolis neighborhood of Fountain Square. More than a century old, the 7,000 square-foot property - which includes the main home and a carriage house - will be the largest project Mina has ever tackled in terms of size and budget and will require precise restoration to return it to its former glory.",
