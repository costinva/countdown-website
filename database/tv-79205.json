She's a little girl with very big ideas. When Rita is faced with everyday problems, she imagines fantastical characters to help her – a super-sorting robot, a ferocious dragon, a fairy godmother, a wicked witch, a sneaky ninja and a wish-granting genie. But fantastical characters bring fantastical mayhem with dire and often hilarious consequences for Rita and those around her… Rita will have kids thinking differently about the problems they face every day. The series is presented by the author herself with animations based on the illustrations from the books. These stories are bursting with fun and mischief, but their ‘be-kind-to-ourselves' wisdom is gentle and true. Rita's ninja moves, her dragon-taming and her magic carpet-flying throw a new light on real-world challenges such as sharing with siblings, emotional regulation and tidying up. ",
