  "overview": "Border Interceptors follows the work of the men and women who protect Ireland's borders on a daily basis. From dealing with the millions people who travel through Irish airports as they visit the Emerald Isle ever year to making sure everything is above board with the millions of tonnes of goods that arrive and leave Irish shores every year, from ensuing the safety of people along Ireland's 3000 kilometres of coastline to keeping a watchful eye over the vehicles crossing back and forth along the nearly 500 kilometres of land board with the UK. Filming in multiple locations throughout Ireland we'll capture the frontline work of the numerous agencies who protect Ireland's boarders.",
