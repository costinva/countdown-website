  "overview": "Renat Agzamov is a legend in the world of confectioners. His cakes are works of art, only first-class professionals work in his team. But the path to the sweet business is saturated with bitter tears. In the Confectioner program, not a single failure and not a single mistake goes unpunished, because in his kitchen Agzamov is a cruel but fair dictator.Harsh criticism, but an honest assessment of Renat will force some confectioners to change their tactics, recipes and serving. \"Confectioner\" will show a real caramel-waffle battle!",
