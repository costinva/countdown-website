  "overview": "The new daily series from RTL, Infernal Relatives, is a thrilling story about how rival families in a small town battle for money, power, and love.Everything is ready for the construction of a battery factory on the outskirts of Pantallós—if István Fejes allows it. The town's mayor, Tihamér Aczél, is determined to make this ambitious Chinese-Hungarian investment happen, a project that would make the entire town wealthy (and especially himself). However, to do so, he must first make peace with István, Pantallós' largest landowner. But István hates Tihamér more than he loves money and declares that the factory will only be built on his ancestral land over his dead body.This deadlock is disrupted by the arrival of the Guba family, former wealthy bankers. After the collapse of their bank and the arrest of Antal Guba, the family is forced to return to this remote and dull village—Antal's birthplace—where their crumbling house barely stands and where the once-influential Antal Guba is known simply as \"Tóni\" by the locals.The intertwined stories of Pantallós' three families explore themes of personal ambition, money, power, and pride. Only by setting aside their differences, settling their debts, overcoming past heartbreaks, and uniting can these characters attain what they truly need: family and love. Because, as the saying goes: \"Money fades, but family endures!\"",
