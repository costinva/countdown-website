  "overview": "Having had her state benefits cut to shreds after being made redundant, a young woman with very little left to lose begins to build an illegal drugs empire. But Emily isn't your average street-dealing dope peddler – she's sharp, funny, biting, highly educated – and on top of all that, she has cerebral palsy.People have underestimated Emily her entire life. If they're not patronising her for completing the most menial of tasks, they're pretending she's not there. What better disguise could there be for criminal activity than to be entirely written off by the same broken system which exists to protect the law? ",
