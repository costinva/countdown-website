  "overview": "Molly Pargeter has found the perfect Tuscan villa for her family's summer holiday. Molly had hoped to soak up the local colour and revel in the artistic masterpieces that surround her, instead she ends up exploring the mystery of the missing landlord. Meanwhile, her outrageously extroverted and libidinous father, Haverford Downs, has his sights set on a rich widow.",
