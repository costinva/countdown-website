  "overview": "The rise and rise of Ireland West Airport Knock will be explored in a new six-part UTV Ireland documentary series. Nestled just inland off the Wild Atlantic Way, and with the shadow of Croagh Patrick looming in the background, the legacy of Monsignor James Horan is celebrating 30 years in business this year. For the first time, we see inside the unlikely success story of an airport which was initially a strip of tarmacadam atop a peaty mountain.With exclusive access to every part of the airport itself, The Airport Up in Knock is a unique documentary following the daily lives of the customers and staff of Knock Airport, and demonstrates how tightly woven the airport is into the modern DNA of Mayo and the West of Ireland. From customer services to airport operations, right up to the kitchen where the infamous â€˜Knock Special' is prepared, you will meet the passengers, staff and community of this vital lifeline for the west.",
