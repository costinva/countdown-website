  "overview": "Australian stand up comedian Hannah Gadsby is a closet art scholar. Armed with a rapier wit and desire to pick beneath the paint, she travels across the continent in search of Australia ºs national identity. From first settlement to Federation to multiculturalism, Hannah will forge an irreverent new image of who we think we are by examining our identity through the history of our art.",
