  "overview": "Join celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito for a taste of his exclusive New York City parties on Rocco's Dinner Party. This self-contained competition series gives three highly skilled chefs a shot at crafting the perfect evening for DiSpirito and his handpicked celebrity guests including Liza Minnelli, Padma Lakshmi, Raven Symone, Sandra Bernhard, and Bryan Batt, to name a few. Each week, three new chefs have one shot at impressing DiSpirito by cooking their signature dish. The two strongest will advance to the next round, where they are challenged to develop a full menu in competing dinner parties. Yet food is only half the battle. Allowed one consultation with Jes Gordan, celebrity event producer, the chef's must also design a unique party concept, as d'cor and ambiance will be judged alongside their food. Each episode will have a theme for which the chef's must base their meal and dining experience around. Which party will be a scrumptious soiree and which a flavorless fiasco? DiSpirito will decide.",
