  "overview": "The program consists of the confinement of a variable number of participants in a graphic house, being watched by cameras 24 hours a day, with no connection to the outside world. Participants cannot communicate with their relatives and friends, read newspapers or other means to obtain external information. These participants are chosen by the production of the program, but they can create whether or not they want to enter the house and have the right to withdraw in the middle of the program.",
