  "overview": "By day, Shio manages an aromatherapy salon. But by night, she is the owner of \"Striped Sheep\", a business that dispatches men to the homes of women who suffer from insomnia to lie next to them. These \"Striped Sheep\" in fact represent a brand new profession of so-called \"co-sleepers,\" whose sole mission is to provide a night of relaxation to restless women. Shio's four \"sheep\" consist of Gai, her ex-husband's brother, Ran, a man with a cool, soothing gaze, the glib Linda and a taciturn book worm named Matthew. As sleep-sharers, these four men find out a lot about what drives or plagues their women clients, and help them gradually discover themselves and the right life pathways. \"There are nights when a woman just needs a man at her side.",
