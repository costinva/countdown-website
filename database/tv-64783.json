  "overview": "The zombie epidemic, which all of us are so scared on TV, yet occurred. Gradually people did not become. Zombies have gone to live in a dungeon, where there is no sunlight - there they are better. Over time, they remembered that they were once human beings. They built schools and began to develop. Zombiwill is an ordinary town, like many in a dungeon. There lives a lot of kids who do not sit still. Their favorite occupation is to play things that once belonged to people.",
