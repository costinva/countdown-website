  "overview": "The quarantine has passed and what everyone has been waiting for for so long has happened — planes have started flying again! People who were tired of self-isolation rushed to rest. And Dmitry Nagiyev was no exception. He received a great offer to combine business with pleasure: to work and relax in the emirates at the same time. It is very difficult to refuse — the amount is good, the weather is beautiful, and all you need to do is hold the sheikh's wedding. But it was not there! The trip turns into a test that Dmitry will have to pass in order to return home a completely different Nagiyev.",
