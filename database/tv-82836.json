  "overview": "This series explores the intersection of extreme wealth and violent crime, investigating how the pursuit of money, power, and status can lead to murder. Each episode focuses on a high-profile case, where either the victim or the perpetrator had considerable wealth, examining the motivations behind the crimes and the investigations that followed. With expert commentary and archive footage, the series delves into the often-complex factors that contribute to such crimes. Cases featured include the murder of William Saunderson-Smith, who lived â€˜under the radar', using different identities to conceal a sprawling property empire in London and the killing of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury.",
