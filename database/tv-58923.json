  "overview": "Filthy Garden SOS meets desperate owners whose out of control gardens are more dumpsite or jungle than sanctuary. For those willing to work hard to fix their problem, help is at hand.Â Award-winning garden designer Diarmuid Gavin, fellow designer and community garden champion Danny Clarke and Penny Lamb, who has the power tools to transform any landscape, have just days to teach the owners how to create a gorgeous garden that's easy to look after. After doing their share of clearing waste, building and planting, it's time for the owners to reveal to their families their new garden.",
