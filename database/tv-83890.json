  "overview": "At a one-of-a-kind clinic in the heart of the Yorkshire countryside, activist Jono Lancaster and a team of world-class surgeons and doctors come together to help provide cutting-edge care, free of charge, to people who society treats differently because of the way they look. In each episode, three people with visible facial differences have the opportunity to explore and, if they choose to, receive transformative treatments from some of the UK's most sought-after experts. Whether they decide to have treatment or not, they're also given mental health advice and support from Jono, who works with them on responding to other people's perceptions and behaviour. In this unique, uplifting and life-changing series, people with visible facial differences are given choices and the support to make the decisions they feel will shape happy, confident and fulfilling lives.Â ",
