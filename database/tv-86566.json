  "overview": "Grace and Leo Harte, both in their 40s run a crumbling hotel on the West Coast of Ireland. Grace feels she is stranded in a passionless marriage. She feels that by upgrading the hotel they might inject new life into their relationship. The hotel, Ostan Harte, has been a fixture on the landscape for many years. Leo sees no need to upgrade the hotel and seems consigned to the state they are in. Where Grace sees stasis, Leo sees stability. At the beginning of the series we see Grace, Leo, and Leo's elderly mother shutting down the hotel for the season as Winter approaches. It's a ritual that appears will go on forever. But we soon learn this is the last year they will ever do this as a series of catastrophic events are set in motion. The catalyst for these events is Danny, a young surfer, who sets up a surfing school on the beach adjacent to the hotel.",
