  "overview": "Welcome to Cypress Bay High School -- home of the award-winning newspaper The Circuit. Its fiercely competitive student staff exhibits the aptitude, pride and ambition of future leaders, and they want the world to know it. Between struggling to keep the peace with each other, maintaining good grades and managing extracurricular activities, these students have their hands full. But they still put their hearts and souls into writing memorable stories and making the best paper they possibly can. Every day, the paper's dynamic personalities battle it out to see who has what it takes to produce news that's fit to print. Journalism is taken very seriously at The Circuit, and its staff is a truly ambitious bunch. For many soon-to-be seniors, it's time to battle it out for the position of editor-in-chief. But only one will score the top slot.\t",
