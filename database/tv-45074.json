  "overview": "They say most homicide victims know their killer. But on the open road, your killer might just be someone you've yet to meet. America's highways are its arteries all 160,000 miles of them. But take a look around. How well do you really know the person next to you? How about that truck out front? And is the driver of that car behind just hunting for his next victim? In this series, we explore the deadliest tales of homicide on America's highways - where innocent journeys become deadly trips. Not everyone reaches their destination on the Highway to Hell.",
