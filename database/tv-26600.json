  "overview": "Five years after the public became aware of the existence of evolved humans - or \"EVOs.\" Said public is not entirely supportive of these EVOs. In fact, few people fall into the middle ground. Online, a community forms around the rallying cry of the anonymous Hero_Truther, who seeks to humanize EVOs in the wake of lies, slander and fear mongering. Among those posting their personal stories is Phoebe Frady, who is encouraged to document her origin story by her brother, Quentin. But as Phoebe struggles to control her power, she attracts unwanted attention from a mysterious new company.",
