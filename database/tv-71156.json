  "overview": "This drama is adapted from a novel by Jiulu Feixiang. In ancient times, many gods died but only one last deity Xing Zhi survived. Emperor Xing Zhi, without any emotion or desire, had been living beyond the sky for tens of thousands of years. In a war between the gods and the demons, he saved the situation by himself alone. But after that, he refused to see anyone and was nowhere to be found. Several hundred years later, a female demon lord Shen Li was born with a pearl in her mouth. On her thousandth birthday, she was arranged a marriage for political alliance. On her way of escaping this marriage, Shen Li got attacked and transformed back to her phoenix shape. She fell to the human world in a coma with serious wounds. A vendor took her as a fat chicken, plucked all her feathers and put her on sale in a cage. Shen Li woke up to find herself in this situation and got so pissed that she collapsed on her back. As she felt depressed and desperate, a delicate man in black and white stopped and stared at her in deep thought, \"I want this chicken.\" Just like that, the fates of the two people got intertwined closely because of this seemingly inadvertent trade.",
