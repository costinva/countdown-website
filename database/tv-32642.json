  "overview": "It's time, once again, to answer life's most savory question: whose cuisine reigns supreme? Iron Chef Showdown begins by pitting two of the most formidable chefs in the country against each other in The Chairman's Challenge, where they must create their best dish based upon a secret ingredient. Host Alton Brown serves as the sole judge to determine which chef will earn the right to face a legendary Iron Chef in the Secret Ingredient Showdown. Then, it's \"Allez Cuisine!\" as Japanese tradition comes back to life in Kitchen Stadium with Alton, The Chairman Mark Dacascos, floor reporter Jaymee Sire and a notable pantheon of culinary experts who sit in judgment over the epic battles.",
