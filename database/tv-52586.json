  "overview": "Were Norsemen the first Europeans to explore the Minnesota-Great Lakes and surrounding area more than a century before Christopher Columbus?

In Secrets of the Viking Stone, actor Peter Stormare and history enthusiast Elroy Balgaard set out to solve the mystery of the famed Kensington Runestone - an artifact that, if proven authentic, could rewrite the history of North America.",
