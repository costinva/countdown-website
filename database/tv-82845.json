  "overview": "Searching for Spain invites viewers to journey with Longoria across Spain's sun-drenched plains, rugged mountains and dramatic seascapes exploring its incredible wealth of cultures, climates and cuisines. This season, Longoria tastes her way through a bar crawl of pintxos in San Sebastián, Catalan prawns in Barcelona, and the iconic Spanish tortilla in Madrid. She ventures to the birthplace of tapas and samples some of the most expensive jamon in the world in Andalusia. In Galicia, she savors a bounty of fresh seafood and world class Galician blonde beef. Among the cider mills of Asturias, she explores the land of her ancestors and visits with family who still live in the town of Longoria to this day. Finally, audiences get a special peek into her new Spanish home in Marbella as she hosts a feast of local delicacies for her closest friends.",
