  "overview": "Incredible advances in medical science's ability to prolong life have huge cost implications for a financially strained NHS but prompt complex questions relating to quality of life. This powerful two-part observational documentary series provides an intimate, sensitive and heart-breaking account of the lives of children who can be kept alive but probably never cured. Filmed over the year when the Charlie Gard case gripped the nation, the programme delves deep into both sides of this emotive debate, asking if it's ever right to let a baby die. Based at Southampton Children's Hospital's Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, it features the parents of children and the doctors who care for them.",
