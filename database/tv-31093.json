  "overview": "On Louisiana River Builds, builder, craftsman and filmmaker Hampton Rutland and his team of expert contractors renovate cabins and family cottages along the rivers of Louisiana. Hampton and the crew bring a unique design to each of their projects by repurposing old materials and drawing on inspiration from Louisiana's abundant natural resources. As the visionary, Hampton creates stop-motion-animation films as a way to design, execute and document each build. The cabins and cottages that they renovate are usually family-owned, passed down from generation to generation and Hampton and the team are passionate about giving them new life so that they can be enjoyed by those families for years to come.",
