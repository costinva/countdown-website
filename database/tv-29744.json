  "overview": "Actor and comedian Alan Davies grew up in the 1980s, an era when it seemed everything from race relations to sexual politics, jobs and the economy - was going through a revolution. And it was the conflicts of that decade that helped shape Alan - and shaped the Britain we live in today. Packed with archive footage and home videos, this three-part series offers Alan's very personal history of the 1980s. Starting as a rebellious teenager in suburban Essex, it tells the story of coming of age in Thatcher's Britain.",
