  "overview": "A new all-female sketch series featuring the writing and performing talents of four hotly tipped new comics - Alice Lowe, Sarah Kendall, Barunka O'Shaughnessy and Clare Thomson. The four comedy actresses write and perform all the material, introducing audiences to a broad range of characters and the peculiarities of their own imaginary world, like being robots, owning a magic bin and dating a duck. Recurring characters include rude South African airline hostesses Jadine and Marla; and the Sex in the City girls, who annoy everyone by misbehaving and acting childishly in a highstreet bar.",
