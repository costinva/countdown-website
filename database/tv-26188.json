  "overview": "When everything you believed in for your entire life turns out to be a devastating lie, then will you direct your anger at the person who caused it all or forgive that person? This drama tells a story about people who are hell-bent on recovering what they think is rightfully theirs while on the opposite side, there are people who will fight to protect what belongs to them. In the beginning, the two sides hate each other's guts. They do despicable things that will make it impossible to ever make things right again. But there is still a sliver of hope. The pent-up anger within themselves softens and they begin a path of rehabilitation and redemption that will allow them to forgive their enemies and bury the hatchet. This drama is not a story about revenge and aguish but a story of rehabilitation and harmony. Viewers will empathize with their agony and pain while also rejoicing at their happiness. The takeaway from it all is that love is a powerful force that can conquer all.",
