  "overview": "LBJ: Triumph and Tragedy is a four-part CNN Original Series that offers a captivating look at one of the most consequential and enigmatic presidents in American history: Lyndon Baines Johnson. Thrust into the presidency under tragic circumstances, LBJ used the office and political mastery to pass the most significant civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. But while he was reshaping the social fabric of America, he was simultaneously escalating a war that would rip the country apart at the seams, subsequently overshadowing his domestic accomplishments. Weaving together dramatic first-hand accounts from the last surviving members of LBJ's inner circle, never-before-broadcast archival material, and LBJ's own voice from secretly recorded audiotapes, Emmy Award-winning director Pat Kondelis crafts an intimate portrait of a larger-than-life figure full of fascinating contradictions, who left behind a complicated and polarizing legacy. ",
