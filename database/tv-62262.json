  "overview": "Zeynep is a beautiful little girl with a dangerous heart defect, so when her mother Cemre dies in a car crash, no one tells her. Instead, her father Murat hires a lookalike to pretend to be Cemre until Zeynep is old enough for heart surgery. But who is this lookalike, and how does she come to resemble Cemre so closely? And why does Murat hate his dead wife so much? Who is pulling the strings from behind the scenes?",
