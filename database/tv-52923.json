  "overview": "Fadil Opančić is a simple peasant and president of a cooperative in the village of Donje Brabonjište. Due to the embezzlement he committed in favor of his cousin Uzeir, a minister in the Government, he was forced to flee the village. Together with his wife Bahra and son Pipun, Fadil moved to Sarajevo. Uzeir uses his position to provide his cousin Fadil with a spacious apartment in the center of Sarajevo and the position of manager of the City Theater. The Opančić family thus moved into an apartment just above the apartment where the Gospodnetićs live. Josip and Ana Gospodnetić are urban people with contemporary views on life and thoughts.",
