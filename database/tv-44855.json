  "overview": "The vast Appalachia region stretches across 13 states and is home to more than 23 million people, yet it may be the least understood culture in America. Appalachia has existed for generations as a region apart, isolated physically and culturally by its rugged mountains. The ethnically diverse Appalachian people - including many of the country's first immigrants - played a profound, and often overlooked, part in the nation's history and cultural and economic development. The Appalachians is a comprehensive historical and cultural overview of this distinctive region. This three-part series documents the unique legacy, courage, character, arts, and culture of the central and southern Appalachian people. The film includes the work of outstanding Appalachian historians and scholars, writers, and musicians, including Ricky Skaggs, Loretta Lynn, and traditional folk artists from the region.",
