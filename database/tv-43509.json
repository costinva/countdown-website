  "overview": "The Muppets are about to upload their brand-new streaming series. Miss Piggy becomes a lifestyle guru with her new blog, Lifestyle with Miss Piggy. Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant, Beaker, take science to the streets in Muppet Labs Field Test. The Swedish Chef does culinary combat with challengers in Økėÿ Døkęÿ Køøkīñ. Muppet interviewers sit down with celebrity icons in the same fields to talk shop in Mup Close &amp; Personal. Pepe The King Prawn is the ringleader of a wildly unpredictable (and made-up-on-the-spot) game show in Pepe's ¡Unbelievable! Game Show. Muppet fanboy Walter gets an education in an obscure hobby in Muppet Masters. Now, it's all up to Scooter to finish everything and get it uploaded before deadline - navigating whatever obstacles, distractions, and complications the rest of the Muppet gang throw at him.",
