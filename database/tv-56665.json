  "overview": "The report is about the Penny Market on St. Pauli, which was then open daily until 11 p.m. and is located in the building of the former Allotria variety theater. In addition to around 5,000 rolls, fresh fruit and vegetables from the Hamburg wholesale market, mostly alcohol is sold there. On six weekends, the Spiegel TV author Markus Gr√ºn documented the daily routine there. He met dock workers from the jetties, former neighborhood thugs, survivors and bargain hunters.",
