  "overview": "The Outlaws follows seven strangers from different walks of life forced together to complete a Community Payback sentence in Bristol.At first, they seem like archetypes we can easily pigeonhole, but gradually we see behind their fa√ßades, understand their hidden depths, and what made them the people they are today. We are reminded that no one is all good or all bad. Everyone has a story.As their unlikely new friendships intersect with their complicated private lives, The Outlaws must unite to protect one of their own from Bristol's most dangerous criminal gang.",
