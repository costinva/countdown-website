  "overview": "There are those who start war, and those who have war thrust upon them. The outcome of war is well-documented, but the nuanced beginnings are often forgotten. The stage is set for dramatic new history, set immediately before the first strike. Edge of War is a documentary series that explores the personalities, words and actions of those that take their countries to battle. These stories of larger-than-life individuals are based on historic accounts and newly uncovered information. Academics, historians and those caught in battle testify to the complex political, military and personal reasons for the deadliest action.",
