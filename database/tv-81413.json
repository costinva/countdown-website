  "overview": "The series takes place after 2014 in a de-occupied mining town that is gradually returning to peaceful life. The main characters are two families that have long been separated by quarrels and endless arguments. The misunderstanding between them does not subside even after the news of their children's engagement. To make matters worse, former friends and now sworn enemies Pavel Dotsenko and Grisha Kulikov become the main contenders for the mayor's office. The competition for the favor of the townspeople constantly leads to complicated, confusing, and sometimes funny situations. Will the enemies be able to unite on the verge of a full-scale invasion by Russia, and will they be able to become one family for the sake of the future?",
