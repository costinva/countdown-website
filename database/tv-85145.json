  "overview": "Born into abject poverty, Chen Pan'er is coerced into a brothel by the local magistrate under the pretense of a river god ritual. She makes a daring escape, changes her name to Bao Yin, and sells herself into service to escape her fate. She later crosses paths with Wen Su, the eldest son of the Wen family, who once rescued her, only to discover that he has become the consort of the Princess Royal. Faced with adversity, Bao Yin and Wen Su join forces, carefully navigating the dangers, clearing their names, and ultimately achieving success at the highest level.",
