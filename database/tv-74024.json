  "overview": "Yug Kipen is a reserved, modest boy raised by his grandmother. Yug's mother died when he was three years old, and he never saw his father. Everything changes when, on his 14th birthday, Yug discovers money from his father in his grandmother's closet. From this moment begins the story of the South's great journey in search of his father. Potential fathers are scattered throughout Russia. The South will have to cross the entire country to meet everyone. He will visit the most beautiful corners of our country, and of course, he will see the main attraction of Russia - the people! To make such a journey for a 14-year-old teenager, in principle, is not easy, and for the South it is even more difficult, because he has a bunch of phobias that he will have to overcome every time.",
