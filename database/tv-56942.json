  "overview": "In Hellbound, supernatural beings appear out of nowhere to condemn people to hell. It doesn't matter whether these events are a blessing or a curse: a new religious group is interpreting them all as the will of the divine. What unfolds through this predicament is an intense and highly-charged story about people who must survive under conditions of utter social chaos.",
