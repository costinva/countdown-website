  "overview": "Celebrity Poker Showdown was filmed before a live audience at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Each episode of Celebrity Poker Showdown will feature five celebrities competing against each other for a piece of the $250,000 prize pool in a game of No Limit Texas Hold'em poker for the charity of their choice. Each week a new crop of stars will take to the table to challenge their peers. The winner from each week's game will go on to compete in the championship final sixth episode. Viewers will have the inside track on the hands the different players are holding via hidden cameras. They will also be able to hear from the eliminated players, who will watch the remainder of their respective matches from the \"Loser's Lounge\", via closed circuit television.",
