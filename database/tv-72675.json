  "overview": "The protagonist of the series decides to make some extra money and sets up a profitable, but not entirely legal business. The guy pretends to be a medium and promises people to solve all their problems: to find a missing person, to catch an unfaithful spouse cheating, and even to \"bring back luck\" to some clients. The business is in great demand, but everything can be ruined when the protagonist's success is noticed by journalist Elia, who specializes in exposing pseudo-magicians. To divert the girl's attention, he will have to develop a rather unusual plan.",
