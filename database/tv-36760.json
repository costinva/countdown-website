  "overview": "This documentary series about The New York Times in the Trump era illuminates critical issues facing journalism today. A chief task for the Times, long considered the \"newspaper of record,\" is to find the best way to accurately and honestly cover this unconventional president, even as he tries to undermine them. Through extraordinary access and exclusive interviews, OscarÂ® nominated filmmaker Liz Garbus chronicles the tenacious men and women in the trenches who are fighting for the freedom of the press and America's right to know.",
