  "overview": "Blackboard Wars centers on a high school tarnished by failing academic performance and stigmatized by a culture of violence. Granted unprecedented access, cameras go behind the scenes to follow no-nonsense principal Dr. Marvin Thompson and education maverick Steve Barr as they embark together on an unpredictable mission to reinvent and revive the struggling school. Throughout the series, viewers will witness the daily challenges the staff face as their students struggle with a range of emotionally demanding obstacles including homelessness, violence, drug use and teenage pregnancy. Tensions mount as teachers work to earn the trust of the students amidst intense scrutiny from the community.",
