  "overview": "Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter delves into the lives of Nick and Aaron Carter. From their outsized fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s to their headline-making struggles in recent years, the docuseries pulls back the curtain on the fraught dynamic of the Carter family and the dark side of such an abrupt rise to fame. At its core, Fallen Idols explores the accusations of sexual assault against Nick Carter by three women, while also diving into his brother, Aaron Carter's, struggles with mental health and substance abuse - and the rift that occurred after Aaron decided to support his brother's accusers.",
