  "overview": "Bigheads, hosted by Jason Manford, is an ITV physical game show. Each week, 12 ordinary members of the public are transformed into famous people by donning big unwieldy, rubber celebrity heads. Once transformed these Bigheads face one another in a series of massive physical cartoonish games, all in front of a live arena audience.",
