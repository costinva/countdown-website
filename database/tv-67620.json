  "overview": "In Hey Yahoo! two teams of three players each compete to guess what millions of people are searching for on Yahoo Search. Contestants are given the first half of a search, and then have to fill-in-the-blank based on what they think America is searching for. At the end of three rounds, the team with the most money wins and will go on to the bonus round for a chance to win $10,000.",
