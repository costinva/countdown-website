  "overview": "Sunny and Vince welcome two teams of talented tailgating duos outside the stadium on game day - one representing their home turf and the other fans of the visiting team. In the first round - known as \"The First Down\" - each team must create a platter of their best bite-sized snacks with a dip that represents their city's flavors. The winner of round one, as determined by a rotating panel of judges, gets an advantage and selects an ingredient significant to their hometown that both teams must use in round two. In round two's \"Between the Uprights\" battle, the duos must make their best handheld tailgate treat between the buns and the losing team is penalized as one player must complete a tailgate game before entering the final round. In the \"Hail Mary\" third round, each team must create a tailgate platter of a meat and two sides that would make their hometown proud. Finally, the grand-prize winner is named and presented a \"Yum-bardi Trophy\" by a guest NFL legend and then, in a once-in-a-lifetime moment, the winning duo is ushered right into the stadium to their VIP seats on the 50-yard line.",
