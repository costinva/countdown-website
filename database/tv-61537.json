Victims who were killed by someone went to her and told her that they still have their thoughts left in the world and want to come back to life. Sara told the deads that they need to find out the truth of their deaths in order to revive. However, not only did they learn about the truths of their incidents, they also find out that they did not live hard when they were alive. The best time to change your life is when you find the readiness to live!",
