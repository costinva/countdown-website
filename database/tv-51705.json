  "overview": "Unlucky at cards - and then also unlucky in love. For Basti things get really tough in the festive season: his career as a musician is not crowned with success and the prospect of having to celebrate a rather depressing Christmas after separating from his girlfriend Fine pulls the general mood down even more. A visit over the holidays to meet his family promises a welcome distraction - but when his brother Niklas suddenly appears with ex Fine at his side, Basti even loses the last bit of hope for a happy future.",
