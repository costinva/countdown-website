From the jungles of Brazil, to the prairies of North America and deserts of Africa, he meets the most dangerous and charismatic wild dogs in the natural world. And ultimately he reveals how one of our most feared predators went on to become man's best friend.Patrick reveals amazing stories behind the oldest living carnivores on the planet. It's an epic story that began thirty four million years ago. Through nail-bitingly close encounters, sumptuous wildlife photography, field demos and a CGI family tree - he shows how different members of this family evolved bizarre bodies, intelligent behaviours and tight-knit social groups to thrive in some of the planet's wildest landscapes.",
