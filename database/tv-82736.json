  "overview": "Peek inside the lives of penguins, giraffes, chimps, and other animals that behave a whole lot like humans. Touch down on all seven continents around the world to see why these wild creatures compete, cooperate, love and grieve just like we do. From dolphins creating names to flamingos wearing makeup and monkeys that floss to sharks that visit the dentist, the animal kingdom is surprisingly similar to our own!",
