  "overview": "Fanny, 16, is a teenager like any other. She dreams of adventure and emancipation, she loves dancing and lives a first love story. One day, she meets Natasha, who introduces her to Damien. Older than Fanny, Damien is a singer who seems to make a good living; money is never a problem for him and he spoils Fanny. She does not take long to fall in love with him and is introduced to a world that was previously unknown to her: that of dancing bars and prostitution. Manipulated and trapped, Fanny sinks and runs away repeatedly. Her parents, Myl√®ne and Laurent, her brother Mathias, her sister Anabel and her grandmother Manon will all be caught up in the whirlwind of anxiety and worry caused by her fall.",
