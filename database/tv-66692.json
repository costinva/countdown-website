  "overview": "Totally Weird and Funny brings the strangest, craziest and most hilarious videos from online and beyond right to the stage in front of a live studio audience. Every episode features the panel of hosts – comedian Mikalah Gordon, standup comedian Brian Cooper and actor Noah Matthews – vying to submit the funniest or weirdest clip of the week. Viewers at home can also play along with the studio audience in games such as \"Real or Fake\" where the hosts present three products, one real and two fake, and it is up to the audience to find the real product. ",
