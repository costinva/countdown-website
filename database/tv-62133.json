  "overview": "Set in 1850s Australia, The Artful Dodger explores the adult double life of Charles Dickens' famous prince of thieves, Jack Dawkins aka The Artful Dodger, whose fast pickpocketing fingers have turned into the skilled hands of a surgeon. In the lively colony of Port Victory, Dodger's past returns to haunt him with the arrival of Fagin, luring him back into a world of crime. A greater threat - to Dodger's heart - is Lady Belle, the Governor's daughter, determined to become the colony's first female surgeon.",
