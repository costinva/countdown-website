  "overview": "Lovable moron, Chris, is a well-meaning duck who just wants to make friends and bring joy to his seedy run-down London park. Unfortunately, although he has the best intentions, his cluelessness and desperation to please are frequently exploited by his self-serving friends -- paranoid squirrel, Tracey and scumbag mallard, Roger -- inevitably leading to chaos, destruction and random acts of arson.",
