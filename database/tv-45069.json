  "overview": "This three-part series is an epic journey of discovery of the natural world along the Amur and its tributaries and of the rich wildlife and the native people inhabiting the Earth's greatest remaining wilderness area--a surprising and exotic world shaped and perpetually reshaped by extreme forces of the atmosphere and one of the Earth's most active tectonic zones. The three episodes portray the unique characters of the Amur's lower, middle and upper reaches--separate worlds that could not be more different and diverse.",
