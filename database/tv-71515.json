  "overview": "This is the gripping story of maverick tabloid reporter, Mazher Mahmood â€“ the king of the sting. Playing the role of a wealthy Arab sheikh, he dupes models, royals, and A-list stars with elaborate undercover operations. He was at the top of British journalism for almost three decades. But then comes an extraordinary downfall. Mahmood becomes the front-page story himself and the tables are turned.",
