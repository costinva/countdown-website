  "overview": "The Witching Season is a Halloween horror anthology series composed of short horror films that are presented on YouTube as a free web series. Inspired by classic anthology shows such as \"Tales From The Crypt\", \"The Twilight Zone\", and \"Are You Afraid Of The Dark?\", The Witching Season delivers originally produced tales of terror, all set during the Halloween season. Fueled nostalgia, the series pays special attention to the spirit of Halloween and reminds us of the magic that exists during that special time of year.",
