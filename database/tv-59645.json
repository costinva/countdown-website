  "overview": "Detective by chance, out of anger and human curiosity, always poised between ironic indolence and blues yearning, in his search for the truth Carlo Monterossi will have to confront a couple of cultured and professional killers, two gypsies looking for revenge, collectors and smugglers of Nazi-fascist souvenirs, incredible personal exchanges, a woman who seems to have lived several times and a cruel past that returns and leaves indecipherable clues behind. A comedic twist based on Alessandro Robecchi's successful crime novels.",
