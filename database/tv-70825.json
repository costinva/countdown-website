  "overview": "Wild Tanzania features the greatest aspects of Tanzanian wildlife in locations spread across the wide and diverse landscape of this enthralling African country. From Tanzania's oldest and most popular park, the Serengeti, famed for its annual migration, where predator versus prey dominates; to the islands of Maziwe, Fanjove and Chumbe, where marine conservationists work hard to preserve its fragile ecosystem, the series captures the pressure of the natural and human threats on the Tanzanian flora and fauna.",
