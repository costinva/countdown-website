  "overview": "Kathi is starting a new chapter in life.Her daughter Lilly is almost grown, and her husband has left. As a pedicurist in a small salon, she meets the people of Marzahn—many of whom go days without real conversation and pour out their hearts the moment they step inside.They cherish every touch, grateful for a place where they feel seen and respected.With each encounter, Kathi rediscovers herself, realizing that happiness is a choice. More and more, she understands that this salon has saved her.Starring Jördis Triebel, Yvonne Yung Hee Bormann, and Deborah Kaufmann, this six-part miniseries is directed by rising star Clara Zoë My-Linh von Arnim (\"Die Zweiflers\") and based on the autofictional bestseller by Katja Oskamp.",
