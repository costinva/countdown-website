  "overview": "Join host Shane Jacobson along with Sam Pang, Merrick Watts, Joel Creasey, Georgie Parker, Fiona O'Loughlin, Matt Preston, Brendan Jones and Chrissie Swan as they take off the gloves and duke it out over which generation is the hottest, the toughest and, ultimately, the best of them all. When was the best time to be an Aussie? Boomers claim the 60s and 70s; for Gen X, the hey-days were the 80s and 90s; Gen Y are sure the Noughties and 2010s rule; but for Gen Z it's right now. Which generation will reign supreme?",
