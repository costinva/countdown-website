  "overview": "Supernatural entities feed off of fear, and the greater the fear the more dangerous spirits become. In this special four-part miniseries, Zak Bagans, Aaron Goodwin, Jay Wasley and Billy Tolley quarantine themselves inside Zak Bagans' Haunted Museum, which has been shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. They will each confront the frightening energy surrounding the museum's most haunted artifacts, to find out just how powerful and dangerous these entities can become during an unprecedented time. Each episode features a different area of the museum, alongside Skype interviews with museum tour guides and museum guests who have been attacked, among others.Â ",
