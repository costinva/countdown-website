  "overview": "For many small towns across America, a Friday night spent under the blinding lights of the local high school football stadium cheering the home team onto victory is the glue that holds a community together. But, what happens when the Friday night lights shut off and the town's beloved team finds themselves embroiled in the center of a tragic crime? How does a community so devoted to football reckon with the aftermath â€“ one that may force them to either cope with the devastating loss of one of their own or look at their treasured team and players differently? A new series from ID takes an unflinching look at the shocking and tragic cases of dangerous obsessions, brutal violence and even murder surrounding local high school football teams, tarnishing the sport these communities hold sacred.",
