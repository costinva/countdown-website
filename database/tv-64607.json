  "overview": "Ponet-sur-Mer is a quiet little fishing port on the island of Oleron where nothing much happens apart from the Oyster Festival. A way too quiet life for Ben and Florian, two young gamers, streamers, and hackers, who share their time between thankless jobs as cleaning agents at the local spa and a much more exciting double life on the web and Darknet.",
