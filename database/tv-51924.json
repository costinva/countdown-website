  "overview": "Yuriy Bragin returns to St. Petersburg after a long business trip, where he was part of an investigative team investigating another high-profile case. In his hometown, he learns that the current head of the Department, Vadim Maltsev, is retiring. With a high degree of probability, it is Bragin who will be offered his place. But Yuriy is not a careerist and the place of the boss is not for him. A talented investigator likes to do \"live work\" more. Soon, he is sent on a business trip again, this time to a small town in the Leningrad region, where two girls were killed within a week.",
