  "overview": "Super Intern is a new program that will select interns based only on a SWOT analysis (study looking at the company's strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats) without looking at the applicant's age, academic credentials, sex, and personal connections. After interning for six weeks, the finalists will become full-time JYP Entertainment employees.",
