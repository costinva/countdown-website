  "overview": "Every day, thousands of Danish motorists take completely insane and often fateful chances in traffic. This is a great danger to themselves and other road users. Many of these situations are taken up by the police, and in Kanal 5's new crime program Fanget på Politiets kamera, viewers get unique access to the most hair-raising, violent and surprising clips from police archives. We come very close to the life-threatening situations and join the front seat when the police set off on the most extreme mad drivers on the Danish roads.",
