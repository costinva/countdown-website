  "overview": "Abigail, an exceptionally beautiful schoolgirl, vents her mischievousness on her professors and nuns, causing continual distractions. Her conduct is a reflection of a discontented life. Her mother died when Abigail was very young. Her father, wealthy and flirtatious, has time only for business, women and none for Abigail. One of Abigail's desires is to capture the affections of her literature professor, Carlos Alfredo Ruiz, an intelligent young man, handsome and advanced in his studies, but beneath Abigail's social class. Abigail's rival for Carlos Alfredo's love is Maria Clara Martinez, who is a fine woman, more suitable for him. Carlos Alfredo holds onto this attachment to avoid being snared by Abigails amorous designs. This is the background for the tumultuous saga Abigail faces: tormented love, and unhappy marriage, insanity, her adored child, uncaring relatives, and most important of all - her untiring love for Carlos Alfredo.",
