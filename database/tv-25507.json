  "overview": "The story unfolds in 1946, the first year after World War 2. Crime and corruption were also rampant, and the country's law enforcement resources were stretched to the limits to protect state-owned and public property, including food crops. Severe punishments were introduced by the authorities, including prison sentences of up to ten years and even execution by firing squad.",
