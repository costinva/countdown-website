  "overview": "Petersburg, 1903.  A world of luxury and leisure for men, a world of fear and submission for women.  Ksenia and Stesha work in an underground brothel under the control of a pretty and ruthless lady.  Girls sell men their bodies, feelings, flirting and the illusion of love.  It seems they have nothing but beauty.  In fact, they have access to a secret power - purity of the soul and the desire for freedom.  And with this power they can change everything.",
