  "overview": "Over the course of history, skilled craftsmen helped shape the fate of mankind by constructing the most iconic weaponry known to man. Inspired by age-old traditions, Discovery Channel is gathering the best builders to battle it out in a head-to-head competition to re-create the armaments that have changed the course of history. The greatest empires leaned on the backs of weapon craftsmen to create the blades, bows and ballistics that would win wars and alter history forever. Now, modern weapons smiths will put their technical knowledge and ingenuity to the test giving insight into age-old building techniques - and the traditions, methods and craftsmanship that define them. Each episode, three builders will face-off in two historical challenges that call upon era-specific weaponry, from the firearms of the frontier to the blades of the Vikings. But these aren't just quickly fabricated weapons - each tool will be heavily researched and crafted pieces of art. In each episode, blade, ballistic and bow weapons will be rigorously tested as well as judged on their design, historical accuracy, and abilities. With an elimination after each challenge, only one smith will walk away with the grand prize of $10,000 and be crowned the Master of Arms.",
