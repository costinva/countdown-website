  "overview": "For the new boss Eva de Vries, the course is clear: only rigorous savings will be able to save the Hotel Mondial. De Vries is herself a deportee, her global hotel group has ordered her directly from the management board to the less than glamorous Schwerin. Eva now keeps everyone busy there, but she didn't reckon with the temperament of the food boss Uli and even less with the fact that she soon started to develop feelings for the woman. Uli leads a happy family life with the housekeeping boss Jeremy. A little later, Lara Hildebrandt shows up at the hotel with a very specific purpose: she wants to find out at all costs what happened to her mother on a dramatic night years ago. She then disappeared from the hotel without a trace. Actually, she plans to work as an assistant to the management, but Eva does not tolerate that.",
