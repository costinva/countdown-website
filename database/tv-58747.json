  "overview": "Takashi Tōno is a freshman student who is transferred from Tokyo to Morimori Academy, a private college prep boarding high school located deep in the mountains. Soon after arriving, he befriends Kyōsuke Yaguchi, who is a member of the soccer club and invites Tōno to join him in the club. Tōno's lack of interest in sports forces him to enter the quietest club of all: the photography club. However, the photography club is not what it seems, since the members' duties consist of having sex with other students of the school.",
