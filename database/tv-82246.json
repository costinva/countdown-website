  "overview": "What happens when six opinionated Brits with starkly opposed views on immigration confront the harsh realities of refugee life? Dave, a chef from Nottingham; Bushra, a small business owner from Surrey; Chloe, a GB News regular from Cornwall; Nathan, a haulage business owner from Barnsley; Mathilda, a podcaster from London; and Jess, a sports coach from Wales, put their outspoken views on immigration to the ultimate test on a life-changing journey. In Mogadishu in Somalia and Raqqa in Syria, two of the world's most dangerous cities, they're exposed to a life of missile strikes, overcrowded refugee camps, and the crippling poverty endured by millions. Often hiding behind humour, their deeply polarized views on immigration are pushed to breaking point, sparking intense conflicts and shocking revelations. Through Africa, the Middle East and Europe, heading back to the UK, they cross vast deserts, climb treacherous mountain borders, and endure some of the peril of small boat crossings as they uncover the raw truth of how refugees reach Britain, why they risk everything to get here, and what they leave behind. Will this eye-opening journey change their minds on immigration, or will it only strengthen their resolve?",
