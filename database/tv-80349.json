  "overview": "An explosive series offering unfiltered insights into America's most notorious killer, Charles Manson. Through 20 years' worth of never-before-aired conversations, those closest to the case have their views challenged as Manson talks openly about his part in the infamous crimes, as well as his upbringing, criminal youth and his true feelings about \"The Family.\" Manson reveals the cruelty he suffered in reform school and the childhood experiences that made him who he was. Former \"Family\" members listen to the exclusive conversations and are taken back to the time when they \"would do anything for Charlie.\" Manson recounts the early crimes that led to the murder spree in the summer of ‘69, laying out an explanation of loyalty and brotherhood that pushes against the accepted motive: his desire to incite Helter Skelter. In the final moments before his death, Manson reflects on his life in prison and shows rare tenderness for the man who spoke to him across the decades. ",
