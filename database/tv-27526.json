  "overview": "This two-part documentary for ITV closely follows the work of High Court enforcement officers as they try to reclaim debts from those who haven't paid up, and evict people who are illegally occupying properties.The Enforcers provides a vivid insight into the work of the men and women who are called in at the end of a legal battle as agents of the court to ensure a judge's order is met. It features scenes from the evictions of travellers and squatters from land and properties, the repossession of rental homes, the removal of cars and even a restaurant kitchen after debtors fail to pay what they owe.The programme also looks into the personal fallout of the recent financial crisis, as a City worker is evicted from his property after being made redundant.",
