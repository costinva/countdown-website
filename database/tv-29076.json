  "overview": "In Minnesota, just about everyone owns a cabin whether it's on the water or buried deep in the woods. And while some are worn down after years of neglect, others were just poorly built in the first place. With so many people in need of restoration work, it can be big business for builders with the skill and style. In Prior Lake, Minnesota, Chase and Brock Jurgensen are those builders. Chase heads up the projects and big brother Brock finds creative uses for reclaimed wood in each build. Together they are a dream team that can transform any old lodge into a new functional and beautiful home in the wild. The duo takes over DIY Network's Facebook page to introduce their new series, Rustic Renovation.",
