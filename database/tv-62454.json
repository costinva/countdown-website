  "overview": "In Victoria &amp; Albert: The Royal Wedding, Lucy Worsley restages their wedding. Each detail is brought back to life in a spectacular ceremony as Lucy reveals how this event saved the monarchy and invented modern marriage. Aided by a team of experts, Lucy recreates the most important elements of the ceremony and the celebrations, scouring history books, archives, newspapers, and Queen Victoria's diaries for the details. She reveals how every moment was brilliantly stage-managed for maximum effect. Like every good marriage celebration, the film is a heady mix of fine food, fabulous clothes, music, emotion, gossip, and intrigue. From the white dress to the massive tiered white cake, from the music sung by the choir to the moment rings were exchanged, each element has been carefully researched and remade for a grand staging of the big day itself. The experts include food historian Annie Gray, clothing expert Harriet Waterhouse, and military historian Jasdeep Singh. Woven into the recreation of the wedding day is the story of Victoria and Albert's courtship and engagement and its political importance. Lucy unpacks and explores the hidden iconography and symbolism of this hugely significant wedding, revealing new insights into Victoria and Albert's public and private relationship. The film sheds new light on the broader implications of the wedding and reveals how this one extraordinary event helped invent modern marriage.",
