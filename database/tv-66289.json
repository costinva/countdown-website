  "overview": "France 2 presents Les rencontres du Papotin. This new atypical interview magazine takes up the DNA of the newspaper Le Papotin, whose editorial staff (40 to 50 young people) is made up of journalists, non-professionals, with autism spectrum disorder. In each episode, a unique personality is interviewed without filter and without a star presenter. During this meeting, the rules of the game are simple: \"you can tell Papotin anything, but, above all, anything can happen!\"",
