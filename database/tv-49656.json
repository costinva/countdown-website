  "overview": "НАШІ БЕЗ РАШІ is an Internet sketch show that tells about the country that every Ukrainian would like to live in.In This country, OUR PEOPLE answer to the question \"How are you?\" with \"Great\", not the traditional \"as long as it's not worse\". In OUR cities, innovative \"start-ups\" are opening every day, not kiosks with cigarettes. OUR PEOPLE primarily look at what is happening at home, not at their neighbors.And most importantly - OUR PEOPLE are sure that everything will be fine for them, because OUR people are WITHOUT RUSSIA:)",
