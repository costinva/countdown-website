  "overview": "Siaja is a young Inuk mother who wants to build a new future for herself. After a spontaneous — and extremely public — exit from her marriage, Siaja has to find a job and a place for her and her young daughter to live, and fast. Her only option might be to go from one complicated living situation to another — where Siaja's dreams of a fresh start collide with some long-kept secrets. To top it all off, this is happening in a small Arctic town where everybody knows your business.",
