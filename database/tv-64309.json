  "overview": "In a present-day Spain, divided and on the brink of political chaos, inquisitive millennial investigative reporter Antonia stumbles on a decades-old conspiracy: the existence of a cryogenically frozen super-agent, García, created in a laboratory in the 1950s by General Franco's fascist secret services. After sixty years in deep sleep, this perfect soldier with incredible physical strength, programmed to obey orders without question, is woken by Antonia. García finds himself disoriented and confused in a Spain that has changed beyond recognition. The old-world collides with the new as García and Antonia must learn to work together as they are drawn deeper and deeper into a political conspiracy that threatens to overthrow democracy and plunge Spain back into brutal dictatorship. ",
