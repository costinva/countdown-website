Every episode, Iain roasts social clips, posts and trends, with three famous faces - comedians, online celebrities and TV personalities - joining him each week to tackle their own online bugbears. And alongside all the roasting, Iain and his guests also offer up some ingenious and hilarious solutions to the dumpster fire that is the online world.With outrageous clips, funny chat and top comedy performances, Iain and his guests take the internet down a peg or two, while all also secretly hoping their best bits will go viral.",
