  "overview": "Muzlamic is a sketch show exploring life from the perspective of two Muslim comedians, or rather, two comedians who happen to be Muslim. The duo's comic creations include Mabz, an enthusiastic barber from Bethnal Green, a pair of colleagues competing to be the whitest in their office, and a couple of Muslim holidaymakers who have worked out the most efficient way to get through airport security, and many more.",
