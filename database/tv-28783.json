  "overview": "There have been many moments on Liveline that have made the entire country immediately stop what they're doing and turn up the volume. In Call Back, Joe Duffy looks back at some of the standout stories on the nation's favourite radio talk show and follows up on the most memorable for a TV audience. Each programme in this six-part series episode asks what happened after these stories featured on Liveline - and follows up on the sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes heart-warming outcomes.",
