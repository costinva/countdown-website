  "overview": "Retired investigator Vera uses cards to contact her deceased mother, who helps her find clues in the most complicated and high-profile cases. The death of a loved one and the loss of a child have completely thrown Vera off track, so her husband, also an investigator, is categorically against her returning to the stressful work of the police, and he is skeptical about fortune telling. This causes conflicts in the family, because Vera longs to be useful and do what she loves, and the cards always suggest the right decisions.",
