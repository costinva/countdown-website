  "overview": "This new series follows six couples as they strive to create bold and beautiful gardens with the help of expert landscape gardener Matthew Wilson. But this is no ordinary gardening programme, all six projects are more ambitious and dramatic than anything seen on television before. Each episode follows a different project: in Devon, Hedingham, Suffolk, Guernsey, Sussex and Wales.",
