  "overview": "One year after the violent eruption of the subglacial volcano Katla, the peace and tranquility in the small town of Vik is dramatically disturbed. As people evacuate the area, the ice near the volcano starts to melt. The few remaining people manage to provide necessary community service. But despite its grand location, the area turns out to be somewhat apocalyptic â€” mysterious elements that have been deeply frozen into the glacier from prehistoric times start to emerge from the melting ice and cause consequences no one could have ever foreseen.",
