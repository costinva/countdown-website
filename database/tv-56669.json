  "overview": "Nicolas Valeyre is a UFO. An original and uncompromising French teacher, his whimsical methods, his misanthropy and his rough-and-tumble style disturb his superiors as much as he inspires confidence in his students... Underneath his bear-like exterior, Nicolas Valeyre is a passionate hypersensitive, ready to do anything to help his students find their way.",
