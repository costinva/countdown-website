  "overview": "In My First Home, watch as realtors guide first time home buyers through the process of balancing their dream home wish list with their budget. A great neighborhood, pool and several bedrooms are often on a first time home buyer's wish list, but more often than not - that list doesn't align with the budget. Realtors must educate these hunters to help them zero in on what's most important and what they can afford. In the end, many purchasers are able to see past unflattering paint and old fixtures in order to visualize the potential for a home in a new space.",
