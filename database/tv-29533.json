  "overview": "Frank Buck was a legendary guide and Great White Hunter, living in Malaya during the years just prior to World War II. Operating out of the Raffles Hotel bar in Singapore, Frank donned pith helmet and ventured forth every week to deal with the baddies of Southeast Asia, ranging from smugglers and warlords to spies and strutting Nazis. There was a real Frank Buck, a famous animal trapper in the 1930s and '40s. However, any resemblance between the real Frank Buck and the character portrayed in this series was completely coincidental.",
