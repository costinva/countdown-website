  "overview": "Whether we work there as a teacher, study there or drop our children off there every morning, the school leaves no one indifferent. Depressed teachers, stressed parents and happy schoolchildren, Pep's takes us back into the daily life of this infernal triangle. In front of the gate, in the canteen, in the corridors or in the classrooms, relationships intertwine for the better... and often for the worse!",
