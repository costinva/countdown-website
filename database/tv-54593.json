  "overview": "The main character, the \"Eternal Stenz\", is the 50-year-old Munich detective and bon vivant Franz Münchinger. Münchinger, lives happily with his wife Annette von Soettingen in Munich-Schwabing. He loves his city and he loves his wife Annette, whom he affectionately calls \"Spatzl\". And Annette loves Monaco, even if she comes from much better circles than him. But Monaco also loves adventure. He has a burning interest in the female sex and he also maintains more or less stable relationships with other women, which Annette is well aware of. His best friend Manfred \"Manni\" Kopfeck, who, like Münchinger, works as a detective commissioner for the Munich police, regularly helps him initiate these affairs and hide them from his wife in an amusing way. Monaco's wife Annette runs an antiques shop and - according to her parentage - is in the so-called better society, with which Monaco can only partially identify. This contrast often leads to humorous situations, for example when Monaco tries to avoid going to the opera.",
