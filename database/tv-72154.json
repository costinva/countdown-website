  "overview": "Biel is one of the residents who has been working in a public hospital for several months. Hundreds of shifts, thousands of hours, which barely leave him time for his life. But it is his vocation and he is willing to do whatever it takes to become the best doctor. What he does not imagine is that a total strike will break out in the hospital, with no minimum services. The doctors are forced to do this to try to raise public awareness of their essential work and to protest against all the intolerable cuts that the public health system is suffering. But Biel and the other residents do not know whether to go along with this strike that could have fatal consequences for patients. And from this conflict we will get to know each of them in their day to day life: who are these young people who go out of their way in the hospital, assuming excessive responsibility, and who are these adults willing to lose everything in order to fight for what they believe in?",
