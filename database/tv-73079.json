  "overview": "Using his trademark wit, host Graham Norton will oversee the 10 comedic stars, brought together to make each other laugh by using every unpredictable comedic tool in the box … without cracking a smile themselves. With the added bonus of some celebrity cameos, their performances will have viewers - but hopefully not their fellow stars - laughing out loud. As the clock counts down and the tension rises, whoever can outlast their competitors will be crowned the first winner of LOL: Last One Laughing Ireland and win a grand prize of €50,000 for their charity of choice. ",
