  "overview": "The Million Peso Money Drop is a game show wherein at the beginning of the game, the contestants are given one million Philippine pesos divided into 40 bundles of 25,000 pesos in 20-peso bills. They must answer eight multiple-choice questions by placing their money on a trapdoor in front of their selected answer. They may split their money on multiple trapdoors if they are not sure of the answer. However, one trapdoor must always be left empty. Any money placed on a wrong answer or left unplaced on a trapdoor is dropped and removed from the contestants' total.",
