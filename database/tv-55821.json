  "overview": "You, Me &amp; My Ex follows five couples who deal with an ex who is still intricately connected to their past partner and very much a part of their daily lives. Viewers will watch these couples navigate the uncomfortable and awkward moments when a past love is still front and center. Relationships, marriage and children are no longer one-size-fits-all as the couples in this series redefine the norm, break the rules and forge their own paths towards the lives and families they want and dream of.Viewers will get a first-hand look into the unique advantages and challenges that come with having an ex be the third wheel in a relationship. We'll see one couple renew their vows with hopes of both of their exes attending, two exes get matching tattoos and one former pair living together with a new girlfriend and coexisting under one roof. Will these couples be able to juggle a third in their relationships – or will the past resurface and become too much to handle?",
