Who are we? What do we want? What is the meaning of our existence? How are we arranged? What does and doesn't a Ukrainian do? What is the mission of Ukrainians in this world?Instruction.UA is an online tablet on the new worldview YouTube channel \"Anthropology\" from Suspilne Media. A show with Ivan Semesiuk, where he and his guests seek answers to these questions.The guests of the show are experts from various spheres of Ukrainian life: from culture to business, from humour to war, and from history to politics.
