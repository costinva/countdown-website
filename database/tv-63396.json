  "overview": "After Happily Ever After, Bow Wow will throw a Singles Party with a new group of potential prospects for the daters. These parties, however, are only attended by the Ex-spouses so that they can determine who might be best suited for their former partner. The Exes will invite one of the prospects to move into the house to date their former spouse for 48 hours. At the end of the two days, the dater will then decide if they will keep the prospect or send them back to the singles pool and have another opportunity to meet someone new. Are Exes the most equipped candidates to help these daters meet their next love? In this environment, will old feelings resurface while watching their former partner fall in love with someone new? Will they realize their Ex is still the one? Or will they find a new love in their after happily ever after?",
