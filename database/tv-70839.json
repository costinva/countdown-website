  "overview": "Actor and writer David Harewood fronts brand new, two-part series, Dickens in Italy with David Harewood (w/t), as he follows in the footsteps of one of the world's most famous writers and his little-known journey through Italy's most beautiful cities. Reframing the idea that Dickens was a quintessentially English writer, David will uncover Italy's influence on Dickens' writing style, political beliefs and its personal impact as he traces the novelist's Grand Tour through Venice, Naples, Genoa and Rome.",
