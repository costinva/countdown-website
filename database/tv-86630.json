  "overview": "ЖК «Сімейки» is a comedy premiere about our lives. The plot is centred on a chat between a house and the families who live there. Every day, they discuss topics that are important to them and resolve issues that every Ukrainian faces: everyday problems, family relationships, children's education, work and daily news. But despite all the heated debates and difficulties of today, the characters resolve situations with humour and positivity. That is why ЖК «Сімейки» is a light story that viewers love so much and which is so lacking in these difficult times. A special feature of the new STB series is that the actors play several characters from different families at once.",
