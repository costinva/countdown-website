  "overview": "Set in Melbourne's outer-west suburb of Sunshine, the story follows Jacob Garang played by new on-screen talent Wally Elnour. Jacob is a young, aspiring South Sudanese-Australian basketball player whose dreams of climbing his Biblical namesake's ladder to heaven - the American National Basketball Association â€“ hang in the balance when he's drawn into a criminal investigation. Police are hunting down the perpetrator of a violent assault, which has left a young teenage girl in a coma fighting for her life, and a group of young men fighting for their innocence.",
