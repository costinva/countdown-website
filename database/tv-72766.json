  "overview": "Douglas is Cancelled introduces us to middle aged, and greying, current affairs news anchor, Douglas Bellowes, a respected broadcaster and raconteur who loves the life he's created with his newspaper editor wife, Sheila. Whilst an experienced broadcaster for Live At Six, behind the scenes Douglas surprisingly needs constant reassurance from his sharper, younger, tech savvy, social media aware co-anchor, Madeline, who appears to be able to wrap him around her little finger. His life is privileged as he's regarded as a national treasure and apparently, can do no wrong, until he makes an ill-advised joke at his cousin's wedding, which is overheard by a fellow guest, who threatens to expose his comments on social media.Speculation is rife and during the on-going hysteria and digital storm, Douglas's alleged indiscretion is dissected, analysed and blown out of all proportion.Everyone appears to have an opinion and Douglas is struggling to escape the controversy.  It's a chaotic and unmanageable situation, but can Douglas count on the support of his agent and colleagues? What will Douglas do next?",
