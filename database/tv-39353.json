  "overview": "Michelle Ackerley whisks a pair of property buyers off to the seaside to help them realise their fantasy of moving to a home on the UK coast. She takes them on a tour of four tantalising properties in their chosen hot spot. Does the reality match the fantasy?In each location, Michelle indulges our dreams of living like a millionaire as she takes us around a wow property worth in excess of a million pounds, surprisingly affordable for a short stay especially if the treat is shared with a group of friends. And on the other side of the coin, she hunts down three fantasy find properties on a shoestring that could also yield an income when rented out.Fantasy Homes by the Sea presents the beautiful backdrop, stunning vistas and dreamy lifestyle that we all hanker after, as seen through a real life property hunt.",
