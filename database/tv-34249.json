  "overview": "In this brand-new and exclusive six-part series author and historian, Guy Walters, reveals how Hitler had already started to implement plans of world domination long before the war had started and explores how the Fuhrer intended to carry them out regardless of the human cost.Until 1942, no one could have predicted the outcome of the Second World War. But one man was in no doubt that victory was inevitable, in fact Adolf Hitler was so confident of winning he didn't just go to war with soldiers, guns and tanks; he also went with the blueprints for a whole new world.Each episode of the series follows Guy as he investigates a different aspect of the Nazi post-war plan for a new world order: from how Hitler began constructing buildings on a truly colossal scale for his new world capital to how a new and expanded Germany rising out of the ashes of conquered Europe would have meant slavery for millions. Guy will also show how Hitler had started to take over America from the inside, revealing large-scale support for the Nazi regime in the land of the free.",
