  "overview": "ID takes the real-footage murder genre to the next level with What Lies Beneath. In addition to real footage--CCTV, police interrogations, and home videos--included is completely new: gripping footage from inside the courtroom of the murder trial. What Lies Beneath uses the courtroom footage as tantalizing flash-forwards to tease the audience with key clues as each story unfolds, keeping viewers guessing until the end about the testimony: is it truth or lies? Is the person speaking a witness or a killer?",
