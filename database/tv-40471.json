  "overview": "In #BOOS, Tim pulls all the bells, bells and fanfare out of the closet. Because you're angry. And he will fix it for you. And what you can be angry about? Everything. For example that your package has not arrived, your neighbor always lets his dog poop in front of the door or your boss has fired you for no reason.",
