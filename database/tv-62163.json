  "overview": "Amanda Holden and Alan Carr will be moving countries for their biggest project yet â€“ they're heading to the sunny south of Spain where they'll take on a rambling, run down property in the province of Andalusia for the third series of their hugely popular series where they renovate ageing properties.With many rural areas suffering from de-population, they're hoping to remedy this and bring the tourists back by highlighting some unloved and forgotten areas around the Costa del Sol, in Amanda and Alan's Spanish Job.",
