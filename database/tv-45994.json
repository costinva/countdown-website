  "overview": "Chronicling the fortunes of four generations of a London theatrical family through the 1920s and '30s, The Bretts ran for two memorably successful series during the late 1980s. An Upstairs Downstairs of the theatrical set, it stars Norman Rodway as the effusive, charismatic Charles Brett and Barbara Murray as his strong-willed wife Lydia. With scripts from veteran screenwriters Rosemary Ann Sisson, Bill Craig, Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, this set features both acclaimed series.It's 1927, and thespians Charles and Lydia Brett are at the peak of their careers. Intending to capitalise on their success by acquiring their own theatre, will this bid for creative freedom ensure their family's theatrical legacy?",
