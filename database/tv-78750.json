  "overview": "It's widely recognized as a terrorist organization, responsible for many atrocities including the Beirut port blast and destabilization of Lebanon. But 42 years on, the ‘Party of God', remains stronger than ever. It has transformed itself from a small paramilitary group backed by Iran into an omnipotent political party with the largest private army in the world. A 'state within a state', whose extensive charity network ensures the popular support of the Shiite community while its military wing attempts to redraw the borders of the region and erase Israel from the map.",
