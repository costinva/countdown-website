  "overview": "This gripping three part documentary series exposes a global conspiracy that plunged the world into crisis. Black Gold is the story of the coverup of the century: of the boss atop a trillion dollar industry who discovered a shocking truth 40 years ago, created a black ops campaign to hide the evidence, and stopped at nothing to keep the money flowing, as the world burned. Among the characters in this thriller about the plot to trade our planet for profit are a CEO nicknamed \"Iron-Ass;\" whistleblowers from Exxon's own labs; professional climate deniers; a NASA scientist and a US Vice-President.",
