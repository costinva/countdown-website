  "overview": "Forensics: Murder Scene is a groundbreaking observational documentary series which takes the viewer behind the blue police tapes at the crime scene. It tells the inside story of how the expert Forensic teams work alongside West Yorkshire Police to solve and prosecute murders, on the scene as soon as the crime is reported.Â With unprecedented access to both teams, cameras follow the crime from the 999 call, tracking the work of scientists, forensic experts and Major Crime Team detectives to piece all the evidence together for prosecution.We go inside the murder scene itself, see the evidence as it's discovered in the critical hours after the events take place. More compelling than a drama, more real than any other factual series, new high-end technology combined with expertise and knowledge, provides a definitive look into the world of CSI, where no stone is unturned, and every death literally leaves a deadly trace.",
