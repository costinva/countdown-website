When he spots 19-year-old Jeremy Peeter's hacking skills at a computing convention, he knows this shy teenager is the key to making it happen. Together with Alidor's expert team, they mastermind a plan that is as ingenious as it is daring: to hijack the digital highway of money transfers that run between banks.",
