  "overview": "Michael Shayne is a private detective who solves crimes in Miami, Florida. The hour-long filmed mystery series, based on the detective novels of Brett Halliday, stars Richard Denning as a worldly private-eye who is equally at home in the gutter or glitter of Miami's Strip, and whose interests range from tall drinks to open cars. Patricia Donohue co-stars as Shayne's secretary, Lucy.Â ",
