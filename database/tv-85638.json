  "overview": "Tsuyoshi, a 22-year-old third-year university student, spends his days juggling classes and his food delivery job, with a can of strong chuuhai always within reach. Living alone in a small apartment, his mundane routine takes an unexpected turn when he finds himself entangled with Yui Koriyama, a married woman he has admired since childhood. What begins as an innocent connection soon escalates into something far more intimate, blurring the lines between longing, desire, and morality.Set against a backdrop of quiet nights and stolen moments, this risqué yet comedic tale explores the thrill and complications of an illicit romance—where every encounter is both intoxicating and dangerous.",
