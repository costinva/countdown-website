  "overview": "Based on the story of Italian journalist and writer Oriana Fallaci. Set in the late 1950s, this season follows the early career of Oriana Fallaci, when she was still known as \"the girl from the movies\" and worked as a reporter for the Italian weekly magazine L'Europeo. It was during this time that Fallaci turned her first trip to the United States into a unique opportunity, meeting extraordinary figures and painting a sharp, often raw and ironic, portrait of American culture and the reality behind the glamorous fa√ßade of Hollywood. These years were also marked by deep personal turmoil, including an intense and troubled relationship with fellow journalist Alfredo Pieroni. This relationship, full of passion but also insecurities and fears, eventually dragged Fallaci into a spiral of self-destruction. Above all, it was a period when a young woman with extraordinary determination and talent discovered her true mission: to tell the truth. And she realized that to do so, all she needed was her most powerful weapon: her voice, unique and distinctive.",
