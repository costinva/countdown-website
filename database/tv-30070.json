  "overview": "Mega Engineering takes you into the heart of some of the world's monumental future projects. Using spectacular CGI, witness the virtual construction of these mega structures and learn about the obstacles and challenges that must be overcome, and how technology is advancing today to accommodate the needs of these awe-inspiring structures of tomorrow.Humankind is on the verge of a new era of mind-blowing global engineering projects that make today's most ambitious constructions look like child's play. Inflating the designs of masterminds to the largest proportions, Mega Engineering supersizes a geodesic dome to cover the entire city of Houston, stretches an underwater tunnel farther than ever before to connect continents, and contemplates new solutions to turn our massive seas into floating, habitable land space.Mega Engineering kicks off with projects that seem impossible and ideas borne from science fiction, but seeing is truly believing as we are taken around the world to visit sites that shoulder the toughest engineering challenges. Grab a front-row seat at the drafting table as visionary engineers, designers, architects and scientists aim to warp past today's limits and formulate real solutions to bring their extraordinary visions ever closer to fruition.",
