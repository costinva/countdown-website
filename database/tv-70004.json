  "overview": "Big RV Remix brings the \"wow!\" factor to small spaces on wheels, transforming dull and drab into unique and luxurious. At Celebrity Trailers, co-owned by Big Boi (Outkast) and Janice Faison, the team creates one-of-a-kind builds, while under the pressure of looming deadlines and varied budgets. Whether it be an out of this world landing pad for a future astronaut, a cutting-edge mobile shop for an up-and-coming barber or a hot new bakery bus for kids, they've got it covered. Together, with their go-to contractor, David Vasquez, the crew transforms trailers, campers, sprinters, and anything on wheels into celebrity level mobile marvels.",
