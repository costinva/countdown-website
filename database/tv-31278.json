  "overview": "A futuristic comedy series about eight vaguely courageous and easily \ndistracted military personnel who journey to the far reaches of the \ngalaxy, seeking knowledge, adventure and whatever else they can come up \nwith. On board the O.S.S. Oklahoma, this legion of misfits are led by a \nlackluster captain who would rather be planning the next \"Margarita \nMonday\" than leading a mission against evil, much to the exasperation of\n his by-the-book executive officer.",
