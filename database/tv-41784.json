  "overview": "The world's elite independent watchmakers are incredibly passionate about watch making from design to assembly, delicately bringing together hundreds of minuscule parts all by hand. The price for one such truly artistic timepiece can fetch up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Their phenomenal techniques stretching the limits of human capability are almost divine. Examples of their mastery include a watch that uses only wooden parts except for the springs, a watch without hands or a face, and a watch that shows celestial movement. This documentary series goes deep into the workshops of the world's expert independent watchmakers.",
