  "overview": "Nol Ratsamee is a heartbroken, woman-hating, completely introverted, angry, handsome young man. His former girlfriend screwed him over and left him for his best friend, and took his money. His depressive state and views on love and women garner the attention of his younger sister, who is very concerned, so she teams up with her bubbly/cheerful best friend Reuangrin Narokmon to find him a girl and to make him be â€˜happy' again. Reungrin moves into their home as a maidservant to get close to Nol, to know his habits and likes, so that she can play his matchmaker. But a problem arises, and Reuangrin begins to fall for Nol.",
