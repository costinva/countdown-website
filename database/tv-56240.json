  "overview": "Du Xiao Su is a wilful entertainment reporter who impersonates as a nurse and sneaked into a hospital ward to snap a high rising star's photo after a car accident. She bumps into Shao Zhen Rong, a suave doctor on duty and that begins their bitter sweet love relationship. Du Xiao Su met Shao Zhen Rong's family to discuss their marriage and realized to her horror, Shao Zhen Rong's second brother Lei Yu Zheng is none other than the guy who had a one night stand with her years ago! Much to Du Xiao Su dismay, Lei Yu Zhen forbade her relationship with Shao Zhen Rong.",
