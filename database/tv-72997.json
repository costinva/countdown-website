  "overview": "Aimed at understanding the jobs of the \"Ice Rangers\": these men and women who manage the practical aspects of the Princess Elisabeth polar station on a daily basis. What drives them to the idea of coming to isolate themselves on this basis? How do they manage to manage their emotions and their private lives? This daily life will be juxtaposed with scientific missions and challenges and, therefore, more universal questions to understand why it is important to continue research in this white continent and what challenges for tomorrow this represents at the planetary and climatic level.",
