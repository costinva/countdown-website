  "overview": "When a small plane traveling from Guatemala carrying a small group of passengers, crew and a pilot crashes in the Mexican jungle, all the bodies are recovered and placed in a morgue. But it turns out that only one of them died in the crash. The other passengers were murdered afterwards, each one in a unique way. But by whom? And why? As the story unfolds in flashback, we meet the survivors as they fight against the heat, a shortage of supplies, the many dangers of the jungle…and each other. The setting becomes increasingly tense and claustrophobic as, one by one, they are dispatched with a series of shocks that bring us ever closer to the truth and – at the very end – a jaw-dropping reveal.",
