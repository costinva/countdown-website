  "overview": "BIG3 Basketball is a brand new sport that begins it's inaugural season on Sunday, 25 June 2017. BIG3 Basketball is a 3 on 3 league that is being formed by celebrities Ice Cube &amp; Michael Rapaport. The half-court league will consist of former retired NBA stars such as Allen Iverson, Jason â€˜White Chocolate' Williams, Chauncey Billups, Kenyon Martin, Charles Oakley, and other former players to be named at a later date.It's going to be interesting. Names we all know but guys well past their prime playing a 3-on-3 half-court game similar to what you and I have played in pickup games on the blacktop. Well, except the Big 3 has a four-point shot. There will be games packed into 10 cities on sort of a barnstorming tour, with the teams playing all games back-to-back each in the same venue. FOX Sports will broadcast the games the following night. The league championship game will air on 26 August 2017 live on FOX.",
