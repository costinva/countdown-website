  "overview": "Each week, hosts Joey Fatone and Mel B surprise an office, hold an impromptu audition - in front of their co-workers - to create a team of the five best singers, and help them prepare for their time in the spotlight. Then, it's off to the stage for a choreographed sing-off to earn a spot in the finale and a chance to win $50,000. No office is safe this summer!",
