  "overview": "In 1959, Maria Luiza is a rich and dutiful woman who has always depended on her father and husband. After being left alone in Rio, against her better judgment -- and to the chagrin of her strict father -- Maria Luiza decides to stay in the city and dedicate herself to turning her husband's property into a Bossa Nova club. In this passion-driven transformation in Maria Luiza, she will be inspired by liberal and feminist new friends: Adélia, Lígia and Thereza.",
