  "overview": "In this spin-off of the TV Funhouse cartoons on SNL, our host Doug hosts a show on a set that resembles Blue's Clues if it wasn't computerized. He picks a theme for the day (Caveman Day, Western Day, Astronaut Day, Mexicans Day) and encourages his \"Anipals\" (His animal puppets) to do stuff for the day that corresponds with the theme. Of course, they never do and get themselves in crazy situations like going to a Tijuanese Bordello and Doug is stuck on the set all alone. There's also Robert Smigel cartoons and mock-educational films! Robert Smigel is best known as the voice of Triumph The Insult Comic Dog which is originally from Conan O'Brian.",
