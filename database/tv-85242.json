  "overview": "In a small peaceful desert town, residents mysteriously start spontaneously combusting. Mimi, a mine clearance company instructor, believes these cases are not caused by landmines, but by a phenomenon she experienced in her childhood â€“ where a deep sense of loneliness ignites a deadly inner flame. Along with her childhood friend Dikla, a police officer in the local station, they investigate the spreading phenomenon trying to track down who is behind it and stop them from terrorizing the serene town.",
