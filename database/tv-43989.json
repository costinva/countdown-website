  "overview": "Set deep in the backcountry of one of the largest, most dangerous and incredibly scenic stretches of unfettered land in the country lies the Frank Church Wilderness, also known as \"The Frank.\" The only direct way to access this rugged region of Idaho is a daring flight through steep canyons on a bush plane or a harrowing jet boat journey through Class 5 whitewater rapids on the Salmon River, also known as The River of No Return. Within the 2.3 million acres of secluded wilderness lives a small community dependent on the pilots, boat captains and each other to survive. River of No Return follows this tight-knit community of homesteaders as they endure challenging and isolating winters in order to remobilize their extraordinary lives in the stunning, remote wilderness come spring.",
