  "overview": "September 19, 1985, Mexico City. What began as a typical Thursday turned into one of the country's greatest catastrophes when, at 7:19 a.m., an 8.1 magnitude earthquake shook the nation's largest city. Dozens of buildings collapsed, streets and avenues were covered with debris and injured people, while the government froze in the face of a disaster that struck on the eve of the World Cup. Cada Minuto Cuenta intimately portrays the people who lived through the tragedy firsthand, but above all, it tells the story of how heroes and heroines were forged, keeping the catastrophe at bay and making every minute count in their rescue efforts.Â ",
