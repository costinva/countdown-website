  "overview": "The Royle Family's dad and son Ricky Tomlinson and Ralf Little reunite years after they last got together, for a heart-warming and hilarious staycation, travelling the length and breadth of northern England, in a quest to unlock each of its region's own unique secrets.From the banks of the urban Mersey to the beauty of the Lakes, from the steel works of Sheffield to the chocolate makers of York, and on to curry houses, football clubs, steam trains – and the Angel of the North, it's a fascinating route rich in natural beauty, culture, cuisine, sport – and, of course, humour…They meet some old friends from the world of showbiz – and make new ones at every port of call – as they explore what makes the people in this part of Britain so special. They also reflect on how life has changed them as individuals – and the North itself – over the 20-odd years since they first met.",
