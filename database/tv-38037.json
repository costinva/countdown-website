  "overview": "In this tournament-style competition, America's top shops compete for a chance at glory and a $100,000 grand prize. Each episode features two rival garages (from Los Angeles, Detroit and Atlanta) going head-to-head in a battle to build whatever challenge is thrown at them, whether it's turning a minivan into a high performance super car or creating a submersible vehicle. Each team has only 40 hours to complete their build before the real competition begins - testing their vehicle. The goal is to win each round, eventually making it to the finals and taking home the cash. Hosted and judged by master builder Lou Santiago and professional driver Andrew \"ACP\" Picard - with the design category judged by legendary designer Chip Foose - this will be the Ultimate Car Build-Off.",
