  "overview": "Safari Vet School is the challenge of a lifetime for 32 vet students, the cream of UK universities, who are at one of the toughest vet schools in the world. At the Amakhala Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, the students are about to undertake vital wildlife training on their quest to become the best vets they can be. Under the guiding hand of chief vet Dr Will Fowlds, the students will tackle everything from lions to rhinos, giraffes to elephants. For some it's the first time they've seen these iconic species and for all of them it's the first time they've had to treat wild animals. From the classroom to the bush it's a physical and emotional journey as they face fear, danger, drama and are challenged beyond anything they have experienced before. Accompanying the students is popular vet and TV presenter Dr Steve Leonard. He's their guide and mentor as the students cope with the tears and terrors of being a wildlife vet.",
