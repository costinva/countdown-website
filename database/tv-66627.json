  "overview": "The hottest German-speaking singles come together in a tropical paradise for what they think will be the most exotic and erotic time of their lives — but there's a twist. These commitment-phobes who love a casual hook-up, will have to give up all sexy touching for the entire retreat if they want to win the €200,000 grand prize. No kissing, no heavy petting, and no self-gratification of any kind. With every slip, the prize money goes down. In this luxury no-bone zone, will the serial singletons be able to form deeper emotional connections? Or will the temptation simply be too hot to handle?",
