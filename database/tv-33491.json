  "overview": "Mustangs FC is a goal-kicking comedy drama about girls who are abandoning the sidelines and starting their local football club's first all female team. As well as playing great soccer, this girl squad have got to work out how to be a friend. A sister. A daughter. A captain. A good sport. And how all that may be hard or sad or ridiculously crazy or laugh out loud funny. But when you've got your teammates behind you, there's no better feeling than playing like a girl.",
