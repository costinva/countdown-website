  "overview": "What a drag - hanging out all day on a beautiful tropical island with your buddies, sipping coconut milkshakes. Bob, a true New York City dog, suddenly finds himself stranded on an island paradise, a place full of secrets, adventures and unusual inhabitants. Of course, that doesnâ€˜t mean he enjoys it. He is just killing time until the next ship back home passes by... or maybe not?",
