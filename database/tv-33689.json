They married very young and try to carry out a marriage of more than 20 years crossed by a personal crisis and a couple in which the changes that happen in the country and the world are not unrelated. Parents of three children (Ines, 20, Toni, 19 and Carlitos 10), will witness - and we with them - the growth and challenges they face.",
