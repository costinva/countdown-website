  "overview": "The main character, Oleksii, is an employee of a volunteer organization, a talented negotiator, and an analyst. Even before the full-scale invasion, he helped families divided by the front line, facilitated the return of prisoners, and searched for the missing. To achieve his goals, Oleksii never shied away from using any connections, as his ultimate mission was to help. However, in 2022, as he personally confronts the atrocities of the Russian occupying forces and endures personal losses, he embarks on a challenging journey of transformation. His attitude toward the war, worldview, and principles undergo profound changes, ultimately leading to the collapse of his ideals.",
