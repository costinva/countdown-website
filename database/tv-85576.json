  "overview": "Best friends Ben and Janni are so-called late bloomers and are constantly overlooked by women. Therefore, they decide they urgently need to become more \"manly\" â€“ immediately. They contact school dealer Corny, who is supposed to procure them an illegal testosterone supplement from the dark web, which will become their holy grail on the path to \"manhood.\" And indeed, overnight, they develop muscles, become more self-confident, and even manage to outdo the class bully Rick, who also has his eye on the class crush Suki.",
