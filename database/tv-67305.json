  "overview": "Liz Bonnin ventures to one of Earth's last great wildernesses, to reveal fresh insights about its amazing creatures. Joining scientists conducting aerial research, using helicopters, drones, and satellites, Liz will reveal the very latest stories about what's happening to the magnificent wildlife in the far north. She'll come face to face with some of the icons of the Arctic, in the most extraordinary ways imaginable: taking biopsies from wild polar bears, fitting satellite trackers to bowhead whales, and netting a caribou from a helicopter. This is the Arctic, like you've never seen it before! ",
