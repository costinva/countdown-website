  "overview": "Seon Heo is a graphic artist who specializes in creating adult webtoons for a living. In the course of looking for potential recruits, Seon Ho comes across a boy by the name of Mu Yeong, who he decides to hire as his assistant. However, there's just one thing: the moment Seon Ho lays his eyes on Mu Yeong, he finds himself immediately taken by Mu Yeong's cute yet irresistible charm. As the pair begin working together, sparks gradually spark between the boss and his assistant. But it appears that neither Seon Heo nor Mu Yeong have what it takes to confess their feelings for one another.",
