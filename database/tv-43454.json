When Non shows snubbed interest in Kao, it fuels Pete's jealousy. The secrecy and jealousy put a strain on their otherwise thriving relationship. Sun has begun to give up his unrequited with Kao. And suddenly Mork is around a lot more. Whilst Sun pushes Rain to stay away from Mork, the younger man's uncontrollable behavior draws him in. Sun's seriousness is holding Mork down.
