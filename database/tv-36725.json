  "overview": "Made in Mosjøen is a fourth-wall-breaking webseries about fishguns, dead cats and some special cheese. The different characters' more or less offbeat struggles and goals cross and entwine, at the same time as the city of Mosjøen is under threat by a common enemy - litterary pulling people down the drains.",
