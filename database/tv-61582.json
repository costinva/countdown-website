  "overview": "Circle Square is an animated comedy for children 4-6 about a community of nine houses, each home to a character or family. Vanessa the Dragon, owner of the rainbow lighthouse, helps out with everyday dilemmas and each episode features a different friend in need of her help (and sometimes she needs theirs!)The households in the community include a yeti, a family of emergency service owls, a keyboard and a drum, a family of wizards, a grumpy dog, an elderly adventuring bear and a couple of walking, talking pine trees. Their companionship also extends to neighbouring islands in the archipelago of the Wyndley Isles, and to friends and family who come to visit them..",
