  "overview": "Without claws, venom or razor-sharp teeth, humans are physically under matched with our wildlife counterparts. Given these natural disadvantages, a confrontation with an animal can easily turn deadly. However, there are times when a size or power advantage can't overcome a much stronger opponent - a person's will to live. I'm Alive features the inspirational stories of people who are determined to survive an animal attack regardless of the obstacles or consequences. In an instant, a chance encounter with an animal can take away life, but these victims decide to reclaim their lives.",
