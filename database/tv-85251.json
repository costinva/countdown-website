  "overview": "For a neighborhood as renowned for its spectacular holiday displays as Evergreen Lane, the street has long been modest when it comes to Halloween.  But when fun and spooky new neighbors, Luna and Marvin move to the block, Emily, Jared and the rest of the HOA agree to get in on the seasonal fun and launch EverSCREAM Lane to fundraise for a local charity.  As the block pulls together to plan creepy contests, spine-chilling décor and a spooktacular carnival, new haunted hijinks ensue with Pamela, Ned, Mary Louise and the rest of the block. Through the process, Emily rediscovers the joys of the holiday that she and her late grandmother once cherished.",
