  "overview": "Otto Olsson has cracked the love code. At least he has managed to convince an investor that he did. Because who would say no to a dating app that finds your perfect match through artificial intelligence? Hack my heart is about some high school students who decided to conquer the world. The school becomes the lab and the students the guinea pigs. In the center stands the entrepreneur, the prankster and the problem child Otto. To show the school, his father and the whole world what he's up to, he enlists the help of the hacker Mira. His only friend Tor gets to do the grunt work and the YouTuber Julius is enlisted to sell the app among the credulous kids at school. It seems that Otto is onto something because the dating suddenly takes off. The algorithm seems to work. If there is any catch? In that case, it would be that everything is based on a scam. Hack my heart is a dramedy about dreams, code and broken hearts.",
