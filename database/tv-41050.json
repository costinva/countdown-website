  "overview": "Little Birds is set in Tangier in 1955, in the famous ‘international zone' - one of the last outposts of colonial decadence, and a culture shock in more ways than one for troubled American debutante Lucy Savage. Thrilled to escape her controlling parents, Lucy arrives full of anticipation for her marriage to her English fiancée, Lord Hugo Cavendish-Smythe little knowing that Hugo has already lost his heart to someone else. As Lucy fights to carve out her independence and identity, her life becomes intertwined with Cherifa Lamour, a Moroccan dominatrix who services the diplomats and foreigners of this colourful, bohemian world and Egyptian Aristocrat Adham Abaza – and they all become entangled with some very dangerous characters.",
