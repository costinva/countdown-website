  "overview": "SpaceVets was a 39-episode children's sci fi show about a motley crew of misfit intergalactic space vets. The concept was devised by Stephen Edmondson and Jerome Vincent, but the characters were created by writer Christopher Middleton, and most of the 39 episodes written by him, too. Music for the series was produced by former Doctor Who composer Dominic Glynn.",
