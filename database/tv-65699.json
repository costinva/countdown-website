There she meets a future emperor, who coincidentally looks like her favorite idol, Wang Zheng. Since Yao Liang Liang appears at a crucial time for the king, they make a pact. He'll give her money which she needs, and she'll act as his betrothed whom nobody has seen before their arranged alliance marriage. But as they help each other gain what they want, they also fall in love.",
