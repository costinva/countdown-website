  "overview": "One season out of the year, the East Coast becomes the \"Ice Coast\", and the party moves from the beach to the mountains. Serving as a rite of passage for young people who want to get away for a winter break, Hunter Mountain is an idyllic ski resort that offers twentysomethings the chance to escape their regular lives, ski and snowboard their hearts out and mingle with other likeminded singles. Winter Break: Hunter Mountain will document the lives of eight young people who connect over their need to getaway -- and the impact their winter together has on their lives.",
