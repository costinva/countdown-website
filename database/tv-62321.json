  "overview": "To commemorate the 50th anniversary, CNN reexamines the Watergate affair and the anatomy of the infamous break-in that started it all - this time told firsthand by John Dean, former White House Counsel to President Richard Nixon, in the CNN Original Series, Watergate: Blueprint for a Scandal. Produced by Herzog &amp; Company, it is an immersive look inside Nixon's inner circle and the schemes behind closed doors by the Committee to Re-Elect the President that would eventually unravel his presidency. Across four revealing episodes, Dean divulges more than he ever could under oath, shedding new light on the back-channeling, the back-pedaling, and the backstabbing. Featuring rich archival footage and interviews with key insiders who had a front-row seat to the biggest presidential scandal of the 20th century, this series questions if America has learned anything since Watergate or if we as a nation will repeat the past. ",
