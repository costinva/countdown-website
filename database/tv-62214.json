  "overview": "At 39, Nozue realizes that by letting himself be carried away by his daily life, he ended up locking himself into his routine: metro, work, sleep. But as they approach their forties, the employee has neither the desire nor the energy to try to evolve. It is Togawa, his 29-year-old subordinate, who shakes up his habits by offering him one day to go snack on pastries in an establishment particularly popular with young girls. From one snack to the next, Nozue feels rejuvenated... But is it really the effect of these delicacies or rather that of emerging feelings?Â ",
