  "overview": "The girl Xian was raised by Hui, a single mother who runs a photo studio. By chance, Xian followed her lover Cong to the studio, which attracted the attention of boss Meng of the film company, and her life's destiny changed. Boss Meng took advantage of Xian's purity and yearning for an actor's identity to give her the glory of a star and emotional dreams. Later, in order to protect himself during the war, he abandoned Xian, who was already pregnant. Mother Hui also passed away sadly because she could not bear the betrayal of her emotional support Lao Wang. The nostalgia for her daughter Zhi has become Xian's only hope for survival. Time flies, Zhi has grown up, and she falls in love with her classmate Zou Jie, who also works in the shipyard. Due to their background, the love of this young couple was hindered. However, the two people who pursued progress still walked firmly together. Xian, who has reached middle age, reunites with her long-lost former lover Cong, and they renew their relationship and love each other for the rest of their lives. The life situation full of joys and sorrows finally cleared up all the misunderstandings caused by the collision of ideas between the two generations, and the mother and daughter ushered in their own beautiful lives together.Â ",
