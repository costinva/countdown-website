  "overview": "Following the lively Abrams, a modern-day family with a twist, the show features lovable matriarch Bobbi Jo and her husband Jerry Abrams and their 84 kids, but only three of them are human!

Their extended family includes a zebra and camel as well as kangaroos, alpacas, llamas, wallabies and a recently adopted sloth. Throughout the series, viewers will get a chance to tag along with this lovable, blended family as they navigate the everyday joys and challenges that come along with raising children, while also managing the havoc that naturally arises as a result of tending to a house full of animals.",
