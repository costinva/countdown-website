  "overview": "America is in the grip of a constitutional death match so grave, so outrageous, and so fast-moving that it's almost impossible to process it all. The Impeachment Show is here to help - it's your guide to the forces and people that brought our politics to the boiling point. Hosted by Emmy award-winning VICE News correspondent Michael Moynihan, the show explores the impeachment moment with wit, verve and genuine curiosity, combining documentary-style field pieces, news-making interviews, humor, and panel discussions with rotating special guests.",
