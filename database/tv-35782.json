  "overview": "Impressionists Rory Bremner and Debra Stephenson lead as team captains as they are joined by the UK's favourite mimics and comedians. Both teams will go head-to-head in a number of fast-paced games and challenges where they must provide a variety of impressions--as they re-enact iconic movie scenes, re-voice news footage, blast out some surprising cover versions and put unlikely words in the mouths of all kinds of celebrities.",
