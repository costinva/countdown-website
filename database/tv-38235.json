  "overview": "America's culinary boundaries are about to be shattered as Smithsonian Networks introduces Bug Bites, a six-part, short-form series exploring the worldwide art of cooking and consuming insects. Nutritious, protein-packed and easy to sustainably farm, bugs are regularly eaten by 30 percent of the world's population, and while most of North America has yet to fully embrace this culinary delight, U.S. foodies are beginning to take note. Bug Bites takes viewers into four notable chefs' kitchens to explore traditional methods of preparing high-end insect delights, from grasshoppers to scorpions, as well as cutting-edge recipes curated for the modern palate.",
