  "overview": "Over four million Brits have abandoned the rat race to be their own \nbosses, but most of us are too overwhelmed by the staggering number of \npossible new opportunities to make such a big change. By using the same \nprinciples found in comparison websites, Carlton Hood, former CEO of \nConfused.com, helps separate the emotion from the important factors and \nguide families towards a future that will work for them. Carlton reveals\n how much families are worth, gets them to decide what their priorities \nreally are, and helps them to make potentially life changing decisions.",
