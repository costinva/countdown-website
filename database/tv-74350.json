  "overview": "Against a backdrop of the Republic of China era, fraudster Master Kwan is good at disguising himself as a Taoist priest. He flees to Five Races Town as he gets into trouble. Meanwhile, Kwan's shenanigans – on the pretext of something to do with god Lu Dong-bin – have alarmed Great Master Luzu, who decides to go to the mortal realm to punish him. Through force of circumstance, Dong-bin is stranded in the mortal realm as he loses his mystical power. And then Dong-bin adopts Lui Shek as his new name while keeping Kwan company so as to help him get back on the straight and narrow. During the process, they solve bewildering cases in the village. A mortal and an immortal run into a prostitute called Pak Suet-fa, and they get entangled. Headman Sun Fu steps down. Kwan covertly prevents bully Kam Shi-ho from standing for election. Newly elected Headman Sun Ching-yee implements reforms as he deals with bad deeds committed by Shi-ho. A series of calamities is triggered in Five Races Town.",
