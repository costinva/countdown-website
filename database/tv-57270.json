  "overview": "Fifth-year students Anton and Kuza, who were retained for the second year, were fortunate. Their old dorm is being demolished, and in the new building they are placed in a block with three girls - Kristina, Masha and Yana. Michael also returns to university as a graduate student - to avoid the army. The guys have become older and... more romantic. Now they want not only sex and parties, but also real feelings. However, inducing reciprocity among ladies is not as easy as it seems.",
