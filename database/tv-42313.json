  "overview": "From the cold northern tip of Norway to the hot south of Spain; from the wild sea coasts of the European West to the continental extremes of the Urals in the east to the gentle heart of the continent — the landscapes of Europe are as unbelievable as they are different. They are full of secrets and surprises.The geologist Colin Devey now embarks on a journey across the old continent: he travels to the most amazing landscapes and biggest mysteries of European nature. In doing so, Colin Devey pushes his limits: he wanders, swims, climbs or jumps — all to get the best view and the most incredible insights.",
