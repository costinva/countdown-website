  "overview": "Christmas Cookie Matchup kicks off with a pool of two-person teams, with each consisting of one home baker alongside a different star from When Calls the Heart. In each episode, Chadwick Boyd and Emily Hutchinson will judge as the contestants go spatula-to-spatula in a variety of Christmas cookie and holiday dessert competitions. One team will be eliminated each week, and in the end only one pair of cookie connoisseurs will prevail, with the top home baker winning the $25,000 grand prize.",
