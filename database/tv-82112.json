  "overview": "The definitive GAA sports series returns to TG4 for a 23rd series. The series' hour-long format has proven a huge success, bringing each player's personal stories to the screen. The series features eight Laochra with star quality and reveals deeper, fresh and sometimes genuine unexpected insights into the lives of these icons. While their sporting careers continue to provide the backdrop to the story, the series travels well beyond the four white lines. Gripping personal stories will compel viewers to travel towards the territory unique to the GAA television landscape.",
