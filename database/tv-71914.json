  "overview": "Éléonore St-Laurent is a lawyer of convictions and arguments. Jacob Gravel-Duquette is an investigative journalist and follows his instincts no matter where they lead him. Each in their own way, sometimes by joining forces, they denounce the flaws of the system, supporting individuals revolted by the slowness or rigidity of institutions. Through their fight against institutional absurdities, Éléonore and Jacob help these desperate individuals obtain a semblance of justice.",
