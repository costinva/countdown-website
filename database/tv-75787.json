  "overview": "Ichiro is a PE teacher in 1986 feared by his students for a \"tough love\" approach, harsh tongue and frequently \"inappropriate\" behavior. He's also a dad trying to raise a rebellious daughter after having lost his wife to illness. When he gets transported in time to 2024, he encounters modern sensibilities that teach him about empathy, but also gives people of today reason to rethink their own political correctness in this time traversing comedy about change.Â ",
