  "overview": "When a fugitive skips court and goes on the run, bail bonds companies are on the hook for the money. To motivate bounty hunters to find the accused and recover their cash, these companies create competitions. Bounty Wars tells the stories of these real competitions. In a race against the clock, three bounty hunting teams from California-based Bad Boys Bail Bonds are given five days to put a list of accused in custody while earning big bucks for taking big chances.",
