  "overview": "The UK has some of the lowest body image scores in the world. Over a third of us admit we're unhappy with the way we look. In Naked Beach, social psychologist Dr Keon West and body image expert Natasha Devon MBE have devised a radical experiment that could help those who hate their bodies to learn to love them again.In each episode three 'Guests' with critically low body image jet off to a sunny Greek retreat to live with a group of unclothed, body confident 'Hosts', who have little more than elaborately designed body paint to cover their modesty.",
