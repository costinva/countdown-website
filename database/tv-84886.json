  "overview": "The main characters are only fifteen or sixteen years old at the beginning, having left primary school and starting high school. They are no longer children and they are ready to jump straight into everything. They are going through a period of rebellion against parents and teachers, a period of searching and disappointment, first fateful loves, friendships and enmities. Different types of people meet in the classroom. They have different interests, attitudes, family backgrounds, dreams and different ideas about how to spend their free time. Some are skateboarders, others are nerds, some live for music, others for computers. There are athletes and intellectuals among them. Some are sociable, others are withdrawn. Chatting, computer games and virtual reality are more important to some than real friendship.",
