  "overview": "What does our future look like? Lieven Scheire creates in Can Anyone Still Follow? light in the darkness. Floating tunnels, robots that do somersaults, a mattress against adultery, the erasing of traumas and tattoos, trash cans that arrange your groceries or fingernails with which you can pay. Together with his panel, Lieven outlines what our lives will look like in 2019, in 2030 or in 2050.",
