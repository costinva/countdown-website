  "overview": "From the rom-com-worthy Playboy Club romance that comes to a screeching, fatal halt, to the centerfold girl who gets tangled up with a serial killer – The Playboy Murders expose the pitfalls of fame for those that appear in their storied pages.  Equal parts nostalgic and shocking, this anthology brings compelling murder investigations to life, while also exploring cultural attitudes about sex, love, and fame.",
