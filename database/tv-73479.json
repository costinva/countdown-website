  "overview": "Embedded in the turbulent history of the 1980s, \"Reeperbahn Spezialeinheit FD65\" tells the story of the first German police team dedicated to fighting organized crime. The focus is on pimps, prostitutes, police reporters, politicians, the red light district of Hamburg's Reeperbahn and the cat-and-mouse game between department 65 and their dangerous opponents. These include u. the 'godfather of St. Pauli' Wilfrid Schulz, the US mafia and corrupt police officers, rival pimp gangs, the Hells Angels and the 'killer of St. Pauli', who hits the F65 in the heart with a series of murders that is still unbelievable to this day.",
