  "overview": "After a year and a half of investigation, the police \"Department for Special Investigations and Combating Organized Crime\" managed to arrest Željko Matić Željco, a former gangster who legalized his business and used it to launder money earned from illegal activities. The arrest was spectacular, but it was overshadowed by the murder of the outgoing chief of the Šibenik-Knin Police Department, Petar Mikulandra, and the discovery of the body of Gabriela Ochoa from Mexico, who had been presumed dead for seven years. The chief's murder casts doubt on the connection between the police and organized crime.",
