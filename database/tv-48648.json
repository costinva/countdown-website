  "overview": "The series examines what the 2010 U.S. Census identifies as the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States. Told through individual lives and personal histories, Asian Americans explores the impact of this group on the country's past, present, and future. Led by a team of Asian American filmmakers, including Academy Award-nominated series producer Renee Tajima-Pe√±a, \"Asian Americans\" examines the significant role of Asian Americans in shaping American history and identity, from the first wave of Asian immigrants in the 1850s and identity politics during the social and cultural turmoil of the twentieth century to modern refugee crises in a globally connected world.",
