  "overview": "The teacher of the Semyonov Faculty of Philology, the most spineless being on the planet, is possessed by an alien whose ship has crashed. To his horror, the alien learns that humanity is burning oil, which was created by scientists of their more advanced civilization as a cure for all diseases. He wants to warn the \"tribesmen\" so that together they can clear the Land of \"pest people.\" But to do this, you need to repair the ship in a quiet place. However, he is not allowed to retire by Semenov's daughter Alyona, his ex-wife Katya, the dean, the commandant, a ufologist, and a strong passion for his colleague Anna Mikhailovna.",
