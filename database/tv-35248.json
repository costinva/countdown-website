  "overview": "Making It brings together eight of the country's most talented Makers to tackle a variety of handmade projects with the hopes of impressing hosts Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman as well as judges Simon Doonan, Creative Ambassador for Barneys New York, and Dayna Isom Johnson, Etsy trend expert. Every show will revolve around a central theme that draws inspiration from hugely popular nationwide trends in crafting and DIY, which the whole family can enjoy. Each episode of the competition will consist of two projects, cleverly designed by Poehler and Offerman, that test the Makers' ability to think outside of the box in unpredictable ways. Believing there is no better way to express yourself than by making things by hand, the challenges are also designed to bring out skilled insights and takeaway, touching personal stories and lots of laughs.",
