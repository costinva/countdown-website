  "overview": "Addicted to Marriage follows the lives of four intriguing women who love to get married. Meet Monette, Shae, Amy, and Kecia, who collectively have been down the aisle a total of 20 times! Each marriage enthusiast is ready to say \"I do\" again, but are the men in their lives ready? Some of the women know exactly what they want in a future marriage while others struggle with their pasts. One of the brides-to-be has a list she refers to as the 'Triple A': attention, affection and appreciation whereas others grapple with revealing how many times they've said 'I do' because of their lurking insecurities of potentially failing at yet another marriage. The women know they trust quickly and love hard but the relationship highs are often met with intense drama and scrutiny by the men they love. Will their willingness for a happy ending with Prince Charming push the men in their life away or will they finally have the happily ever after they have been longing for?",
