In a world where global travel is the norm, the Earth's most devastating diseases are never more than a plane ride away. Killer pathogens constantly are evolving, increasing in strength and numbers. Every day, deadly diseases like West Nile, Monkey Pox and MRSA mutate at a rate that far outpaces modern medicine. Every one is vulnerable, but medical science is not without heroes. From small town doctors at community hospitals to top scientists at the Centers for Disease Control, the battle is being waged on all fronts. In a mortal battle against a ticking clock, doctors and specialists must work together to uncover the source of mysterious illnesses.
