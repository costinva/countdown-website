  "overview": "Twenty-four civilian recruits take part in a gruelling Special Forces selection course designed by former members of Ireland's elite Special Forces unit, the Army Ranger Wing (ARW). Welcome to Hell.The Army Ranger Wing (ARW) is one of the toughest, best-trained Special Forces units in the world. They are on standby 24 hours a day, either to deploy overseas or to react to any serious domestic criminal or terrorist threat. This constant high level of preparedness means there training and skills are benchmarked against other elite Special Forces units across the world including the SAS and the Navy Seals.",
