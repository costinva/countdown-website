  "overview": "Kostya, the ambulance driver, is used to living one day at a time. Mired in debt and loans, he couldn't think of anything better than to take the first bus he saw and get away from Moscow and his problems. So he finds himself in a southern village, where he is mistaken for the long-awaited doctor Christopher Sergeevich. The locals welcome Kostya with all cordiality and even provide him with housing. It seems that the guy had the perfect chance to quickly resolve the issue of money and return to Moscow. But pretending to be an experienced healer without understanding anything about medicine is not an easy task, so Kostya will have to somehow get out of it.",
