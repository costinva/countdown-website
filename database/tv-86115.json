  "overview": "Police friends Roma and Bodya investigate crimes and constantly compete with each other. But they learn what real rivalry is when a new investigator, Alisa, joins their team - bright, smart, witty. The girl will not join herself - but with her shepherd dog Alf, who will significantly strengthen the team. The smart four-legged will bring humor to the police routine, as well as his own understanding of who is theirs and who is a stranger. Will the dog Alf become a full-fledged player, will he actively participate in investigations or will he remain \"on guard\"?",
