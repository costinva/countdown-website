  "overview": "A big cellar? A post-globalization hyper-colonist? An authentic character!! Three short films and three feature films later, Bob Gratton's character has left his mark on Quebec cinema for twenty-five years. The best Elvis impersonator, turned pop music star, even found himself at the head of a media empire. The suburban garage created by filmmaker Pierre Falardeau is one of Quebec's mythical characters. Bob Gratton is a must! After a prolific career in cinema, our friend Bob will live his joyful adventures and misadventures in a series of thirteen episodes on TV. He has already conquered moviegoers and it will soon be the turn of viewers to attach themselves to this man who denounces, sometimes in spite of himself, certain enormities of our society. Fasten your questions! Bob is coming and he doesn't have his tongue in his pocket... s'tie! ",
