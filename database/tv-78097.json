  "overview": "By the age of 30, ex-stripper Mara acutely feels a crisis of self-realization. To prove to everyone around her that she can do more than just strip for money, the girl decides to go into business and persuades her former sponsor Yurich to let her manage a beauty salon. Mara becomes the manager, not of a beauty salon, but of a dilapidated car wash on the outskirts of the city. Will a former stripper be able to master a new social role and make a not-so-successful business profitable?",
