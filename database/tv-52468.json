  "overview": "Bombing War: From Guernica to Hiroshima takes us around the entire world, as no region was spared: the free countries, such as those occupied by Axis forces. Seen from the skies, the war is revealed in a new light. The story of an insane race for power and destruction, which drained the wealth of nations, mobilised the most brilliant scientific minds, and left a world in ruins. In this new form of warfare, the first victims were civilians. The world that emerged from WWII would be changed forever. Overcome by its own technology, humanity would now be confronted with its ability to destroy itself.",
