  "overview": "Pat LaFrieda Jr., the \"Magician of Meat\", has revolutionized the burger and meat industry. Running a third-generation wholesale meat-purveyor business in New Jersey with his cranky dad, Pat Sr., and his smooth-talking cousin, Mark Pastore, Pat and his family have built the company into a meat empire. But with big business comes big problems. Whether it's last-minute requests, creating burger blends and menus for new clients, dealing with difficult customers or navigating the personalities of a 500-person work staff, Meat Men takes viewers on a high-\"steaks\" ride with a side of humor, served medium rare.",
