  "overview": "Since the dawn of civilisation, mankind has created treasures that celebrate and revere their leaders. Yet the fall of Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome left the whereabouts of many of their greatest riches unknown: plundered, hidden or lost to time. These lost worlds captured the imaginations of the greatest philanthropists, collectors and even governments of the day.With vast investment explorers, such as: Andrew Carnegie and Lord Caernarfon, mounted expeditions to go in search of the great treasures of the ages. From the Valley of the Kings to the depths of the Aegean Sea, no expense was spared in the pursuit of these priceless, mythical objects. Yet the pursuit of them sometimes came at the ultimate price",
