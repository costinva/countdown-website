In pursuit of regaining her human form, Mo Bing searched for a millennium and finally discovered the \"Heart of Flame.\" However, its owner, Mu Yuanqi, held a triple identity just like her. When Mo Bing forcefully married into his household, a series of tests and tensions unfolded. Slowly, a drama filled with purpose and conspiracy, both sweet and torturous, began to unfurl.",
