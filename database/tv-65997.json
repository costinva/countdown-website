  "overview": "A new spin-off collaboration between \"Hospital Playlist\" cast members Jo Jung Suk, Jeon Mi Do, Jung Kyung Ho, Yoo Yeon Seok, and Kim Dae Myung and producing director (PD) Na Young Suk. The show follows the format of Na Young Suk's \"Three Meals a Day,\" where celebrities rent a house in the countryside and cook their own meals from scratch. The format of \"Three Meals a Day\" is that a small celebrity cast goes to live in a countryside house and make their own meals, often farming or fishing for their own ingredients. In one teaser, just like the previous versions of the show, Jo Jung Suk, Jeon Mi Do, Jung Kyung Ho, Yoo Yeon Seok, and Kim Dae Myung build their own cooking fire, harvest their own apples and turnips, wash their own dishes, and eat the meals that they cook themselves.",
