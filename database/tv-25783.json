  "overview": "It seems impossible. Young people, with the briefest experience of life, prepared to kill and in some cases, kill their own parents. But it has happened in many countries and in many ways. Are these teens inherently evil, or are they victims of a system that failed them? Featuring key witness testimony, new interviews, archive footage and reconstructions, this series explores such questions through eleven extraordinary cases.",
