  "overview": "\"Investigative Comedy Show\", in which the Berlin comedian Mario Barth devotes himself to the often senselessly destroyed tax money of Germany.\n\nWith both a visible and a hidden camera, Barth and his team go about research and question those responsible. The cheeky comedian is supported by five other prominent detectives. Star chef Steffen Henssler, comedian Ingo Appelt, TV lawyer Christopher Posch, reporter Johanna Maria Knothe (\"Bambule - the magazine\") and cabaret artist Florian Schroeder stand by his side and present further examples of wasted money.Â ",
