  "overview": "Xie Quanjia, a farm girl from a small town who came to Changle City in search of her father, overnight becomes the heiress of the local magnate, Li Tiandi. However, she soon discovers that instead of inheriting vast fortunes, she has been left with massive debts. At her wit's end, several individuals meet at the Li residence: the noble young creditor Shangguan Guchuan, the scholar Fan Zhongju who's in the capital to take the imperial exams and looking for accommodation, and the young man Liu Lang who comes to repay his debt of gratitude to Li Tiandi. With her father gone and the debts outstanding, Xie Quanjia, while dealing with the pressing creditor, decides to let these men settle in the mansion and rent empty rooms to a princess from the Western Regions and her servant fleeing from an arranged marriage, along with Guo Dongli, a restaurant manager, to alleviate the debt burden. From then on, while living together, each individual dedicates their energy to carving out their own success in Changle. Amidst the chaotic pursuit of their dreams and handling the constant flow of visitors to the mansion, they lead lives filled with unrest yet are ultimately joyful.",
