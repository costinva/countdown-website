  "overview": "The action is set to a backdrop of Sweden facing primitive power outages and ominous predictions about the coming winter. Reluctant widower Arthur gets recruited to help his colleague, star journalist Cristina, who dares to question the mainstream narrative. Feeling cornered by the police and other powers, he becomes her partner-in-crime, in the craziest, most hazardous day of his life â€” the only problem being he has a date with Mille, and as not to arouse any suspicion, it needs to happen as planned.",
