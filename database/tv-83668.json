  "overview": "Everyone knows Patron the dog, but not everyone knows that there are many such little heroes. \"Patron and his friends\" is a Ukrainian project about dogs (and a little about cats!) who serve for the good of Ukraine.They risk their lives to support their home country. Some, like Patron, help to de-mine liberated territories. Others - pull people out of the rubble. And there are also emotional support dogs who will lend a paw in difficult times.",
