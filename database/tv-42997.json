  "overview": "Country Music chronicles the history of a uniquely American art form, rising from the experiences of remarkable people in distinctive regions of our nation. From southern Appalachia's songs of struggle, heartbreak and faith to the rollicking western swing of Texas, from California honky tonks to Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, the series follows the evolution of country music over the course of the twentieth century, as it eventually emerged to become America's music.",
