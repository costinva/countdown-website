  "overview": "The wildlife of America is spectacular, diverse, and constantly transforming, and so is the land it calls home. With each year, seasonal shifts across the nation trigger stories of birth, adversity, courtship, and loss. We track the ebb and flow of life over four seasons--from spring's explosion of new growth and summer's bountiful harvests to autumn's grand migrations and winter's punishing tests--and reveal the day-to-day struggles its inhabitants face as they they try to survive and thrive in America's wild, ever-changing environment.",
