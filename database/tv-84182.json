  "overview": "The drama tells the story of the early days of the newly established Ning Dynasty, where the new emperor, Huo Jingheng, chooses a consort. He summons Yue Ling'er, the sister of the former prime minister of the previous dynasty, Yue Chi, who had been missing for two years, to serve in the palace. Yue Chi, deeply protective of his sister, cannot bear to see her suffer in the palace. He also grows suspicious of Huo Jingheng's recent focus on people and matters from the former dynasty, fearing the emperor might initiate a purge of old officials. To protect his sister, Yue Chi decides to enter the palace in disguise to investigate the situation. However, it turns out that this entire scheme was part of a conspiracy between Yue Ling'er and Huo Jingheng. The plan to make Yue Ling'er the consort was a ruse to get Yue Chi back into the court, where he could help restore his career. Using his wisdom, Yue Chi avoids trouble in the palace, while Huo Jingheng, with a series of calculated schemes including the incompetence of the national uncle, carefully maneuvers Yue Chi into the position of the right prime minister. Despite growing tensions caused by the interference of Princess Jiang Yunqing from the former dynasty, the two men, Huo Jingheng and Yue Chi, form a strong bond of trust while fighting against the conspiracy of the exiled crown prince Yi Qingyun, ultimately resolving both internal and external crises.",
