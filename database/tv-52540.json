  "overview": "A loser college student was having a really bad day: The girl he was in love with only thought of him as her bestie; and he was diagnosed with terminal cancer with only three months to live. Then an alien life form that looked like a yolk body-snatched him. It not only cured his cancer, but it also gave him superhuman abilities. But with the happy surprise came the danger of extraterrestrial kind. For his friends and love ones, he had to overcome his loser mentality and be a hero.",
