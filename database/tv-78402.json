  "overview": "In a small seaside town there is a unique clinic \"Nadezhda\". Spouses Olga and Sergey help women get pregnant - they treat ailments associated with disorders of the reproductive system, as well as infant pathologies. They do wonders in helping women become mothers, but ironically they themselves cannot experience the happiness of giving birth to their own child - a blood baby.",
