  "overview": "Center of the Universe follows John Barnett, a family man who, by default, is the go-to guy for his eccentric extended clan. John, and Kate Barnett, are still very much in love after 20 years of marriage and are looking forward to the next 20. Only one thing interrupts their bliss: John's family. His feisty father, Art, and his loopy mother, Marge, have a penchant for coming over unannounced, ready to stir the pot. As the owner of a security company, John just hired his gleefully oblivious brother, Tommy, who is having trouble wrapping his mind around the concept of \"office hours.\" John's sister, Lily, is a therapist who is her own best patient. If that's not enough, their 12-year-old son, Miles, has the makings of a perfectly nutty third generation Barnett. As the family patriarch, John fights an uphill battle with Kate's help to keep the peace while his oddball family spins around him.",
