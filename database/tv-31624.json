  "overview": "Ironworking is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. No matter the weather, iron workers walk steel beams hundreds of feet off the ground and the higher you build, the stronger the wind. Besides fighting the wind, snow, and rain, an iron worker in New York has to battle the East Coast bone-chilling cold. This series follows the workers of the worlds most respected ironworking unions - New Yorks Local 40 and Local 361.",
