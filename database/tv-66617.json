  "overview": "Drops of God is set in the world of gastronomy and fine wines, which are in mourning as Alexandre Léger, creator of the famous Léger Wine Guide and emblematic figure in oenology, has just passed away at his home in Tokyo at the age of 60. He left behind a daughter, Camille, who lives in Paris and hasn't seen her father since her parents separated when she was nine years old. When Camille flies to Tokyo and Léger's will is read, she discovers that her father has left her an extraordinary wine collection – the greatest collection in the world according to the experts. But, to claim the inheritance, Camille must compete with a brilliant young oenologist, Issei Tomine, who her father took under his wing and is referred to in Léger's will as his \"spiritual son.\" But is his connection to Issei only spiritual?",
