  "overview": "Linda is a Manchester girl, born and bred. She's in her early 30s and \nthe friends she has now are the same friends she's had since primary \nschool. By day she potters around in Craven Lane Motors selling cars and\n flirting with mechanics. But when night time comes around she can \nusually be found singing her heart out on stage at the Lee Lane Social \nClub. Her best friend Michelle may be settled and happy with her \nboyfriend and kids, but Linda's single and loving it. She may not have \nfound Mr Right just yet, but she's having a whale of a time while she's \nlooking.",
