  "overview": "Moscow is a city where speed decides a lot. No one is waiting for anyone here. To achieve something, you need to be constantly on the move here. This defines the concept of the show. In each episode, 15 new participants challenge Moscow and its speed. Some of them have already achieved something here (stars), some are just at the beginning of their journey (ordinary people), but they are all on equal terms, and the rules are the same for everyone - you are a fugitive, and hunters are following you. If you can escape, you'll take a large sum. If you get caught, the game is over. Here, everyone decides what to do: unite or be a loner. Try to hide or go ahead.",
