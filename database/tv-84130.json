  "overview": "Vicky Pattison and Lucinda Light welcome a cast of hopeful singles to a radical new dating experiment. The daters enter Truetopia, a sunny and romantic paradise, in pursuit of true love. There's just one rule: Do not lie! While the daters explore romances with their matches, they are regularly tested by the dreaded Honesty Box - a state-of-the-art lie detection system that asks probing questions about their true feelings. If they tell the truth, it could affect their newly formed relationships, but if they lie, it will reduce the £100,000 'Trust Fund'. As Truetopia's very own Sincerity Coach, Lucinda guides the daters, encouraging each of them to discover and share their inner truth. And at the dramatic Truth Terrace, Vicky reveals the Honesty Box results to the group. But can the daters work out who has lied and cost them money from the Trust Fund? ",
