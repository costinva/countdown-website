  "overview": "Insomnia follows career driven Emma Averill whose life takes an unexpected turn. Just weeks shy of her 40th birthday, Emma finds herself ensnared in a web of sleeplessness, echoing her mother's own past struggles. But as the past resurfaces, so do haunting doubts and fears. With her mother's sudden hospitalisation, the return of her estranged sister, and an unnerving sense of being watched, Emma is thrust into a realm where truth is not what it seems... the past never sleeps.",
