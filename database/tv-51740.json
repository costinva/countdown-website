  "overview": "Eight of the fastest teams in America fight for a winner-takes-all purse of $100,000 - the highest payout in street racing history. Welcome to Street Outlaws: Fastest in America, an all-new series where the best of the best descend on Memphis for a shot to ultimately take on JJ Da Boss and the MSO - with the winner bringing home the big money prize and the prestige of being called the baddest on the streets. High intensity, insane pressure, and extreme emotions rule in this ultimate Street Outlaws showdown, and only the best street racing team will make it to the finish line. Handpicked by JJ Da Boss, street racing bosses from South Carolina, St. Louis, Kentucky, Mississippi, Detroit, NOLA, Texas and the Northeast - each claiming to be king of the streets - have assembled their teams in Memphis for the chance to prove their racing chops once and for all. With both small and big tire cars, a mixed bag of racers including Texas' Birdman, NOLA's Kye Kelley, and Detroit's Chucky Davis, Street Outlaws: Fastest in America is the ultimate faceoff.",
