  "overview": "100 candidates have to prove their talent in a total of 99 rounds to ultimately win the prize money of 99,000 euros in the grand duel. On the way there, the candidates have to face a mixture of skill, athleticism and cleverness: This includes popping a champagne cork as far as possible, playing tug-of-war against each other, unrolling toilet paper as quickly as possible, melting a block of ice or assigning songs to the right decade. One candidate is eliminated after each round.",
