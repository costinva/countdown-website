  "overview": "All over the world, people report they've been visited by aliens, taken aboard spaceships and medically examined. The authorities appear to know all about these visits but won't acknowledge it publicly. This film focuses on two 'victims' who struggle to live normal lives, but the aliens keep coming back. All is explained (perhaps ?) at the end.",
