  "overview": "Introducing celebrities from the worlds of hip-hop, sports and Hollywood to the competitive ranks of mixed martial arts (MMA), Iron Ring showcases mixed martial arts -- the fastest-growing new sports format in entertainment. The show pairs celebrity team owners, trainers and fighters to produce some of the most compelling match-ups on television. Headlining the show is boxing champ Floyd Mayweather (with the assistance of hip-hop star Rick Ross) managing the Money Mayweather Boys, along with hip-hop heavyweights Ludacris and Nelly representing Team Luda and Team Nelly (respectively); T.I. with the help of Big Kuntry, Young Dro, DJ Drama and Alpha Omega leading Team Grand Hustle; Juelz Santana and Jim Jones heading Dipset; and Lil Jon with the Head Busters.With $100,000 in prize money up for grabs, these skilled competitors go toe-to-toe in the Iron Ring using the combined fighting techniques of jiu-jitsu, judo, karate, boxing, kickboxing and wrestling. From competitive team tryouts and grueling practices to the final face-off at the live championship, Iron Ring not only exposes the hardcore sport of mixed martial arts, but also uniquely explores the human element by providing insight into the lives of the fighters and coaches.",
