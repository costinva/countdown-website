  "overview": "From the moment Bob Hawke blazed onto the national stage, he was the rock god of Australian politics. Never short on self – belief, he propelled himself head and shoulders above the crowd to become the most popular Prime Minister we'd ever had. But what kind of leader was Bob Hawke? And what are the lessons for today?Now with unprecedented access to Bob Hawke and intimate first – time accounts from those who were by his side, this two – part political biography takes a revelatory look at the times and the leadership that made us who we are today. The result is a rollicking journey through some of the most tumultuous decades in Australia, made more timely by the 35th anniversary in March 2018 of Bob Hawke winning government, and the current crisis of confidence in Australian political life.",
