  "overview": "Shen Zhuoran, a retired literature professor, lives a seemingly content life with his children and grandchildren. After the passing of his beloved wife, he embarks on a journey of matchmaking, encouraged by an old friend. Along the way, he meets four very different women: a kind-hearted head nurse who parts ways with him over a property dispute, a scientist who vanishes after her cancer returns, a domineering union director who smothers him emotionally, and a woman who resembles his late wife but makes a difficult request. Each encounter brings Shen Zhuoran not just emotional challenges but also personal growth. His reflections on love and life ripple through the family, quietly shaping those who have stood by his side all along.",
