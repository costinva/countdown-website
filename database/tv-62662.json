  "overview": "A Godwink can be an unexpected connection to someone you love, a mysterious pathway to a life-changing opportunity, unanticipated income out of the blue, or an answered prayer that makes you say \"wow\"! Godwinks let you know that God is always extending you a tangible connection to Him, like a firm handrail on dark, wobbly stairs.",
