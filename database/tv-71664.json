  "overview": "I Have Nothing follows Carolyn Taylor on a quest to choreograph the perfect full length pairs figure skating routine to Whitney Houston's 1992 iconic hit song \"I Have Nothing.\" Motivated by a teenaged obsession for the 1988 Calgary Olympics (but with no skating knowledge or ability), Carolyn is aided and abetted on her figure-skating journey by BAFTA-winning actor and comedian Mae Martin and Emmy-winning figure skating choreographer Sandra Bezic.",
