  "overview": "The Bisexual explores the differences between dating men and women from the perspective of a person who finds herself doing both.New Yorker Leila is feeling lost in London having just left a ten year relationship with girlfriend and business partner Sadie. Moving out of their beautiful, shared apartment, Leila ends up renting a room from neurotic novelist Gabe, a man living in constant fear of missing out and dwarfed by the success of his debut novel which came out 13 years ago and has long been forgotten. Leila finds an unlikely wingman in the form of Gabe. He helps her navigate a new life dating men and women â€“ and Leila, in return, introduces wide-eyed Gabe to the queer scene whilst doing her best to help him decipher his unreadable, sort-of-girlfriend Francisca. As Leila comes to lean more and more on Gabe she finds herself struggling to come out as bisexual to her gay friends.",
