  "overview": "This time Dawid Andres will take us on a journey through Vietnam. After driving along and across the United States, Dawid Andres will discover Vietnam for us. We will find out what it is like to work in a transport company in South Asia. David will travel kilometers of dangerous and difficult routes from Hanoi, through Haiphong, Saigon, to the Mekong Delta. Apart from the locals, apart from the Vietnamese police, in not always social circumstances. He will visit places more and less popular with tourists, such as the demilitarized zone, the U Minch National Park, a floating market or an abandoned water park. There will also be meetings with the local cuisine and culture, of which Dawid will certainly pass on to viewers.",
