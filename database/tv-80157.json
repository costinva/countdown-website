  "overview": "TV cook and award-winning food writer, Donal Skehan immerses himself in the lives and kitchens of people of various faiths, to discover how the food we eat – and choose not to – expresses who we are and what we believe. In his pursuit of culinary enlightenment, Donal spends time with Hare Krishna, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Orthodox Christian and Sikh communities and reflects on the traditions and beliefs he wants to pass on to his own family as he explores notions of ‘food for the soul' from all angles.",
