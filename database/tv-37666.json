  "overview": "Our Shirley Valentine Summer will see Melinda Messenger, Sian Lloyd, Nancy Dell'Olio, Aggie MacKenzie, Ninia Benjamin, Lizzie Cundy, Annabel Giles and Ingrid Tarrant, escape to a Greek island for the summer â€“ rediscovering themselves and even looking for love. Under the glow of the Mediterranean sun the cast will live together under one roof, as they discover the islands, the challenges of communal living and the ups and downs of dating. They are all single and at a crossroads in their lives. All of them harbour a passion to try something new or pursue long held dreams in an attempt to transform their lives, for the better. Sharing a desire to work out what to do with the next chapter of their lives, some want the opportunity to learn a new skill or test drive a new career.Each of the ladies has a personal goal, for example, overcoming a marriage breakdown, losing weight, building self-confidence and many of them will spend time dating. For some, it could be their first date in a decade, whilst others are looking for someone special to spend the rest of their lives with.",
