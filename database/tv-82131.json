  "overview": "Explores the harrowing claims of child abuse in the sleepy town of Wenatchee, WA. In 1995, the wholesome \"Apple Capital of the World\" was rocked by appalling allegations that adults in the town were running a child sex trafficking ring dubbed \"The Circle,\" which abused more than 60 children at various locations around the town. After dozens of arrests, more than 29,000 counts of child abuse and 1,000 combined hours of prison sentences, the truth emerged: None of it ever happened.",
