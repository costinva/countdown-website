  "overview": "Based on Anne Rice's iconic and bestselling novel, Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire follows Louis de Pointe, Lestat de Lioncourt and Claudia's epic story of love, blood and the perils of immortality, as told to the journalist Daniel Molloy. Chafing at the limitations of life as a Black man in New Orleans in the early 1900s, Louis finds it impossible to resist the rakish Lestat de Lioncourt's offer of the ultimate escape: joining him as his vampire companion. But Louis's intoxicating new powers come with a violent price, and the introduction of Lestat's newest fledgling, the child vampire Claudia, soon sets them on a decades-long path of revenge and atonement.",
