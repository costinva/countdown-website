  "overview": "For 21 days, men and women - who meet naked in front of the cameras - will form pairs and will be challenged to survive in one of the most inhospitable environments in the world. No food, water or clothing. After the success of the first season of Largados e Pelados Brasil, a new group of Brazilians will have the chance to explore an extremely challenging region! They will have to overcome physical and mental challenges that increase day by day.Â ",
