  "overview": "Kugel, the captivating prequel to Shtisel, takes viewers on an emotional journey into the lives of Nuchem and Libbi, father and daughter, set in Antwerp's Orthodox Jewish community. Nuchem, played brilliantly by Sasson Gabay, is a witty jewelry dealer whose charm lies as much in his storytelling as in his trade. His daughter, Libbi, portrayed by Hadas Yaron, is a seminar teacher yearning to make her mark in the Orthodox literary world.",
