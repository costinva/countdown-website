  "overview": "Bravo's new event series, In a Man's World will follow four women as they temporarily morph into men to see how the other gender lives. With the help of the Academy Award-winning Special Effects make-up team of Lou and Dave Elsey, as well as voice and movement coaches, these women will be trained on to walk, talk, and look like men in order to go undercover for two days to experience what life is like for guys.",
