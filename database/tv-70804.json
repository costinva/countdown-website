  "overview": "The last 100 days of World War ll are under the spotlight in the 3-parter Countdown to Surrender. It recounts crucial milestones in the last days of the Third Reich and its steady decline towards the inevitable capitulation. Major events provide the context for more intimate and personal fates and give real insight into life at the cutting edge of history. By following the countdown chronologically, the series brings to life the horror and trepidation that marked the end of the Nazi era, and the sense of all-consuming desperation that increasingly took hold among common people. Soldiers caught on the hellish frontlines and the leaders clinging on to delusions, whatever the cost. It ends with an overwhelming sense of relief for most Germans by the end of the war, and a release from devastation, death and disarray.",
