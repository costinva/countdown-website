  "overview": "During an attack by robbers at the museum, Vadim is injured. This event awakens an unusual gift in him — now he can hear objects and even respond to them. The therapist wants to help Vadim and sends him to the owner of the antique salon, Inga Leonidovna, to protect the rented items. The voices of strange interlocutors do not subside: the superpower helps the main character not only to achieve success at work, but also to find love.",
