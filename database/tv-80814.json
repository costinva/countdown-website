  "overview": "Melanie, a young woman who seemed to have everything, lost everything in her life. Just because driving through a tunnel with a 'time distortion' caused her life clock to disappear for a year! Everything she ever had, everything she ever got But her life was changed. It was someone's fault that caused it to be so. She received a 'special thing' instead of an apology, a 'watch necklace' that can turn time forward or backward five times. But with one condition, if she wants to change the date, she must 'kill' one life to use it to get through.",
