  "overview": "Polina and Aglaya are two friends who work in the circus. Polina is a gymnast who grew up in an orphanage. Once she receives a house from an unknown admirer as a gift, her relationship with her best friend is hopelessly ruined, because Herman, with whom Aglaya is going to get married, turns out to be a self-interested person and starts courting Polina. When Herman is found dead, Aglaya appears to be the suspect, because she allegedly had a motive for the murder. But Paulina does not believe in the guilt of her friend and begins her own investigation.",
