  "overview": "Our planet generates an incredible amount of natural phenomena. From luminescent, electric-blue waves crashing ashore to mysterious fairy circles as far as the eye can see, all are seemingly miraculous in their existence. Some can be reasonably explained, but others baffle even the most experienced of scientists. This series takes us on a journey around our vast planet to discover just how strange and unaccounted for our world can be. Welcome to our Impossible Planet.",
