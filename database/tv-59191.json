  "overview": "Catastrophe strikes on a morning swim. Sarah, the single mother of two teenagers, vanishes beneath the waves. The mystery of her disappearance is the catalyst that hurls her fractured family back together. At first her siblings, Ursula, Den and Claire, fear their shambolic sister's vanishing could be her latest stunt. They arrive to discover she has bulldozed half the house. Problem is: it's their house too. A house full of childhood laughter and haunted memories that start to unravel as they embark on life in the rubble, attempting to parent two kids who are desperately hoping their mum will return. The family rages against the purgatory of not knowing their loved-one's fate. Was Sarah drawing up plans for a bright future – or trying to erase a troubled past? There are doors this family never opens but now they must. A story as funny as it is tragic, Significant Others is a searing account of how five disparate souls put the pieces back together after shock loss. ",
