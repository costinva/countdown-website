  "overview": "For centuries, a whale has been swallowing sailors, explorers, scientists and tourists. Now, they're all stuck together in a dysfunctional community inside the whale with neighbors they never asked for. The Blubburbs follows a handful of whale dwellers as they plot to escape the whale, deal with new characters the whale swallows, and generally try to tolerate each other's nonsense.",
