And courage and determination, multiplied by strong fists, effectively neutralize them. His partner Vasin helps to find the necessary information from the Network and phones of victims and intruders. Dolbunov turned out to be the main irritant in the team: he is the employee who talks a lot and does not really do anything.

Besides work, Emelya has a purely friendly relationship with Masha Likhacheva. In moments of sad reflection, he goes to Masha for advice, who is well versed in both crimes and amorous affairs.",
