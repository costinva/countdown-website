  "overview": "Comedienne Carol Leifer, whose wry wit has earned her praise as a writer for both Seinfeld and The Larry Sanders Show, brings her slightly skewed view of reality to Alright Already. In her first lead television role, Leifer plays a savvy, single businesswoman who's just opened a Miami optometry shop with best friend Renee. Here, Carol tries to remain sane as she copes with her nearby mother and father, girl-crazy brother and younger sister who seems to be developing a strange liking for Vic Damone. Combine all of this to the many romances of Renee (who has never met a man she didn't like. a lot), and you get a pop culture comedy that finds big laughs in little moments.",
