  "overview": "Eul Ji Hae Yi, a lawyer at a well-known law firm, is known to flatter those who hold power and looks down upon those who do not. She does everything within her power to win her cases and this results into her being promoted to Senior Partner. Her boyfriend Ki Yoo Jin works as a family medicine doctor. He on the other hand seems like a gentleman with a very cruel secret. Eul Ji Hae Yi heads down to Room No. 9 in the prison's visitation area to meet Jang Hwa Sa, a death-row convice, in which their bodies are exchanged somehow.",
