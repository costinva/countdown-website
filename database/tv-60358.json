Every day, he is scolded by senior doctors for not being able to do something or know something. Ameno Ryuji feels helpless when he sees patients and their families, because the patients and their families think he is a doctor. Ameno Ryuji feels he is unable to satisfy their expectations. He cries over patients that he is unable to save, but he never loses his strong will and passion to become a doctor. Ameno Ryuji grows into a real doctor with his fellow doctors-in-training.",
