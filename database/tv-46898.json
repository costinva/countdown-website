  "overview": "Jorge Chavez International Airport, Lima, Peru - Peru's largest airport and a major Latin American hub. The biggest security challenge here: cocaine trafficking. And anti-narcotics police work 24/7 to bust the latest ingenious scheme: ingested capsules, drug-infused clothes, hidden compartments, and much more. Watch the action first-hand through exclusive access to some of the airport's most restricted areas.",
