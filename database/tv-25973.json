  "overview": "A comedy series about Chris Woods, a stay-at-home father with young children whose wife, Linda, has a demanding career. When Linda graduates from law school, Chris decides to leave his sales job and do the thing he's always wanted to do -- be a stay-at-home dad to his children -- 13-year-old Shannon, 12-year-old Max, 5-year-old Jake, and infant Emily. He loves the \"dad\" part of the job, but confronts every small irritation -- parents, telemarketers, obnoxious neighbors -- head on. Linda's well-meaning but annoying friend Barb keeps advising him on how to raise his kids and friend Holly tells him constantly how tough stay-at-home parenting can be. Chris also has to defend his domestic situation to his dense best friend Rod (Barb's husband) and his new neighbor, ex-Marine Bobick.",
