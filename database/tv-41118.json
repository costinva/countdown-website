  "overview": "Some crime scenes are so dreadful that law enforcement pray to forget them, but Detective Pat Postiglione has the gift of a photographic memory. Coupled with a laser sharp eye for evidence and a brain that is trained to detect microscopic clues, this detective is one of the most valuable minds on the force. With over 25 years of experience as a Nashville homicide detective, Det. Postiglione has seen hundreds of crime scenes, and he remembers each as if it happened yesterday. The victims live on in his consciousness, and the details remain ingrained in his mind. For some, this might be haunting, but for Det. Postiglione, it's his life's calling.",
