  "overview": "Each episode of Sports Gone Wrong blends comedic commentary with archival footage to break down jaw-dropping sports debacles — from controversial rule-breaking athletes and over-eager fans stealing home runs to infamous on-air moments, out-of-control fights, public scandals, unlikely injuries, and more. Salley, Godfrey, Smetana, and Virzi react to questionable NFL team theme songs; test Michael Jordan's cologne; play \"Shaq Fu;\" give their take on the infamous 1996 Orioles-Yankees Jeffrey Maier playoff game; pick sides in the 1984 Copa del Rey final brawl; and much more. ",
