  "overview": "Adam Vollmann is 40 years old, he is a journalist for the web editorial staff of a major national daily newspaper. One morning, the portrait of Axel Challe, designated as the main suspect in the murder of a young girl, in Guerches-sur-Isoire, appears on the television screen in front of him. When he insisted to his editor-in-chief to go straight away to report there, he explained to him that he was from there, that he grew up there. What he doesn't say is that he knows Axel Challe well: he was his friend. Even more, Axel Challe was the demigod of his childhood.",
