  "overview": "You never know where and when you might face an air raid alarm. These are eight different but incredible stories that would never have happened if the air raid alarm hadn't brought their protagonists together in a shelter. Each episode tells a completely new story with new characters, set in different parts of the country. The only thing all the stories have in common is the air raid alarm, which becomes the starting point of the plot.",
