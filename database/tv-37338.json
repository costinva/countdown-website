  "overview": "Haunted Hospitals tells the chilling stories of paranormal activity inside hospitals, nursing homes and morgues. In each episode, doctors, nurses and patients give first-hand accounts of deceased patients who come back from the grave, doctors who insist on tending to their patients, even in death, and spirits who stalk corridors to warn of impending danger. As the personal stories unfold, the mysteries behind the troubled souls and hauntings are brought to life.",
