  "overview": "Chase and Savannah, children of Todd Chrisley -- the domineering Patriarch of Perfection -- look to prove themselves as adults outside of the nest. As the brother-sister duo move to Los Angeles to pursue their dreams, they quickly learn through a series of hilarious misadventures that adulting is not without its challenges. Chase wants to be an actor and Savannah has her sights set on the beauty industry. While living together in the Hollywood Hills, they discover that L.A. is very different from their home in Nashville and with Todd's watchful-eye looming, the pressure is on to grow up or go home.",
