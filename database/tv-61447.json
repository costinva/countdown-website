  "overview": "Hosted by Howie Mandell, Bullsh*t The Gameshow will offer contestants a chance to win big money, even when they don't know the correct answer. Throughout the game, players will work their way up a money ladder either by answering questions correctly or by confidently giving incorrect answers â€“ and persuading their opponents that they are accurate. To win big in this game you don't have to be the smartest person in the room to cash in, you just have to convince everyone that you are.",
