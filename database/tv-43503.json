  "overview": "Regarding criminality, not many genres inspire as much horror and revulsion as that of a serial killer. A predator in the most savage form. A beastly figure usually preying on the weak, innocent and vulnerable. Deeply-embedded negative and sometimes horrific experiences are the usual catalysts for their reign of terror. Take a look inside these murderous minds.",
