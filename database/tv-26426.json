  "overview": "In Inside the Tube: Going Underground, engineer Rob Bell (The Great Fire) explores London's Tube network, where he uncovers the story of how this engineering feat was achieved and the extraordinary characters who made it happen. Granted special access to the secret workings of the Tube, and with the aid of the London Underground staff who know it best, Bell discovers the fascinating hidden history of how London's iconic metro was built. Beginning with the original Tube system built 100 years ago, Bell tracks the history of this famous underground railway system â€” its secret stories, its critical role in events such as the Blitz, and its abandoned stations. Bell also examines the importance of the London Underground in today's world and brings viewers through the tunnels themselves, including at night when no trains run.",
