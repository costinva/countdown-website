  "overview": "Set in modern Britain, Adult Material delves inside the mainstream porn industry from the perspective of a woman who has been working in it her entire adult life and has seen it grow from an illegitimate backroom enterprise to a highly profitable arm of the telecommunications industry. The series will interrogate what's real, what's fake, what's up for sale and the impact that these things have on the individuals involved.",
