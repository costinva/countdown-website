Her world is thrown off kilter when she begins an affair with her new boss David and matters take an even stranger turn when she's drawn into an unlikely friendship with his wife Adele. What starts as an unconventional love triangle soon becomes a dark, psychological tale of suspense and twisted revelations, as Louise finds herself caught in a dangerous web of secrets where nothing and no-one is what they seem.",
