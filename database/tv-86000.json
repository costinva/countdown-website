  "overview": "Gakkou no Kaidan is an anthology horror series centered on ghost stories and urban legends that take place in and around Japanese schools. Each episode presents a standalone tale, often involving students who encounter unexplained phenomenaâ€”such as mysterious disappearances, haunted classrooms, cursed objects, or the lingering spirits of the dead. The stories draw from traditional folklore and modern urban myths, exploring the intersection of childhood innocence and supernatural fear. Though the characters and settings change with each episode, the series maintains a consistent tone of quiet dread and psychological unease, emphasizing the idea that even ordinary school life can conceal terrifying secrets.",
