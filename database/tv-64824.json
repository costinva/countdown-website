  "overview": "Elena Blanco, veteran homicide inspector of the BAC (Case Analysis Brigade), is an intelligent woman obsessed with work, tormented by a dark event from her past. She tries to scare away her ghosts with alcohol, sex and music, while she searches for the culprit in the murder of Susana Macaya, a young gypsy girl who disappeared after her bachelorette party and with whom someone has performed a macabre ritual that reproduces the death of her sister seven years earlier. The great unknown is that Lara's murderer has been serving time since then, so either he has a copycat... or there is an innocent man in jail.",
