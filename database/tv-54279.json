  "overview": "London's Chelsea neighbourhood is a beautiful borough for beautiful people, but it has a dark underside of deception, violence, greed-and murder. Bodies have a way of showing up, and things are rarely what they seem. DI Max Arnold and his partner must root out the truth and bring those responsible to justice, no matter their wealth or status.",
