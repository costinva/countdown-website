  "overview": "Crime comes in many forms: murder; robbery; fraud… There are crimes of passion; crimes of betrayal; and, crimes of rage. The flavors and strands are infinite. They fascinate and shock us with intricacies and unexpectedness – but, they don't happen in a vacuum. Each one reveals a world behind and beyond the crime, often just out of sight…a world we may fear, but may not know or understand. A small town, a hidden subculture, a criminal network, or a place that can never separate itself from a criminal event. In this immersive and investigative new series, Emmy Award-winning journalist Tony Harris pulls back the curtain to reveal the often nefarious players and foreboding places behind the crimes surrounding them. Scene of the Crime with Tony Harris is a six-part reality series.",
