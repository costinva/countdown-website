  "overview": "In the last 50 years our diet has transformed. We've gone from home-cooked meat and boiled veg to convenience foods, ready meals, snacks and drinks of every type and every cuisine. In this two-part series, Simon Rimmer looks back at our favourite foods - from Angel Delight to Smash, Ski yoghurt to Findus Crispy Pancakes and many others - exploring what really went into them and why we lapped them up. With a cast of celebrities who grew up in the 1970s, from Johnny Vegas to Susan Calman, plus interviews with the ad men, food scientists and technologists who created these iconic brands, Rimmer explores how we became a nation of convenience-food lovers.",
