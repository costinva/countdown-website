  "overview": "Four great Italian stories of civil commitment: Libero Grassi, Renata Fonte, Mario Francese and Emanuela Loi. Lived between the end of the 70s and the 90s, in a period full of social changes and transformations, but also of violence and dark plots, these figures have simply and courageously fulfilled their duty as citizens, as men state or journalists. People who despite themselves have become an example of great civil value for Italian society, thanks to their struggles to make our country a better country and paying with their lives for their ideals of truth and justice.",
