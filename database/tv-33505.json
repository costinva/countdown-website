  "overview": "Homicide detective Tikhonov makes an unforgivable mistake - as a result, his partner, friend and mentor gets killed. Tikhonov himself loses sight, but returns to work. Blindness sharpens all the other senses, which allows him to \"see\" what other detectives miss. Now Tikhonov easily cracks complicated cases, but is still being haunted by the past. Is Tikhonov going to solve the most important case in his life and somehow correct his mistake and makes things right?",
