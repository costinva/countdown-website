  "overview": "Sin límites tells the story of the first circumnavigation of the Earth. Captained by the Portuguese Fernando de Magallanes, 239 sailors left Sanlúcar de Barrameda (Cádiz, Spain) on August 20, 1519. Three years later, only 18 starving and sick sailors returned in the only ship that resisted the trip, led by the Spanish sailor, Juan Sebastián Elcano.",
