  "overview": "The Anonymous is a game of social strategy where people are free to say what they really feel behind the safety of a mask.  What would you say and do if nobody was watching you?It is played in two worlds: the real world, where players interact face to face, but also a digital world, where the players communicate behind a mask of anonymity, known as Anonymous Mode. Here in individual private hideouts, each player is free to say whatever they want to advance their game.The question is: Can they stay anonymous or will the other players guess their identity causing them to lose their power in the game? ",
