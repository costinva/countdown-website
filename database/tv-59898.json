  "overview": "Oti Mabuse turns musical matchmaker as single love seekers stand on a breathtaking balcony and are serenaded by potential love matches that they can hear, but not see.Â The singers have just one song to entice a singleton down from the balcony. Only then will the two come face-to-face for the first time. The newly formed couple will then head off on a duet-date to learn, you've guessed it, a duet, before returning later in the show to perform that duet in the ultimate romantic love battle; a singing competition against the other couples to be crowned the winners",
