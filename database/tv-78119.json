  "overview": "Officer Gabriel Saint-Barthélémy isn't your average detective. Growing up in a resort on a Caribbean island, he knows both the bright and the dark side of paradise. Saint Barts is a chameleon-like inspector, very good at putting himself in his victims' shoes. And when it comes to solving cases on this paradisiacal Caribbean Island frequented by VIPs, being a Very Intrusive Policeman proves to be particularly effective.",
