  "overview": "Pro driver Shane Lynch sets two teams of mechanics a task of epic proportionsâ€¦ to build a one-off vehicle from scrapyard junk that can out-perform his top of the range supercar.During 4 manic days, the teams are expertly guided by head engineer Ralph Hosier, before they hit the racetrack aiming to topple Shane's 4 wheeled icon.
