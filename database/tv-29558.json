  "overview": "A girl is surrounded by suspicious people and quietly whispers, \"Save me!\" in a dark neighborhood alleyway, and a couple of unemployed youths hear her and run to her rescue. They discover that she's trapped in some kind of pseudo-religious cult and try to help her, but what ensues is a sequence of horrifying tension-filled events that make us wonder more about the science of the human psyche.",
