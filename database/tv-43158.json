  "overview": "Throughout her career, Hostin has dedicated herself to sharing people's stories on television, but this time is different. During the series, Hostin travels to the sites of America's most perplexing cases, interviewing detectives, prosecutors, coroners, and speaking with victims' families to piece together the emotions, evidence and, ultimately, truth of the case. As a former undefeated federal prosecutor, and current victims' rights advocate, she uses her expertise to connect with investigators and law enforcement and get to the heart of what exactly happened. With each case, Hostin proves that justice is only really achieved when you uncover the truth.",
