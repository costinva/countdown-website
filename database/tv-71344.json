  "overview": "Al Murray returns to examine a piece of British history that today is under the microscope like no other – the British Empire.  Al Murray will be taking a global history lesson to try and unpick the legacy of the empire and, importantly, how it's viewed today by the citizens of these countries.  In each country, Al will pair up with a local comedian, to explore the history of British colonial rule in that country and its legacy. In India, Al will be joined by Anuvab Pal; in Jamaica, by Chris Daley; in South Africa by Loyiso Gola; and in Australia, by Aboriginal comedian, Kevin Kropinyeri. Together, they'll find out about the origins of British rule, its impact upon each country and how its legacy continues to influence governance, culture and attitudes.    ",
