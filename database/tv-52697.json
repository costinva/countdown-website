  "overview": "No one solves a murder by themselves - it takes a skilled and dedicated team to identify, catch, and prosecute killers - and nowhere is that truer than in Atlanta, Georgia. Each Atlanta Justice episode follows investigators from Atlanta's storied Homicide Unit and skilled prosecutors from the Fulton County District Attorney's Office. Viewers will be immersed in the world of big city detectives as they solve Atlanta's most baffling and horrifying crimes and track down the city's most deadly criminals. Atlanta's Homicide Unit consistently has one of the highest clearance rates in the county, and its success is due, at least in part, to the fact that the Homicide Unit reflects the diversity of the city it serves, and that is something that will be on display in every episode of Atlanta Justice.",
