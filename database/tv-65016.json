  "overview": "Harlem is a real ghetto in one of the major Russian cities. Here, almost openly, they sell drugs and resell stolen goods. School teachers are afraid of their students, because they are able to kill for a bad grade. Local law enforcement officers do not risk appearing on its streets late at night, and residents are so accustomed to the established rules of the game that it seems that nothing can ever make them look at what is happening around them differently.",
