  "overview": "In Signed, three music moguls are on the pursuit for new artist(s) for their record labels. Over the course of the series Lenny S. (Roc Nation), Rick Ross (Maybach Music Group), and The-Dream (Radio Killa Records) will work to develop artists they believe have the potential of being a star. Unsigned hip-hop and R&amp;B artists will undergo auditions and workshops to hone their craft and determine if they really have what it takes to get signed to a deal. Throughout the series, personal workshop sessions will test the artist's ability to thrive in a producing environment and help the moguls determine if the artist really has what it takes to make it in the music industry. The workshops include authentic industry experiences such as writing 4 new songs in less than 24 hours, defining their brand, performing in front of a live audience, and working with some of the biggest names in the industry such as DJ Khaled, Meek Mill, and Bangladesh.The artists who make it to the final performance showcase will need to prove their worth to the moguls. The artists who most impress the moguls most will have an opportunity to be signed to Maybach Music, Radio Killa Records or Roc Nation.",
