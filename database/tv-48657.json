  "overview": "While convalescing down under Sir Charles Pemberton schemes to build a thermal spa in the town of Wainamu c.1900. Conflict ensues as the spa's planned location is on Māori land. The action is seen through the eyes of youngsters: hotelier's son Tom, and Pemberton's granddaughter Sarah Jane; who — along with an erupting volcano — eventually impart on Sir Charles a lesson about colonial hubris.",
