  "overview": "Each week, Outlaws veteran \"Chuck\" will serve as race master in a new city and on a new \"no prep\" track, where 32 of the biggest names in no prep racing – including Street Outlaws favorites, as well as newcomers – will duke it out to become the ultimate \"no prep winner\" and receive a $40,000 first place purse. With more than $320,000 up for grabs across eight episodes, the stakes are high and the risks are even higher, as local crowds flock to each race to see which all-star Street Outlaws will show up, and who will win it all.",
