  "overview": "The Shore franchise heads to Buckhead, Georgia to follow a group of longtime friends and former flames making a name for themselves in Atlanta's \"Beverly Hills of the South.\"Â  JuJu Barney, Katie Canham, Savannah Gabriel, Adamo Giraldo, Parker Lipman, Bethania Locke, Pat Muresan, Chelsea Prescott and DJ Simmons head to the lake for their annual summer getaway. It's time for wild fun, high drama hook-ups, and maybe even a few broken hearts.",
