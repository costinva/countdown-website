  "overview": "The Family Chase is a Saturday tea-time version of the international hit game show, The Chase.The six-episode run began on ITV in September 2017, with each show featuring a different family trying to stay one step ahead of the chaser for the opportunity to win a cash pot worth thousands. The four contestants will each answer a series of general knowledge questions as they attempt to get their tactics right and make it into the final chase, where they will then face the chaser once again for the chance to walk away with the prize.The format of the game will remain the same but the teams, which are usually made up of four strangers, will be replaced by four family members.Families will then go up against either The Beast, The Vixen, The Sinnerman, The Dark Destroyer or The Governess in a test of their general knowledge.",
