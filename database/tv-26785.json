  "overview": "In Gangs of Britain Gary and Martin Kemp take the viewer on an immersive journey across the UK in which they reveal who ran and who now runs gangland Britain. By connecting the fascinating historical stories of the country s first criminal fraternities (from Manchester's Scuttlers, and Birmingham's Brummagems to The Liverpool Cornermen) with the multi faceted gangs of today, they build up a criminal Who Do You Think You Are, full of amazing stories, characters and facts of British gangs. In each episode Gary and Martin visit a different city where they tell the connected stories of one modern day and one historical gang, through interview, archive and re-construction.",
