  "overview": "Artificial is a live, audience-interactive scripted sci-fi series following an artificial intelligence being on a journey to become human-- and she needs your help to do it!Â In Artificial: Remote Intelligence, the Twitch audience can interact directly with the characters in the show and not only transform the story, but actively participate in it through live Q&amp;A, story-driven polls, the ability to transform the musical score of the series, and even create new characters in special Worldbuilding Episodes! This is NOT a choose your own adventure story-- this is a story created collectively by you, the audience. How will you make your mark?",
