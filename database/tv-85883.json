  "overview": "13 Hours to Survive is an up-close look at the epic drama that occurs with the coming of each low tide. As the ocean recedes, sea animals become trapped in tide pools. In these miniature oceans the natural order is overturned and a struggle to survive is unleashed.The creatures have thirteen hours to survive, the time it takes for the tide to return. This underwater arena could be anywhere in the world, but this stunning series takes place near Roscoff in Brittany, France, with breathtaking windswept coasts that experience a daily tidal shift of 10 meters or more.Â ",
