  "overview": "Everything that lives moves. Even if we don't see it or don't understand how this movement occurs. However, different living organisms move in completely different, sometimes paradoxical ways. What influences the choice of a movement model? These include environmental conditions, the specifics of interaction with neighbors on the planet, the needs for nutrition and reproduction, and many other factors. The goal of the project is to show the different possibilities of movement in nature using various organs of locomotion in any natural environment.",
