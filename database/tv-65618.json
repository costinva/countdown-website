  "overview": "One could only envy Vika: she has a loving family, a career, and a handsome groom. But in an instant it all collapses. The girl gets into an accident and receives a severe spinal injury. Doctors' forecasts are sad - most likely, she will not be able to walk on her own. The groom leaves her, and the situation in the family is already difficult - the father has serious heart problems and urgent surgery is required. Against the backdrop of all these events, the girl falls into severe depression. She blames everything on the second participant in the accident, Artem, who escaped with minor injuries. And he, driven by guilt, decides to help the girl and persuades her to undergo a special rehabilitation course.",
