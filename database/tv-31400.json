  "overview": "The new series, which will premiere this autumn, sees Stafford battling extreme environments around the world - think subtropical forests, dry desserts and uninhabited mountains. Stafford has quite literally been dropped in the wilderness with a camera and no survival kit and has just 10 days to reach human civilisation. With nothing but his wit and will about him, he must rely solely on his survival instincts.",
