  "overview": "Welcome to Whitechapel: last bastion of humanity. Six years ago, the world \"ended\" in a single, apocalyptic event, trapping Great Britain behind a mysterious dome of purple energy. London's last neighborhood has persevered thanks to the protection of the \"FreakAngels\" â€” a small group of psychically-powered twenty-three-year-olds. Their fragile peace becomes threatened, however, when an exiled friend returns, exposing past conspiracies and new conflicts within their fractured, makeshift family. Can Whitechapel survive?",
