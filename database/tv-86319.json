  "overview": "Let the Devil In is a haunting and mysterious four-episode documentary series about a decades-old tragedy that destroyed one family and ignited the darkest fears of a small New Jersey town. For the first time, witnesses, friends, and community members try to make sense of the unthinkable events, some believing that Satan took hold of a vulnerable teen boy, while others believe that far more earthly demons were to blame.",
