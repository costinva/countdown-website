  "overview": "After a few years of absence, Diederik Ebbinge returns to TV with Promenade. Not from the old, familiar studio, but from his picturesque Northern French chateau, where he will receive three special regular guests for six weeks. While enjoying a good glass and delicious French food, he wants to get to know them better through good and sometimes quite emotional conversations. The regular guests are also put to the test with some very tough trials.",
