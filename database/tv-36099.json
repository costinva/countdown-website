  "overview": "Carnage sees teams of engineers, mechanics and drivers transform their wildest car concepts into a reality as they hand-build armed and battle-ready vehicles. Then, in a Mad Max-style combat in three vast arenas deep in the desert, six souped-up cars will battle it out using their bespoke weaponryâ€¦ and only one will drive away and into the season grand finale.",
