  "overview": "An absurd comedy about a couple whose perfect façade is becoming more and more cracked. Olli and Anja are a happy couple – but then Anja gets pregnant and her body releases hormones that turn her into a different person for a few weeks. A stressful person. Anja’s mood swings make Olli despair. Nine months later she goes into labour. On the way to the hospital, Anja accidentally meets Olli’s lover. And from then on, everything that can go wrong does go wrong.",
