  "overview": "Carson, Leno, Letterman - legendary hosts that changed late-night television. Through good times and bad, they gained America's trust and kept the country laughing. But it wasn't all laughter all the time. From secret deals to broken promises, some of the most dramatic stories were the ones that didn't play out in front of the television cameras.Â The Story of Late Night takes viewers on a journey back in time through the present-day of late-night television's most memorable moments. Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Chelsea Handler, Trevor Noah, Conan O'Brien, Seth Meyers, Amber Ruffin, Lorne Michaels, Desus + Mero, Whoopi Goldberg, and countless industry insiders give first-hand, behind-the-scenes accounts of an art form that changed the face of television forever.",
