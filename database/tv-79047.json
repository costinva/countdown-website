  "overview": "Twenty years ago Richard Nixon became the first US president to resign, following the Watergate scandal. Two years earlier five men, intending to bug the building, had been caught breaking into the Democratic Party head-quarters in Washington, DC. Two of those convicted were members of Nixon's re-election committee.This series, from the team who made The Second Russian Revolution, tells the story in greater detail than has been previously possible, with access to newly uncovered evidence including notes and film made by former White House chief of staff H R Haldeman.Â ",
