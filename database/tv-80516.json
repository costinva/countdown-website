  "overview": "Lady of the Dunes: Hunting a Cape Cod Killer examines the decades-long investigation of the murder of an unknown woman found in the dunes of Provincetown, Mass. Her vicious killing haunted and stymied even the most seasoned members of the town's police department, and surprisingly coincided with a man's pursuit to identify his birth mother. In 1974, the idyllic and close-knit community of Provincetown was stunned when the body of an unidentified woman was discovered in a remote area of the dunes. Over the next 50 years, investigators worked tirelessly to identify her, relentless in their pursuit of her killer and her name. The twists and turns of the Lady of the Dunes mystery tell the story of a hidden family, a suspect's violent past and a detective willing to sacrifice her career for answers. ",
