  "overview": "In the Bingo Blitz game show on Game Show Network, two contestants compete in a dynamic blend of trivia and bingo. The ultimate game of knowledge, strategy and luck, contestants answer trivia to earn bingo balls and points. In addition to numbered bingo balls, players also receive gold balls they can strategically place on their cards to increase their chances of making a bingo. Bingos earn the players bonus points, and special ‘power-ups' on the players' cards earn them extra points, bingo balls and prizes. After three rounds, the player with the highest score advances to the fast-action Blitz round, where making a bingo in 60 seconds or less awards them $10,000.",
