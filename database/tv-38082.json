  "overview": "Unlike other talent competition shows, each contestant on Can You Duet? will compete as part of a duo, working with different partners week after week as the competition progresses. As a result, viewers will witness first-hand all the on and off-stage drama to be had in creating a dynamic musical duo. In addition to critiquing each performance and deciding who will advance to the next round, be sent home, and ultimately be crowned the best new duet in America, the Judges will also serve as mentors to guide, groom and develop the duets along the way.",
