  "overview": "This landmark aerial series will focus on The Great Barrier Reef, the Outback, Western Australia, and Sydney and New South Wales. Beyond the breath-taking scenery and dramatic landscapes, the series will also focus on human activity, whether it's an indigenous dance ceremony, tourists swimming with whales or a camel road train across the desert. Shot in 4K the series will utilise a state-of-the art helicopter mounted GSS Cinema Pro Gimbal and high-end inspire drones for harder to access places.",
