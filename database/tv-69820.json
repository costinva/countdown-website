  "overview": "In their youth, investigator Ekaterina Mazurova and operative Sergei Polyakov witnessed tragic events that took place in their native village of Zamayachny, which then received the unflattering nickname Yama. In 1990, a maniac appeared there. His victims were several girls, including Valya - Katya's own sister and Sergei's fiancée. Then the murders stopped - as suddenly as they began. For a long eleven years. And all this time Sergei lived with a thirst for revenge, and Katya, in order not to go crazy, simply erased that terrible summer from her memory. But the maniac came back again. And now Katya and Sergei will have to meet again to once and for all deal with the past, which, as it turned out, never let them go.",
