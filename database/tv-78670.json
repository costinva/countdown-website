  "overview": "Across each episode, Natalie explores four talked about products -  from ice baths to teeth-whiteners. With behind-the-scenes access to scientists, nutritionists and industry insiders, Natalie will investigate how these products actually work and which ones she thinks are worth the hype. As Natalie gathers intel from a raft of experts, six charismatic British households are road-testing these products for themselves at home, then they'll give their honest opinion on which ones they'd buy.",
