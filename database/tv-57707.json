  "overview": "Kyu Han, who looks like an ordinary student, is cursed by an unfortunate curse. Every time he sneezes, things go exactly the opposite of what he hopes for, forcing him to get into all sorts of awkward situations in everyday life. However, despite his supernatural bad luck, he still prefers to romantically pursue his one-sided love, believing that if he just tried his best, he would not be able to achieve anything.Â ",
