  "overview": "Million Dollar Island presents a ground- breaking concept: 100 everyday Australians stay on a remote island, vying for a chance to win $1 million, the biggest prize money on Australian TV. But braving the harsh conditions with limited means isn't the only challenge on an island full of mystery, surprise, hardships and rewards.Each contestant starts the adventure with a wristband worth $10,000. While they are on the island, contestants can gain and lose wristbands by competing in various challenges. They can also receive wristbands from other contestants. When someone gives up and decides to leave the island, they must give their wristband(s) to a contestant who stays behind.Alliances mean everything. Friendships are worth a fortune. Some contestants will become richer by winning challenges and inheriting wristbands, while those who lose and fail to collect new wristbands must eventually go home. In the end, a nail-biting final challenge helps determine who walks away with a life-changing prize.Hosted by Ant Middleton, Million Dollar Island is a revolutionary social experiment where the rules of society don't exist. In the ultimate game of human behaviour, will chaos or order prevail, and will friendships lead to fortunes?",
