  "overview": "For as long as Hank has hosted Crash Course, he's wanted to host a series about the history of science. We've been asking big questions for a really long time and we've all wanted to explore how we've sought to answer those questions through the centuries. Questions like, \"What is stuff?\" and \"Where are we?\" have inspired people all over the world to investigate. So lets dive in and see how we, as a people, have tried to figure this stuff out.",
