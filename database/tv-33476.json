Then, five very busy years later, she landed a dream job at Essence magazine, the leading publication for African American women. Monique quickly rose to become editor-in-chief—even as she continued to run the B&amp;B. Much to everyone's shock, Monique eventually decided to walk away from her high-profile job at Essence. After juggling two professions for years, she wanted to focus on building the B&amp;B business with her husband, Glenn, with the goal of creating a legacy they could pass on to their daughter, Glynn.Today, Akwaaba Bed &amp; Breakfast Inns is the most successful B&amp;B business on the east coast and Monique remains the hands-on force behind it.
