  "overview": "The series is adapted from the novel of the same name by Cang Yue. The story follows the unrestrained swordsman Huo Zhanba, who seeks medicine for a friend's child and encounters the pharmacist Xue Ziyue. Over eight years of daily interaction, they progress from having their own convictions to deepening understanding, mutual redemption, and a promise to meet under a plum tree the following year. However, due to the responsibilities they bear, they find it difficult to express their love, leaving behind a regret of eternal separation. Amidst the joyous toasts in the snowy night and a farewell across a thousand miles, a poignant and unforgettable missed opportunity unfolds—a love destined to be unable to endure, depicting a tale of redemption and letting go in a life-and-death romance. ",
