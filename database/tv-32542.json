  "overview": "When we tamper with nature, it often fights back. Or if we move into the territory of big predators, they don't just sit and watch. These are the stories of mankind's battles with nature-- when we upset the balance and when carnivores decide they don't want us hanging around. Someone is going to lose the fight and it's often us.",
