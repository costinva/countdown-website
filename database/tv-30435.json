  "overview": "Deep in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, where Jane Goodall began her pioneering work, epic and startling dramas worthy of Shakespeare are lived out by chimpanzees and gorillas. In a kingdom where \"royal\" families rule with tolerance and battle fiercely, seethe with resentment and love tenderly, power players endlessly jockey for position in the quest for the throne.",
