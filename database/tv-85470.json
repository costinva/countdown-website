  "overview": "Kristoffer Appelquist has invited five of Sweden's funniest comedians to his luxury villa in Cyprus. During the daytime, they soak up the sun and enjoy the pool, but in the evening, things heat up as the guests, one after another, must take their place in the hot seat and get roasted by their friends. The last of them is the host, only to decide then who has become the best roaster of the season.",
