  "overview": "Real Estate expert Scott McGillivray has purchased his next big property: A scenic lakeside vacation resort. There's only one issue – it's an absolute wreck! Now on a mission to resurrect the property, he's enlisting the help of his friendly rival, who knows a thing or two about resorts — Bryan Baeumler! But they're not getting their hands dirty this time. They've scoured North America to find four contractor and designer duos who will do battle over 7 weeks to create gorgeous, one-of-a-kind, waterfront cabins. Judged by Scott, Bryan and special guests along the way, the winning team with the best vacation rental cabin will take home the title of Renovation Resort Champion and a life-changing reward of $100,000!",
