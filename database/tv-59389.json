  "overview": "Alex Guarnaschelli is one of the most accomplished and revered chefs in the culinary arena, having won virtually every battle she has ever competed in. Now, over the course of five weeks, 15 brave chefs from across the United States take their best shot at beating Alex for the ultimate culinary triumph in the new competition series, Alex vs America. Hosted by the acclaimed chef Eric Adjepong, each episode features three culinary superstars competing over two rounds against one another as well as against Alex. These competitors might hail from different states, but they all share the same mastery of a specific ingredient or dish, one that they have spent endless hours in their own kitchens perfecting and which will now be tested in an effort to take down one of the country's most formidable chefs.At the start of each battle, Alex and the competitors learn what the challenge will be, with the chefs having the ability to work together in selecting variables for their dishes as well as the amount of time they give themselves and Alex to cook with. Each finished plate will undergo a blind tasting, with only the top three chefs advancing and the least successful from the challenge being immediately sent home, even if it is Alex. In the end, it all comes down to what's on the plate. Will the final two chefs outcook and outshine Alex, earning bragging rights over an award-winning Iron Chef? Or will Alex's legendary winning streak continue, sending all the ambitious competitors home with nothing but their disappointment? ",
