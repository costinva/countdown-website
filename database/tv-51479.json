  "overview": "This series is about a young teenage boy named, Tommy Cadle who loves to hang out with his Pet Alien pals. It's a great series. Watch it! Imagine that you're an alien from outer space. You've left behind your boring, conformist dimension known as Conforma and traveled across time, space and other dimensions to arrive at planet earth, and then land in a little out-of-the-way seaside town called DeSpray Bay. More specifically, Tommy Cadle's lighthouse hideaway. That's right! Pet Aliens have crashed into the top of the lighthouse tower and made themselves at home. Unfortunately, the earth boy living there was none-too-keen on this house invasion. When Tommy woke to be greeted by a big, slobbering Gumpers, he did what any kid would do when faced with being devoured by a pink, fuzzy, lovable alien: he ran and fell off the top of his lighthouse!",
