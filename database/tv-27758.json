  "overview": "Drive around any corner in the U.S., and there's likely a fast-food joint serving one-of-a-kind eats. The establishments represent a classic slice of Americana, the experience of enjoying quick, tasty, inexpensive fare. This series digs into the nostalgia and pop culture associated with this fascinating world, revealing behind-the-scenes stories and obscure facts about such iconic chains as Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, as well as revisiting memorable ad campaigns, and making stops at original outposts of popular brands such as Dunkin' Donuts and Nathan's Famous. Plus, up-and-coming chains and hidden gems like Jet Bar-B-Q are spotlighted. Radio personality Jon Hein, whose claim to fame is coining the phrase \"jump the shark\", is the host.",
