  "overview": "For a lonely orphan, there is almost only one career path to success. That is to get a national qualification as an alchemist. After graduating from the Royal Alchemist Training Academy, which requires nothing but ability, Sarasa is presented with the rights to a store by her master. After being sent off by her generous mentor, Sarasa sets off on her journey, dreaming of a slightly elegant life as an alchemist, but upon arrival, she is shocked to find that the countryside is even more rural than she had imagined. However, even in such a place, she has to manage a store somehow to make a living.",
