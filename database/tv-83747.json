  "overview": "Pinkalicious &amp; Peterrific follows the adventures of Pinkalicious and her brother Peter. Pinkalicious imagines creative possibilities everywhere she looks. She is an artist at heart—and, like most creative people, she sees the world differently from others. She knows what she likes, and she's not afraid to express herself—though she sometimes needs help from her brother, Peter, and her neighborhood friends.",
