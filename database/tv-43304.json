  "overview": "In february 1916, the German army attacked the French positions near the city Verdun. The result: the longest battle of World War I and one of the most bloodiest one to ever take place. A battle that took more than 300 days was a true battle of exhaustion and resulted in the death of more than 700.000 men. The terrible, a real apocalyptic, battle that took place on a battle ground of approximately 100 square kilometer and neither parties did achieve anything with it. The Battle of Verdun has gone down in history as a completely useless mass slaughter that should never be forgotten. This moving documentary will therefore be of indispensable value. With coloured archived material, we will reveal the destruction of the battle in a unique way and reveal the bewildering course of the battle.",
