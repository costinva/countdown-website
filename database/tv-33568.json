  "overview": "You don't mess with \"Hardingar\"! Buddies Joar &amp; Lothepus have grown up in SÃ¸rfjorden in Hardanger, also known as \"the fjord God forgot\". Now they work together in the construction industry where everyday life consists of excavators, drills and dynamite, diesel, steel and sweat. They work hard to live even harder. They juggle family life with pirate life and leave nothing, absolutely nothing, to stop them from realizing their dreams.",
