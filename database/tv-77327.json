  "overview": "The Last Anniversary is set on Scribbly Gum Island, a place of many secrets. The one that made it famous – the disappearance of a young couple decades ago – might have made the island a destination for true crime tourists but when it comes to secrets, the three generations of women that call Scribbly Gum home hold far more.When Sophie Honeywell inherits a house on the island, left only to her by her ex-boyfriend's great-aunt Connie, it's the fresh start she's craving, despite the unwelcome reception she receives on arrival. Single and approaching 40, Sophie is intrigued by something else Connie left her – a promise that she might finally find the man of her dreams on Scribbly Gum Island. But perhaps what Sophie needs is an island full of women instead?",
