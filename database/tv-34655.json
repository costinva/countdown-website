  "overview": " October 12, the TV channel \"Belarus 1\" presents the premiere of the intellectual game \"Trust and verify,\" in which each player can earn 5 million rubles with the help of his intuition. The game can rightly be called a national game, as to participate in it you do not need to fill out a questionnaire or undergo a special selection - any passer-by from the street can become its participant. The uniqueness of the game lies in the fact that it does not take place in a television studio, but in the streets of Minsk, in the major shopping centers of the city. The player is selected at random from random passers-by. He is invited to find answers to a number of questions. With a satisfactory answer to each of them, he will earn a certain amount of money. The distinctive feature of the game \"Trust and verify\" is that the player should not answer the questions himself. From the crowd of passers-by, he must choose a person who will answer the question and help him win money. The player has only one clue - \"Call a friend\". Within 20 seconds a participant can consult a friend on the phone. The creators of the project hope that due to their nationality, accessibility and mobility, a gambling show with a monetary prize will become the most popular intellectual game in Belarusian television. The host of the program is Artem Rybakin.",
