  "overview": "Somebodies tells the story of Scottie, an everyday, party-hopping, church-going, African-American undergraduate student looking for a good time with his friends and a little luck with the ladies. Unfortunately for Scottie, his path to peace of mind is fraught with a fire-and-brimstone preacher (Reverend Hill), fun-loving friends and fellow students (Tory, Jelly, Marlo, and Six), an eccentric southern family (Aunt Agnes, Uncle Skeeter and Uncle Charles) and a sexy young woman (Diva) who, like everyone else in his life, may have a screw or two loose. Tune in weekly for this unconventional, smart and honest comedy about a laidback college student trying to make sense of the world and the offbeat friends and family, around him. Each episode will be complete in and of itself. Major characters – Scottie, the guys, Diva, and Reverend Hill – will appear in each episode, and these characters will continue to develop in unexpected ways, growing more layered with each episode.",
