  "overview": "In Sygeplejersken we are taken behind the walls of a hospital in the outskirts of Denmark, where everyone knows each other and where there's little change in personnel. We follow Pernille Kurzmann in her first days in her new job as a nurse. She soon befriends the very charming and charismatic nurse Christina Aistrup Hansen who at first seems to be one of a kind, loved by everyone, incredible at her job and always first on the spot in an emergency. However, as the days go by and Pernille gets to know her way around she slowly starts seeing that there might be more to Christina than what first meets the eye. She decides that she cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening in front of her and she journeys out to uncover the truth.",
