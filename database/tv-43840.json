  "overview": "Sam, with only a very basic grasp of the featured language, comes to stay with his pen pal, Lola. Living with Lola is roommate Ana. Sleazy and sly neighbor Pablo lives across the hallway. Hector's/Sam's efforts to get to grips with the language provide the dynamic for the series' language learning content. The series is particularly suitable for adolescents and young adults who can relate to the contextual setting and implied meanings in the screenplay.",
