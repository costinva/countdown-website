  "overview": "As Poncet, de Lestrade and director Remy Burkel scrutinize four recent murder cases, their cameras sit in on strategy sessions in the offices of the district attorney, observe moving conversations between the accused and their public defenders, and chronicle the trial as it unfolds in the courtroom. Like their other acclaimed films, Poncet and de Lestrade's raw, honest and suspenseful stories are as emotionally engaging as any high-quality TV drama, while also opening a window to the realities of crime and punishment in the United States.",
