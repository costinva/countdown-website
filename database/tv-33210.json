  "overview": "What is the statute of limitations on revenge? For Blythe Hunter there isn't one. Twenty-five years haven't put a dent in the pain and humiliation of being abandoned by Theodore Crawford, who married another woman for prestige and money. Now Blythe is back in Theodore's life, hell bent on taking away every piece of his beautiful existence, starting with The Tides racetrack. She's not afraid to use her twin sons Josh and Aaron to help her destroy the Crawford family, and to get to Theodore through his daughters Emma and Brooke. Things don't always go according to plan, especially when the wrong son falls in love with Emma, but Blythe is tireless in her quest for revenge. Will the young lovers change the path of these two families? Will Blythe's manipulations destroy not only Theodore, but her own two sons? Can true love put an end to the deceit, or will revenge win out?",
