  "overview": "In Russia, hundreds of thousands of families are separated by long distances: people move to big cities to build a career and seek personal happiness in different parts of our country. So it happened with the Tkachevs: the main character Natasha went to Moscow with the dream of becoming an architect, her parents stayed in Yekaterinburg and separated, and her sister Nadia married Dima, gave birth to a child and moved to the small town of Irbit in the Sverdlovsk region.  Natasha feels guilty for abandoning her family, and constantly tries to solve their problems via video link. At the same time, he tries to cope with difficulties at work and hides that he lives with an older man and thinks whether it is worth connecting life with him.",
