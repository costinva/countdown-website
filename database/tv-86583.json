  "overview": "On April 15, 2009, several police forces joined forces to conduct the largest raid against a criminal biker group. The result of Operation SharQc was the arrest of 156 Hells supporters, including 111 members in good standing, almost all of the Quebec members. THE EVIDENCE: Operation SharQc is a documentary series that recounts the construction and collapse of the largest evidence ever amassed against criminal bikers in the world. A criminal and legal saga told to us by those who lived it, on both sides of the story: police officers, prosecutors, and the accused.",
