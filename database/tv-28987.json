  "overview": "Kyō Mekui is a high school student who tends to skip school due to a trauma in his past. Kyō secretly creates songs using vocal song synthesis software as his hobby. Three girls who just entered fifth grade — the crybaby Jun \"Jun-tan\" Gotō, the strong-willed Nozomi \"Zomi\" Momijidani, and the somewhat sleepy Sora \"Kū\" Kaneshiro who takes life at her own pace — email Kyō. These three girls, who were raised together like sisters since childhood, want Kyō to help them break into music.",
