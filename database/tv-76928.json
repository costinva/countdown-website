  "overview": "Alone with his camera, photojournalist Christoffer Hjalmarsson lives 30 days together with the inmates in a Swedish prison. By living inside the walls himself and as far as possible sharing the daily life of the inmates, Christoffer wants to try to understand how a prison works and how a prison sentence affects the person sitting there. Both through what the inmates themselves tell and through Christoffer's own experiences.",
