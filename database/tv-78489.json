  "overview": "Everything happens in a weekend, in a provincial hotel, near a river. A family threatened by the hotel's bankruptcy and torn apart by jealousy and heartbreaks, but above all by the inability of loving and being a mother. Three groups of guests install themselves there in that weekend, looking for solutions to solve their crises. In this hotel's closed space, near the water, loves and heartbreaks, frustrating lives and harmful passions are revealed.",
