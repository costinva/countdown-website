  "overview": "Do or Die drops a group of unsuspecting workers into some of the harshest Australian environments for five grueling days. Calling on the help of workplace psychologist and outdoor adventurer, Dr Travis Kemp, the group is sent on what they believe to be a fun team-building exercise. Instead, they'll be flung into a survival adventure with no escape.",
