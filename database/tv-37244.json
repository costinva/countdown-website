  "overview": "Two years ago, five high-school boys brought fame to a small town in Japan. What was so unique was that they formed a \"men's synchronized swimming club.\" Their involvement and struggles while learning synchronized swimming - known to be a sport for girls - brought much attention to their school and town. Two years have passed since that summer, and the boys of Tadano High School are still in the club.",
