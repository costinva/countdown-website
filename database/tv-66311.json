  "overview": "Mrs. Sidhu is a high-end caterer with a taste for crime. Recently widowed, she juggles her new catering business with encouraging her wayward son Tez to find his passion, all while serving up justice to those who believe they are above the law. Her forays into sleuthing see her form an unofficial partnership with long-suffering divorcee DCI Burton who reluctantly accepts that together they're an unbeatable crime-fighting duo, much to the bemusement of his partner, DS Mint.Â ",
