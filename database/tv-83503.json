  "overview": "Priest and presenter Zbigniew Czendlik, known as Zibi, gets behind the wheel of a caravan and sets off on a journey across a vast country, in whose voivodeships you can find unique monuments, natural attractions, centuries-old traditions and excellent gastronomy. He is interested in the history hidden in the cities, as well as the natural beauty that gives an idea of the diversity of the Polish landscape, which stretches from our borders to the Baltic Sea. These riches, together with the friendliness of the local people, are the reason why Zibi embarks on a journey through his native land with enthusiasm and anticipation.",
