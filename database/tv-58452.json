  "overview": "Michael is joined by his culinary director and right-hand, Katie Pickens, as they challenge the best of the best in the culinary world, with Michael taking on that chef's signature dish and challenging them to a good old-fashioned Throwdown. The catch – Michael doesn't know who he is going up against and the chefs don't know Michael is coming. Through four episodes, Michael will cook alongside the opposition, bringing his competitive spirit and creativity to the dishes that he is challenged to make while a crowd of spectators watch on. Each Throwdown has three total points at stake, with a pair of special guest judges blind tasting the dishes along with the audience in attendance, to determine the winner and see who has the ultimate Throwdown bragging rights.",
