  "overview": "Filip Hammar has a good life, but constantly thinks if could be even better if he lived somewhere else or worked as something else entirely. Now with his friend Fredrik Wikingsson they set out to live their dreams. Maybe he will calm down and realize that he has it pretty well where he is, or he will discover something even better? In La Bamba med Filip och Fredrik, Fredrik and Philip live out their dreams. For example, to be a pastor in Memphis, to live spiritually with monks in a silent retreat, to play with a basketball team, to try to be loved by young people in the problem area of Compton, to be dominated by a dominatrix or to live like a cowboy in Arizona.",
