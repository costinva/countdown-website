  "overview": "Joe, a 90-year-old widower, is living alone when his misguided adult grandson moves in with nothing but a backpack, a box of condoms and a sense of entitlement. Ethan is 31, single and jobless. Joe disapproves of his grandson's instability and seemingly singular ambition: getting laid. Ethan is concerned that his grandfather has become increasingly detached from the world since his wife passed away. They're both in ruts and a new living situation might just be what's needed to reverse their fortunes. From Tinder dates to early bird specials, this odd pair discovers they have a lot to learn from each other.",
