  "overview": "Set against 40 years of music history, Hip Hop Uncovered takes a deep dive into the paradox of America's criminalization of the genre and its fascination with the street culture that created it and still exists within it. Instead of telling the story of hip hop from the top down, The series tells the story from the streets up, as it reveals the untold story of how America's streets helped shape hip hop culture from an expression of survival and defiance into music's most dominant genre.",
