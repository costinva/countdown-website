  "overview": "For these women, stripping isn't just a way to make ends meet; it's a profession, an art form and a cornerstone of the Vegas economy. Taking us on a journey to Las Vegas, Strip will follow a main cast of twelve women onstage, backstage and outside the club, all determined to be the best in the business. Crazy Horse III Gentlemen's Club is the hottest strip club in the world, where those at the top can make six figures in a single night. It's a world of fierce competition, eye-popping outfits and mind-blowing dancing, but with 20,000 strippers working in Las Vegas, it's a war out there. They have got to earn their place and learn the rules of the strip club if they want to survive.",
