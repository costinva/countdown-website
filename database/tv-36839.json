  "overview": " After a serious injury, former Major Arkady Melnik serves as a \"seniority\" before retirement in the FSIN escort troops as the head of the exit guard. In one of the shifts he accompanies a party of especially dangerous criminals in a special train car. Stopping at one of the stations, Melnik on duty is excommunication. At this time an unknown enters the car and, neutralizing the convoy, releases 16 convicts. The FSIN leadership asks Miller to lead the group to catch the escaped criminals, arguing that the investigation should not be publicized in the press, as it can cause panic among the population. Each series is devoted to the capture of one of the criminals and brings the viewer closer to the key to the mystery: who is the corrupt official and traitor from the special services' leadership?",
