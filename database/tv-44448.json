  "overview": "Stille Waters was a Flemish drama series commissioned by VRT-TV1. This 2001 co-production between TV1 (now: one; first network of the Flemish public broadcaster) and Fonds Film in Vlaanderen (now: VAF; Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds) pushes the boundaries of television fiction by spreading a long haunting story over 13 episodes. The heroic battle between a powerful industrialist (Alex Vorlat) and a young woman (Jana Meyer) who goes in search of the cause of her father's death creates haunting drama along the banks of the Scheldt in the region of Klein-Brabant.",
