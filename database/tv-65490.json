  "overview": "After a number of liberal reforms of Alexander II, including the judicial one, a group of lawyers began to stand out among lawyers in St. Petersburg and Moscow, many of whom were real stars, and high-profile trials with their participation began to attract hundreds of spectators, competing with theatrical performances. Fyodor Plevako was one of the brightest heroes of that time. In addition to his outstanding oratorical talent and natural wit, he possessed another important feature that distinguished him from other lawyers – he was from the people. Being illegitimate himself, Plevako perfectly understood ordinary people and really wanted to help them, which made him a national favorite.",
