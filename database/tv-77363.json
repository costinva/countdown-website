  "overview": "This film tells the story of Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, best known as Leonardo da Vinci, a fifteenth-century Italian polymath of soaring imagination and profound intellect, who left behind artistic works of staggering beauty and detailed sketches of futuristic contraptions of warfare and flight marveled at today for their technical ingenuity and foresight.From his birth out of wedlock to a notary and peasant woman and apprenticeship to a distinguished Florentine painter to his days as a military architect, cartographer, sculptor, and muralist for hire, the film offers an intimate portrait of a singular visionary whose Mona Lisa, The Last Supper and The Vitruvian Man are among the most celebrated works known to man, but whose artistic endeavors sometimes seemed an afterthought to his pursuits in science and engineering.Set against a rich and dynamic backdrop of Renaissance Italy, at a time of skepticism and free-thinking, regional war, and religious upheaval, Leonardo da Vinci brings Leonardo and his towering achievements to life through his voluminous personal notebooks, primary and secondary accounts of his life and times, and on-camera interviews with modern scholars, artists, engineers, inventors, and admirers.Directed and produced by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, and David McMahon, written by David McMahon and Sarah Burns, and executive produced by Ken Burns, Leonardo da Vinci will broadcast November 18-19, 2024, on PBS (4 hours).",
