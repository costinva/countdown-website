  "overview": "1939 Major of State Security Shuvalov invites Anna, a young capable student of the Faculty of Philology, to become an employee of a special department. Anna, who sees herself as a philologist, but not a scout, categorically refuses, but after she is expelled from the university on a false denunciation, she nevertheless accepts Shuvalov's offer. Performing one of the tasks, Anna accidentally meets the German submariner Walter von Rieden. Young people are imbued with each other with a mutual feeling that will eventually turn their whole life upside down",
