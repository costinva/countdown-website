  "overview": "The series follows the fortunes of the Tucker family, a close-knit, extended family of ‘loveable rogues' who earn their living in a number of ways - many of which are on ‘the wrong side of the law'. Glyn Tucker lives with his mother Peggy and his two sons Billy and Bobby Tucker. The multigenerational family are constantly looking for ways to bring in more money via their ‘legitimate' catering business whether it's selling wine or furniture removal. Money is tight, their tempers are short and a brush with the local constabulary is never too far away.",
