  "overview": "Take a group of 14 young volunteers aged 18 to 24, place them into the NHS, and see if they can make a real difference to both patients and staff alikeâ€¦This four-part documentary series - inspired by a social care programme in Germany - follows 14 young people as they're put to work on the wards at the Royal Derby Hospital.It could be a life-changing experience for the young volunteers, who will be thrown in at the deep end, looking after patients and assisting staff as they go about treating patients in the maternity wards, A&amp;E, paediatrics, elderly care and everything in between.But the volunteers won't be parachuted into the wards completely unaware. Before they are allowed near the patients, it's the job of Clinical Educator Andy to train them- and as he observes: \"It's a big job, I'm very nervous. They could kill somebody.\"Senior nurses and sisters guide the volunteers through the intricacies of hospital life as they face the most gruelling weeks of their lives. Could it be that these young people can help lighten the load of our NHS staff? How will they cope with the blood, sweat and tears of hospital life? And will the brave leap of faith made by hospital bosses prove to be a success?",
