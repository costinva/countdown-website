  "overview": "Welcome to the school where your fears and nightmares become a hilariously creepy reality! Ghouls in the classroom! Elsa, Josh and the other kids have personal dilemmas and everyday problems just like the rest of us. But in the twilight zone of Creepschool nothing stays everyday for very long. Prepare for goose-bumps and laughter as the kids and their creep friends go off on adventures that make your school look like...well, kindergarten.",
