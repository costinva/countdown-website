  "overview": "Some say that a house is not a home without a dog - but what about 21 rescue dogs, 2 donkeys, some pigs, an alpaca, a goat... and a very awkward llama? For Lee Asher, it's not only another day in paradise, but it's a chance to take on the animals who are underdogs just like him and to show them the love, confidence, and stability they need to thrive in his Oregon-based sanctuary, The Asher House. Join Lee and his extended furry-family as he goes above and beyond to create a modern-day Noah's Ark through his sanctuary not only to provide a space for these animals, but to build a home and the best life imaginable for every animal in need.",
