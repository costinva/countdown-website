  "overview": "A story that will destroy the audience's ideas about the life of actors and let the audience into their real life with their fears, desires and goals. It will become clear how those who are used to being thought of as carefree people actually live. And just like in the acting profession - how little in any other - the one who yesterday was everything, tomorrow can become nobody. ",
