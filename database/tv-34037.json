  "overview": "Based on international lists of reliable bodies such as WHO, UN and yes, even FIFA, Kobe goes to the best and the worst student in the class. No interviews with ministers or other senior officials, but with ordinary people. Like a family in Hong Kong that lives with five family members in a small studio. Or an employee of a Japanese company who is obliged to diet from his boss. And how desperate you are in Benin by the humanities if your school does not even have running water or toilet? How do you end up in prison in Iceland, the safest country in the world? And how do you survive the hell of IS in Iraq without eating and drinking for your baby?",
