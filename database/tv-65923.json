  "overview": "In the village of Varmalei, former classmates gather for the twentieth anniversary of graduation. A glorious anniversary is overshadowed by a car caught from the pond, which has lain at the bottom since the commemorative graduation. Inside - a corpse and an unusual stone, which turns out to be a meteorite. The investigation, as if into a funnel, draws in all those who gathered to celebrate: it exacerbates old conflicts, confuses the already complicated relations between former classmates and their teachers. Everyone learns something shocking about themselves and others: who they were in the 90s, who they have become and what they are capable of in the present.",
