  "overview": "Optimistic young Lloyd would like nothing more than to achieve his life's dream of becoming a soldier in the capital. Unfortunately, his neighbors and friends consider him the weakest boy in the village and are sure Lloyd will meet his doom the minute he sets out on his foolhardy journey. But no one realizes that by living near the most dangerous dungeon in the land, what the locals consider to be everyday annoyances would be apocalyptic for anybody else! And when Lloyd defies the townspeople and makes off for a starter town for adventurers, the rest of the kingdom is about to find out just how overpowered Lloyd really is!",
