  "overview": "The backdrop of Gilgamesh is the fight between two opposing forces. One of the forces is known as the Gilgamesh, lead by Terumichi Madoka (better known as Enkidu), and the other side is the Countess of Werdenberg and the three Orga-Superior children who live with her. In appearance, the Orga-Superior are indistinguishable from humans. However, they carry a special power known as \"Dynamis\" which allows them to use psychic energy and control objects using only their mind. The overarching theme of Gilgamesh is one of choosing sides.",
