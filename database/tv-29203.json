  "overview": "Greater Yellowstone is a unique place. Nestling high up in the Rocky Mountains in North West America, this ecosystem is one of the world's greatest wildernesses. But it's a place of extremes, and the wildlife must deal with one of the toughest springs on Earth. To understand how, this series is following a number of iconic wildlife families â€“ including wolves, grizzlies, Great Gray Owls and beavers. Using the latest filming technology, the team of scientists and cameramen track the animals and analyse what's going on. Host Kirk Johnson, the Sant Director of the National Museum of Natural History, heads the team and also gets to grips with the science behind what makes Yellowstone tick in the Great Yellowstone Thaw.",
