  "overview": "In each episode of Recipe for Disaster, three professional chefs and their cooking partners compete to prepare spectacular dishes under absurdly adverse conditions. The studio transforms into a bizarre new world each week, replete with themed disasters that challenge the chefs in ways they never imagined. They will attempt the perfect sear while stranded on an in-studio \"desert island\" during monsoon season, prep ramen while pulling off an art heist, or create a show-stopping souffl√© while dodging aliens on Mars. To make matters worse, their cooking partners are people from their lives who are total kitchen novices. Who will impress the judges, and whose dishes will succumb to the ridiculous disasters du jour? Ultimately, only one team will be crowned Masters of Disaster!",
