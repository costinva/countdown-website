  "overview": "Welcome to ancient Baghdad, and the home of the Wazir, his two \ndaughters, and servant, Ali Oopla. At his master's every beck and call, \nAli regularly finds himself running around in hairy entanglements with \nthose far richer than his master, from merchant traders to the Caliph, \nand even some of the richest men in the world. More often than not, \nthose entanglements involve the Wazir's daughters: the na√Øve but sweet \nSaccharine; and Boobiana and her two beauties. If Ali's not careful, he \ncould find himself on a slow roast!",
