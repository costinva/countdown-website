The envoy and the Roc engage each other in a duel. Fast-forward five hundred years and an injured man is lying in the wilderness. Luk Ching-yee, female embroiderer in a small village, comes to his rescue. He becomes a laborer at the embroidery workshop and dyehouse.

He is also reunited with his old buddy Fong Chi-peng. Sau-yuen and female constable So Yau become adversaries. During repeated confrontations, the duo covertly begin to have affectionate feelings for each other. However, Ching-yee also makes advances to Sau-yuen. Black demon crisis then hits the small village. To save the mortals, Sau-yuen decides to forget love and desire. Everything is actually karma. Fate is predestined.",
