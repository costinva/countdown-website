  "overview": "At Cheng Yan's advancement ceremony, her martial brother Cheng Tian forced her into dual cultivation. In despair, Cheng Yan self-destructed her inner core but was saved by her contracted magical beast, Chen. She later discovered that Cheng Tian's body had been taken over by the ancient magical beast, Sha. Determined to avenge herself, she began her quest for revenge. Cheng Yan refined an ancient artifact to restore her inner core but was poisoned in the process, leaving her with little time to live. She chose to marry Chen but sent him back to the demon realm the day after their wedding and was killed shortly after. Enraged, Chen returned to Longqiu only to find that Cheng Yan had been reborn as Lu Ming, an immortal. Using Lu Ming's identity, Cheng Yan attempted to reseal Sha but was exposed. She and Chen ultimately joined forces in a final battle, sealing Sha for good and restoring peace to the three realms.",
