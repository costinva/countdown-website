  "overview": "Due to his lack of drive, Shirou has failed the university entrance exams three times and just can't seem to do anything right. When Shirou starts to contemplate why somebody like him is living at all, a mysterious man named Tendou appears, calling himself an \"angel\". Tendou warns Shirou that his death is just around the corner if he does not push himself harder. Shirou takes the initiative and ends up saving someone else from an untimely death. In this way, Shirou avoids one brush with death after another by listening to Tendou's frustrating riddles and gradually learns the value of life. With a lot of laughter and a few tears, Shirou's trial teaches the importance of being confident and hard work",
