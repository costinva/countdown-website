  "overview": "Simple and incorruptible policeman Serhii Bondar is transferred, as a punishment, to a new position — a district precinct officer. Bondar sincerely hopes that soon he will be reinstated in the service at the Central Office, but for now, he just needs to endure only two months in such a gloomy place, which for an operative who is used to formidable bandits and serious crimes, seems like a real hell.",
