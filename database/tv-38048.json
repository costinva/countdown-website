  "overview": "Ian Struan Dunross is chairman of Struan &amp; Co, the oldest and largest of the British-East Asia trading companies. To the Chinese, that also makes him \"Tai-Pan\" (\"supreme leader\") of the \"Noble House\". Unfortunately, with his power, he inherits ancient promises, dark secrets and deep financial problems on a small island full of people who want to see Struan's fall so they can become the Noble House. Dunross' worst enemy is the vicious Quillan Gornt, a lesser tai-pan, and he's doing everything in his power to bring the Noble House to ruin. Drawn into the fight between Gornt and Dunross is an upstart American billionaire who tries to gain a foothold on the Hong Kong market and has made a deal to steal something that will give him power, even over the Noble House. Unfortunately, that something has fallen into the hands of a powerful Chinese overlord. \"Everybody was watching [and cheating on] everybody.\" Who will succeed in the end?",
