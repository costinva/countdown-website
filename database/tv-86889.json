  "overview": "In a new six-part series, Hanoch Daum will try to break the boundaries of political correctness and laugh at things that shouldn't be laughed at. In each episode, Hanoch went on a pastoral vacation outside the city with four people who all have a common denominator - some kind of disability or belonging to a group that the conversation about, and certainly the jokes about, are taboo. During the vacation he will have in-depth conversations with them and hear from their side what their lives are like. At the end of the vacation, he will perform a stand-up show, with the four participants with whom he spent time sitting in the front row.",
