  "overview": "The story of a family and a tradition that remain the same despite the time going by, in a land that has existed for centuries. In La Camarga, one of the last natural sanctuaries that still exist, the Az√©racs, landowners and aristocrats, work as wild bulls breeders. Shaken by passion and revenge, the family will have to face the adversities of a fate marked by the events that define the 20th century. In spite of this, the family will struggle to survive in an environment strongly bound to traditions and land.",
