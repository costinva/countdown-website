  "overview": "Over the next four days and three nights, in a secluded area, players must uncover each other's secret identities. They play on either team - the Mafia or the Citizens. A select few with life experience play for the Mafia, while the majority represent the Citizens. Through a series of intense missions, players must determine who is who, relying on mere intuition. The player with the sharpest intuition who can deduce everyone's true self wins the prize money.",
