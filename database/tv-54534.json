  "overview": "23-year-old Lennart Johansson from Fellingsbro is dark-skinned and wants to become a dance band star, and has Christer Sjögren as his idol. He wants to sing with the dance band Sven Bodins, but does not get in because of his skin color. Sven Bodins claims that there are too many racial prejudices in the dance band genre, but claims that he does not mind dark-skinned dance band singers. Lennart Johansson then decides to start his own dance band.",
