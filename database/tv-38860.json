  "overview": "What the Killer Did Next, fronted by Philip Glenister, is a new crime format which begins with a murder. Each episode seeks to find the killer's motive and discover what kind of person could commit this crime: not by looking at what happened before the murder but by studying the killer's behaviour after the heinous event.",
