  "overview": "Märchenperlen is ZDF's series of fairy tale adaptations, which has existed since 2005. These are often fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm, which are mainly broadcast in the Christmas program. The films are based on the classic traditions, but have been modernized in terms of narrative and content (e.g. Little Red Riding Hood). Outdated statements and symbolism from the original version were reinterpreted or supplemented in order to take contemporary linguistic sensitivity into account.",
