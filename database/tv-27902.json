  "overview": "WWF Mania  was a professional wrestling television program produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It aired on Saturday mornings on the USA Network between 1993 and 1996 and summarized the weekly events in WWF programming. In its earlier years, Mania usually featured a show exclusive wrestling match. For roughly the first year of its run, Mania also took viewer calls live and only viewers in the Eastern and Central time zones could participate in that portion of the show. Mania was originally hosted by Todd Pettengill, who was later joined by \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage from 1993 to 1994. From December 1994 to July 1995 he was joined by Stephanie Wiand. For feature matches (matches exclusive to Mania), Sean Mooney and Lord Alfred Hayes were the broadcasters, until Mooney left in the Spring of 1993, which led to Hayes being phased out from the broadcast booth. From then on Mania used various other broadcasters including Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon. The 1994 Slammy Awards took place on an episode of WWF Mania.",
