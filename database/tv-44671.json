  "overview": "Atle Antonsen takes on the role as the almighty king, with Olli Wermskog as his right hand assistant. In each program he gives absurd and practical assignments and challenges to five comedians, which they will have to solve in the most creative and effective way possible. Dirty tricks and bribes are allowed, and when all is said and done - and all dignity is gone - it's up to Atle Antonsen to decide who is this week's winner.",
