  "overview": "Fate played a strange joke with the Airborne Forces officer Vladimir Mendin (call sign \"Mendel\"): his whole life is spent among women. At home, his three daughters seized power long ago, and there was almost no room for vests on the hanger between the dresses. One day, Mendel's life becomes even more \"pink\" when, according to the will of the deceased general, he gets a successful wedding salon, which is run by Lena Zhukova, a confirmed bachelor. And everything would be fine, except that the general's widow and her new boyfriend seriously decided to take away the salon.",
