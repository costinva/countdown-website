  "overview": "The romantic idyll of Gena and Dasha, who have finally sent their children into adulthood and decided to live for their own pleasure, is disrupted by Roma and Sveta, who suddenly decide to visit their parents with their families, and even their children. And everything would be fine, but the Bukins' new neighbors do not want to live next to this booth. If before the Bukins drove the whole district crazy with four of them, now there will be much more of them.",
