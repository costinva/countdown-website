  "overview": "Who would not have heard of the Darwin Prize, which was founded by some young people more than ten years ago. The \"prize\" is awarded to those on the Internet who, by their last act, have demonstrated Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory that man is originally from the ape. The most unusual but certainly absurd deaths were unfortunate, according to the founders of the prize they deserved posthumous recognition because their lives mostly indirectly sacrifice their lives to preserve the useful genetic resources of humankind. With their death, they contribute to improving the long-term survival of the human race by eliminating the risk of spreading their genetic resources.",
