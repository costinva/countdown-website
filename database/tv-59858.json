  "overview": "The series is about Chief Inspector Benedikt Beissl (Andreas Giebel), who lives in Berchtesgaden with his wife Elisabeth and three daughters Maria, Johanna and Eva. Beissl has been ensuring law and order in Berchtesgaden for decades. To his displeasure, one day he was given a new colleague. So far, the solitary inspector has loved to do his thing alone. His new colleague Jerry Paulsen (Peter Marton) is the son of a black GI and the daughter of an innkeeper from Bad Aibling. He is quite daring and able to work in a team and moved from Hamburg to Bavaria for reasons of love. But Jerry's chosen one is, of all people, Beissl's daughter Johanna. The two police commissioners have to solve a murder in the area in each episode. The locally rooted Beissl often knows the victims as well as their surroundings and potential perpetrators.",
