  "overview": "An earthquake isolates a luxury hotel and the mountain valley in which it stands, causing a general blackout. Days pass, help does not arrive and communication seems impossible. Isolation and the gradual depletion of supplies increase the conflicts but give some of the survivors, first and foremost Giovanni and Claudia, murderer and unwitting victim, an unexpected chance of redemption. One question hovers over everything: what really happened outside that valley?",
