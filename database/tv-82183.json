  "overview": "The Takedown: American Aryans takes viewers inside the cult-like world of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas from the late 2000s to the present day. Told principally by charismatic federal agent Richard Boehning, the series examines an organized crime group built on Nazi ideology and extreme violence operating under the radar in the suburbs of Texas. The shocking murder of a young woman catapults Boehning and his Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) task force on an odyssey to protect American values against an enemy growing in confidence and power.",
