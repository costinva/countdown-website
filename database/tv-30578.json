  "overview": "This groundbreaking fixed-rig series takes you inside of one of the world's busiest local courts. The twelve magistrates that preside at Sydney's Downing Centre handle over 30,000 cases every year; everything from minor traffic offences to major assaults. It is a world full of emotion and drama, where bad behaviour comes face-to-face with the justice system. The endless stream of defendants can range from habitual offenders to everyday citizens that have made bad mistakes. Lives are on the line when society exercises the rule of law.",
