  "overview": "Jack, a captain who manages his personal life as poorly as his plane, and Charlie his co-pilot, relegated from a prestigious company to Flywingz, are forced to collaborate. To do this, they will be supported by an astonishing team of cabin crew: the naive Nelly, Nabil, the most unpredictable steward the sky has ever known, Tristan the arriviste, and Armelle, an activist in all battles. An inspection visit that turns into a fiasco, a child who takes the controls of the plane or a safety training session that goes awry: our (almost) always united team of broken arms will try as best they can to manage these absurd situations. And too bad if the methods adopted do not always respect security procedures. Good flight !Â ",
