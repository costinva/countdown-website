  "overview": "Battle of the Generations is a CTV Original quiz series hosted by award-winning entertainer, philanthropist, actress, producer, and writer, Lilly Singh. Each episode features four contestants from different generations – Baby Boomer, Gen X, Millennial, and Gen Z – as they face-off through multiple rounds of pop culture trivia. Contestants from across the country have to be both tactical and tenacious to be the last player standing, with the goal of entering The Vault, where they have the chance to win a cash prize of up to $25,000. Battle of the Generations not only asks questions from each contestant's generation, but from their rivals' generations too, determining who has what it takes to win it all.",
