  "overview": "On September 5, 2012, in a small mountain car park near Lake Annecy and the village of Chevaline, three members of a family of British vacationers and a local cyclist were murdered, shot to death. Dozens of shell casings litter the ground. This tragedy marks the beginning of one of the most sprawling and mysterious criminal cases of recent decades in Europe, which has still not been elucidated despite extensive investigations and modern means put in place.",
