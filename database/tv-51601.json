  "overview": "We live in repetitive daily routines, and it is time to take a break to find the balance of our body and minds. To enjoy the summer vacation, the half-time of our lives, Yu Mi and Woo Shik go to spend a daily life in a new place. It's a small village where the ocean spreads in the front yard and the sun shines warmly over you. They sometimes enjoy the moment by themselves or with their friends. It's about eating healthily, working out, and looking back ourselves. Will you come to our house?",
