  "overview": "Based on the comedy industry truism that some of the funniest material of the night is never seen because it happens behind the scenes, Backstage with Katherine Ryan will reveal what comedians get up to before, during, and after the show. While the camera usually stops at the curtain, this series stays with the comedians throughout the show, joining the inner-sanctum of comedy as they hang out backstage. This is where they let their guard down, the pressure of the live audience is off, and the real business of comedy begins. We will see their pre- and post-performance rituals, observe the chemistry between the comics, hear them critique eachothers' material, trade anecdotes, and enjoy the afterparty.",
