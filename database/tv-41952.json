  "overview": "This series presents a bold series of scientific experiments to delve deep into the way children experience life across Britain and the world today. Exploring key areas such as risk-taking, independence, morality and gender awareness in a range of scenarios, Planet Child seeks to further our understanding of children's development.Aged between four and seven years, the children's reactions to different challenges are tested to offer an eye-opening insight into their attitudes, behaviour and just what they are capable of when left unchecked by parental supervision.Planet Child also looks at radically different cultures across the world and asks what they can teach us about the experiences children are exposed to today, in our technologically driven 21st century environment.",
