  "overview": "Directed by Joshua Zeman, the series revisits the infamous string of murders that shook New York City in the late Seventies but also explores the argument that David Berkowitz wasn't a lone killer. To that end, the series delves into the work of journalist Maury Terry, who became convinced Berkowitz hadn't acted alone and spent decades trying to prove it.",
