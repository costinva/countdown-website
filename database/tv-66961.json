  "overview": "Finding forever homes for rescue dogs isn't easy, but that's exactly what the staff of Country Retreat Animal Sanctuary do every day. Set inside a rural Kiwi animal rescue known for its tireless commitment to rescuing animals in trouble, The Dog House NZ captures the joy and complexity of the human-dog \"dating\" experience.Each episode introduces tearful tales of abandoned dogs while also touching on backstories of families, couples and singletons all hoping their lives will be changed by a new four-legged friend. It's up to the sanctuary's dedicated staff led by husband-and-wife team Helen and Gavin to match pets with potential new owners and to arrange an all-important first date that will determine if the adorable pups and hopeful humans have that fated connection.",
