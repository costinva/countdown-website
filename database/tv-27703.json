  "overview": "It doesn't matter what you're sellingâ€“if you know your client and your product, a good salesman can sell anything to anyone. No one exemplifies this better than the leader of one of the top real estate teams in the U.S., Ryan Serhant (\"Million Dollar Listing New York\"). In Sell It Like Serhant, Ryan puts his sales skills to the ultimate test when he answers the call of struggling sales representatives, desperate for his expertise. While Ryan learns the tricks of a particular trade, he will also give under-performing employees a head-to-toe business overhaul and turn them into sales machines.",
