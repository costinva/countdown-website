  "overview": "Fashion student Chiaki dreams of seeing his designs on the runway, worn by none other than Ai—the charismatic male model who changed his life. When a prestigious competition promises to make that dream come true, Chiaki is fired up to win. But his hopes are dashed when he's paired with the clumsy and unfashionable Enaga for the project. One fateful night, after a run-in with some delinquents, Chiaki is unexpectedly saved by his idol Ai. Even more shocking, Ai seductively offers to teach him how to have fun at night…Caught between the alluring, mysterious model he worships and a clumsy, rough-around-the-edges classmate who can't seem to stay out of trouble (but may be hiding a surprising secret), Chiaki faces a heart-pounding, pure boy's love dilemma that will turn his world upside down!",
