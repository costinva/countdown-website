  "overview": "Wheeler dealer Terry Walker owns and runs one of the most successful scrap yards in Britain – despite the colourful cast of characters he employs. But it's not just scrap metal that turns him a tidy profit. He sees opportunities to make money everywhere and is always on the look for a nice little earner – anything from a job-lot of pyjamas to hand sanitiser. After all, you have to speculate to accumulate. But life at the yard is tough, as Terry's staff struggle to meet his ambitious targets to go global. And to make matters worse he and his wife Lyndsay don't always see eye to eye…Each week this series follows the adventures of Terry, his family and the cast of salespeople, mechanics, dropouts and spanner monkeys who work for him, as he battles to turn ‘muck into brass' from their Bolton scrapyard base.",
