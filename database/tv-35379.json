  "overview": "A story about a man who should be at the stage in his life where he's got everything figured out, yet finds that he has a lot of growing up to do in love and life as he gets reacquainted with his son. Wu Zheng is a pilot with a high-flying job and enviable good looks. He is more than capable of taking responsibility for the lives of countless passengers but outside of work, he is tameless, free spirited and basically a child at heart. His 16-year-old son turns up out of the blue followed by a teacher who's more than eager to help out. Needless to say, their arrival shakes up the life of a jet setter especially since Pilot and Teacher had met once before, when they were abroad, and their encounter wasn't pretty.",
