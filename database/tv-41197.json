  "overview": "The tumultuous account of Australia's ever-changing relationship with the British Royals, from the days of the First Fleet to the meteoric rise of the young royals. It's a story of tension, high emotion and divided loyalties. Australia's ties to the monarchy have outlived assassination attempts, the controversy of the Dismissal, a succession of salacious royal scandals and the push-pull of republicanism. In Australia, support for the Monarchy is at an all time high, especially among the young - the new generation of royals holds the promise of continuity, accessibility and celebrity. From the low point of Diana's tragic end to the turbo-charged appeal of her boys and their famous partners, from the outpourings of national affection during early the royal tours to the repeated calls for Australians to assert their full independence, this is a story that goes to the heart of both our national identity and the constitution.",
