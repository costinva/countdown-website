  "overview": "A-qiang is the most successful investigator in his precint, despite having a straightforward and distrustful personality. Yet, his finely honed observation skills and superb memory are offset by his uncontrollable emotions. Having spent most of his time at work during his four years of marriage, his wife left him. It is during this same time of emotional turmoil that he receives a missing-persons case: the owner of a popular bistro left one day, never to return. The only clue was a camera bag he took with him that was found on a beach. The owner's wife made the report, stating that her husband had been in depression. As the investigation continues, is this a case of suicide or murder?Â ",
