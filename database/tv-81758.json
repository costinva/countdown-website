  "overview": "Death of the Party takes a look at mysterious murder stories linked to house parties, banquets, concerts, festivals, or events. There's no environment like a party to create the perfect recipe for cold blooded murder. Each episode looks beyond the party favors and celebratory atmosphere to get to the bottom of the mysterious death that occurred. Did someone have a motive? Was it an accident? Or was it being in the wrong place at the wrong time? Detectives have their work cut out for them as they piece together the events of the evening from inaccurate witness accounts, cagey party goers, and a chaotic crime scene.",
