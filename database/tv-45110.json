  "overview": "Based in Val Thorens, one of the highest ski resorts in Europe with over 400,000 visitors each year, the dedicated team of rescuers and A&amp;E staff encounter a range of emergency situations and challenges every day. From the unfolding drama of the 999 call from the black run, through to the race against the clock - and the weather - to rescue and treat the patient, Ski A&amp;E follows the action every step of the way. And it's not just emergencies on the slopes. The various teams are on call 24/7 and, like in any bustling holiday resort, face all sorts of medical scenarios from altitude sickness, stomach bugs and fevers, to the occasional, overindulgent apr√®s skier.",
