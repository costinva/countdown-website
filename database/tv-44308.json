  "overview": "17 ex-pupils meet again after 25 years at a class reunion in HÃ¼rth. Of course, the archetypes should not be missing: the former best in class, the genius, the brat, the bully. But they are all in their mid-40s now and may have changed more or less. What has become of your former dreams and goals?",
