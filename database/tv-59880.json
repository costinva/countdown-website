  "overview": "Fibber McGee and Molly was an American radio show of the old-time radio era, and one of its longest-running comedies. An attempt at getting the McGees onto television came in September 1959, produced by William Asher for NBC (and co-sponsored by Singer Corporation and Standard Brands), with younger actors Bob Sweeney and Cathy Lewis in the roles. The show also featured Harold Peary as Mayor LaTrivia, rather than as Gildersleeve. The show was unable to recreate the flavor and humor of the original, and did not survive its first season; in fact, it did not even last through January 1960. But the Jordans themselves had resisted television far earlier. \"They were trying to push us into TV and we were reluctant,\" Jim Jordan told an interviewer many years later. \"Our friends advised us, 'Don't do it until you need to. You have this value in radioâ€”milk it dry.'\"",
