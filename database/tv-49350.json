  "overview": "Seven boys are planning a bank robbery in a small coastal village. Raffie, the head of the gang, desperately needs money - otherwise he, his grandmother and his little brother Luc will lose the roof over their heads because of enormous rental debts. The target is the bank of director Hispe, who previously roughly refused to grant Raffie's grandmother a loan. No one has ever managed to ransack Hispes Bank, but Raffie has a plan and gathers a gang to help him do it.",
