  "overview": "Santiago Ortiz is a sentimental consultant who works by giving advice for people to win over their loved one or improve their relationships in crisis. He counts on the help of his assistant, Arlete, with whom he lives in friction due to the unorthodox techniques taught for the art of conquest. Ironically, Santiago's daughter, Ganesha is a teenager who is always falling out of love and does not accept her father's advice as she considers it false, resorting to the help of her best friend, Ferrinho, who knows less about romance than she does.",
