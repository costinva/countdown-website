  "overview": "The Lakes is a series that tells the story of a summer in the life of one of Britain's favourite tourist hotspots through the fascinating characters who live and work there.From the peaks of its highest mountains to the depths of its deepest lakes, the Lake District is a part of the world renowned for its beauty and its influence on some of Britain's greatest poets and writers. In this series, we follow all the action as some of the Lakes' 15 million tourists a year descend on this stunning part of the north of England. We see hoteliers preparing for dream lakeside weddings, tour guides welcoming visitors from far afield as Japan and a tea room owner preparing to open her doors for the first time. But this is a place where danger also lurks and in this series we see the mountain rescue team and lake wardens hard at work across the busy summer. The Lakes - experience life in Britain's favourite â€˜great escape'.",
