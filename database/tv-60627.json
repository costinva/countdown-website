  "overview": "Zachowaj spokój is another Netflix title based on the novel by Harlan Coben. The six-episode series is set in a wealthy housing estate, where the local community leads a quiet life with close relationships. Everything changes when 18-year-old Adam disappears without a trace. The danger escalates quickly, and the worried parents do everything they can to protect their children who, on the verge of adulthood, have decided to take matters into their own hands. Hold Tight is a dynamic, twist-filled thriller that, while not a sequel to The Woods, will feature the fate of several protagonists of Harlan Coben's first screen adaptation.",
