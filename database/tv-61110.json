  "overview": "Wrong is about a group of people in their late twenties who are all struggling to grow up. The fact that, when in doubt, the roommates primarily have their own advantage in mind does not make it any easier. And what is the least you need? A penetrating camera team that also – or especially then – sticks to it when it gets really \"wrong\"! The team was actually only supposed to accompany the blogger Melisa and shoot a short portrait of her life. But after an extravagant party night with a \"wrong\" ending, the other residents have no choice but to sign the editor's gag contract. From now on, the WG will be accompanied at every turn. With all their problems, embarrassments and outrages. The quota-fixed camera team sticks to it, no matter what happens. Tears, casualties, illegal activities - the camera's pause button is not an option, even if it could harm someone.",
