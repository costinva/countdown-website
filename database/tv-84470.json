  "overview": "Bad Nanny tells the story of Samantha Cookes who, for over a decade across Ireland and the UK, used a revolving door of aliases including Carrie Jade Williams and Sadie Harris to weave an intricate web of lies, deceiving everyone from vulnerable families to online communities. Her story was the subject of RTÉ podcast series The Real Carrie Jade.  With gripping first-hand accounts, chilling insight into psychological manipulation, shocking revelations, and raw emotion, the TV documentary series is a must-watch exposé on one woman's decade-long con and the strength of those who brought her down. It features exclusive interviews with victims of Samantha's scams who have never spoken publicly and includes unseen archive footage of Samantha. ",
