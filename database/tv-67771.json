  "overview": "Five competitive holidaymakers battle it out to see who can organise the most entertaining 24 hours of holiday fun.Each day one of them takes control of the vacation in a bid to prove they're the host with the most. Although they have the same budget, they all have unique plans and preferences. The guests provide a daily score on the host's choice of daytime excursion, night out and hotel. At the end of the week the host who tops the leaderboard wins a holiday of their own with spending money.",
