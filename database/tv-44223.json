  "overview": "Kodnipa was an orphan girl who went to the city to pursue her education. There, she \"befriended\" Jirapat, a wealthy heir. Their friendship was based on a mutual benefit, with Jirapat paying her to do trivial things and Kodnipa accepting the money she needed by acting as his servant. Things got complicated when Jirapat impregnated a girl who Kodnipa knew and abandoned the baby in Kodnipa's house. Since Jirapat could not officially proclaim his child as his own due to his circumstances, he offered Kodnipa two million baht, a condo and monthly \"wages\" in exchange for Kodnipa's help in raising the baby as her own. Otherwise, he would send the child to an orphanage. Kodnipa reluctantly accepted as she was against sending the child to the orphanage. Growing up, she started to love Mochi, Jirapat's baby, like her own. However, her fate was later entangled with Kirakorn, Jirapat's older brother, resulting in a complicated relationship with the two.",
