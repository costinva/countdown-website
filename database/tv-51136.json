  "overview": "Chicken Shop Date combines fried chicken with flirting in a one of a kind interview format. The charm of Chicken Shop Date lies both within the UK's love for Chicken Shops and also the dynamic of presenter and guest. Amelia's dry humour has the ability to disarm the media trained front of her musical guests to provide the audience with a show that presents grime/uk rap culture as it is rarely seen. Above all, Chicken Shop Date proves that whoever said romance is dead has never been on a date to Chicken Cottage.",
