  "overview": "In prehistoric times a strange pink stone with an imaginable power crashed on Earth. This stone was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs, getting buried under the ground for thousands of years. Tony, Laila, Azim, Nina, David and Boris are six friends who live an ordinary life in the city of Vila Tornasol, to discover the plans of the malicious Miss C. Lebrity. Her goal is to dominate the world using the effects of the pink stone, doing everything to remove it from the center of the Earth. Due to this, the kids are chosen by the guard of Vila Tornasol, Peter Solfa, to protect their city from attacks by the villain. The children form the literal \"band\" of superheroes, and utilize the powers of their magical instruments.",
