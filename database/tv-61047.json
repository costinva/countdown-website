  "overview": "This is the story of chaotic teenagers whose love for dancing Nah Han is at the heart of their existence. Yuphin must choose between two guys: one she can't forget and another who's extremely good. Sawan is a mor lam (Isan singer). Singto sells amulets at the market fair. Tlemai is under a lot of pressure to study hard and behave like a \"true man\". He persuades Calcium, a friend in their group, to pose as his girlfriend. The hope is that if they manage to keep it up until graduation they can leave the village and live the lives they want to. That plan gets complicated when he meets Kay and Calcium becomes confused when playing Tlemai's girlfriend every day stirs up new feelings.Â ",
