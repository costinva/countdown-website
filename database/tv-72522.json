  "overview": "When the Epang Palace was burned to the ground two thousand years ago, the School of Naturalists' ancestors lamented that Qin Shihuang had degraded Confucians and burned books, saying that \"if you don't teach the world, all the talents will be wasted.\" When the literati died, he started to concentrate their souls. To ensure that his skills are passed down to future generations, finish the Chinese brush. A normal college student named Luo Zhongxia accidently acquired Li Bai's Qinglian posthumous Chinese brush two thousand years later, and ever then, he has held the superpowers provided by the brush spirit. The happy times did not endure, however, as other forces were drawn to the potent influence of Qinglian's works, which frequently put Luo Zhongxia in danger. Luo Zhongxia dedicated himself to finding a way to retract his essay in order to prevent conflicts, but he kept running across roadblocks. He instead developed a strong bond with the \"Seven Lords in charge of the city\".",
