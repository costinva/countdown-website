  "overview": "Million-dollar purses, model girlfriends and trips to the mall to shop in the boys' department. Animal Planet brings viewers into a world dominated by ferocious rivalries, fierce bonds and extraordinary risk, ruled by short men with silk shirts, oversized personalities and big dreams. Follow the fortunes of a group of jockeys and horses that live together in a \"colony\" over the course of a 30-day racing season. It's a month of go-for-broke drama as we see fisticuffs off the track and bone-breaking spills on the track as well as a deepening bond between riders and horses. Big winners who've won horse racing's richest purses live in the same bunkhouse with jockeys who never won a race and must place in each day's competitions if they're to make rent. The series showcases the day-to-day competition where five-foot-tall jockeys weighing 115 lbs. fly down the track on 1,500lb. thoroughbreds. Meet the superstar athletes whose livelihoods depend on their relationships with their horses and whose success depends on knocking the competition out of the winner's circle.",
