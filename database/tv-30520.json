  "overview": "IGN and Disney are teaming up to bring gamers The IGN Show, premiering 17 July on Disney XD. The nightly show will cover everything you're into, from new trailers, exclusive first looks at all the hottest games, in-depth reviews, and all the latest news. The IGN Show will also be hitting the road all summer long to bring you behind-the scenes access to huge events like Comic-Con, Anime Expo, EVO, PAX, GamesCom and plenty more. Starting this Monday, IGN will be joining Disney XD for D|XP, a brand new block of nightly gaming content. We'll be running episodes Monday through Friday for the next two weeks, and then coming back in mid-August for another four week run. That's thirty episodes of content about your favorite games from your favorite IGN creators. We've got loads of fun things planned, including features on Overwatch, Destiny 2, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Spider-Man, and more. We'll also be taking you to the floor of big events like VidCon, Anime Expo, and Comic Con.",
