  "overview": "Picking up a few last minute items at the mall when violent gunmen storm the store...what to do? What if, on the daily subway commute, a bio weapon is released? Or a fire is blazing in the 12th floor office and the only way out is blocked? Disasters can strike at the most unexpected times, but Spike TV's original series Surviving Disaster, led by Cade Courtley, vividly takes viewers through catastrophic scenarios and arms them with the knowledge needed to survive the unthinkable. Navy SEAL Courtley is the ideal host for this timely series, having faced imminent danger for a living, conducting clandestine missions from the sea, air and land that include counter-terrorism operations, special reconnaissance and unconventional warfare.",
