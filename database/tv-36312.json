  "overview": "In 1901, Ned, a middle-class schoolboy whose parents are working abroad, spends his summer in Bedfordshire with his great-uncle Silas. Though 60 years old, Silas relishes life--he's a womanizer, drinker, and a poacher. At the prompting of his long-suffering housekeeper, Mrs. Betts, he takes on the occasional odd job.",
