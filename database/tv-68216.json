  "overview": "Ruby Wax has been battling with depression for over 25 years. Now she's putting her own mind through the ultimate test: she'll be marooned on an isolated Madagascan Island for ten days, pitting her wits against the uncompromising force of Mother Nature on a true desert island with only herself and her cameras to talk to. It'll be tough, solitary and unforgiving, but it will also be a chance to confront her fears and, she hopes, raise the public discussion about mental health.Filmed across two episodes, Ruby will experience life alone as a true castaway as she documents her experience using her own handheld camera, isolated sound pack and wearable body-cams. Her kids and husband Ed give their advice in London before she leaves, and original island TV survival poster girl and close personal friend Joanna Lumley adds her tips for survival, before Ruby is completely isolated on the island, where we'll get inside her mind 24 hours a day as the experience plays out. One woman. Ten days. The ultimate survival experience. Ruby Wax: Cast Away will be an epic study of solitude and mental fortitude - where Ruby's biggest challenge will be her own mind.",
