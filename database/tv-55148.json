  "overview": "Martin Lewis introduces some of Britain's most extreme savers - who are willing to keep hold of their cash.From those who utilise reusable toilet rolls to those who shower in rainwater, to foraging for food and living off-grid - this programme features people who have made it their life's mission to save as much cash as they can, often using the advice of Martin, but taking it even further.",
