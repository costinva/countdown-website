  "overview": "Irreverent is a fish out of water drama that follows criminal mediator Paulo Keegan as he flees Chicago and the United States after a mediation gone wrong and assumes the identity of Reverend Mackenzie \"Mack\" Boyd. Paulo posing as \"Mack\" finds himself trapped in Clump, Australia - a small, eccentric beach town in Far North Queensland hundreds of miles away from civilization and phone reception. In order to stay alive, \"Mack\" must keep the wool over the town's eyes and play the role of devoted Reverend, while desperately searching for an exit strategy before his past catches up to him.",
