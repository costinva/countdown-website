  "overview": "Teddy the cuddly toy bear realizes only after jesting, ranting and threatening to hold his breath that the children have dumped him, just like a rag-doll in the neighbours' bin, to be replaced by electronic games. Barely escaping the waste yard, the toys desperately search for new homes and owners, a journey along canine and human strays.",
