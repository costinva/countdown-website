  "overview": "Reframed: Marilyn Monroe is a four-part CNN Original Series that revisits the extraordinary story of a girl who sprang from nowhere to become the most famous woman in the world. Narrated by Golden Globe-winning actress Jessica Chastain and featuring a star-studded cast of female voices, the series re-examines Monroe's story to uncover themes of feminism, sexuality, and power that continue to drive the cultural conversation today. It reveals a complex, fascinating woman who took on powerbrokers in Hollywood and courageously challenged the misogyny of 1950s America, all while beating the odds to succeed in a man's world. Marilyn's story isn't just the story of one woman—in many ways, it is the story of every woman.",
