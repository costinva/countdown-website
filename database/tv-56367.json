  "overview": "Arven etter 22.juli is about the last decade in Norway, seen through the eyes of three young people who survived the terror. How have your lives been after the roses disappeared and the court settlement was completed? And have we as a society managed to keep the promises from the rose trains about more democracy, tolerance and humanism?",
