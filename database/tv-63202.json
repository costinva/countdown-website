  "overview": "With millions of followers and a loyal fanbase, comedy group The Try Guys, including Keith Habersberger, Ned Fulmer, Zach Kornfeld and Eugene Lee Yang, are well-known for their curiosity, humor and willingness to try anything under the sun, often with hilarious results.  The four fearless best friends and business partners also love food and trying to cook new dishes with zero instruction and in No-Recipe Road Trip with the Try Guys, they test their culinary instincts to recreate signature menu items in restaurants across the country – and the final dishes are all over the map.  In each episode, the guys hit a new city and visit two local establishments where each must attempt to make the restaurant's best-known dish with no recipe or instruction. In the end, the Try Guy with the most successful dish as determined by a local chef and guest judge wins and gets the chance to have their dish put on the restaurant's menu. ",
