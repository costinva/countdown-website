  "overview": "A multidisciplinary clinic treating a wide range of traumas and human dramas. A variety of medical specialists work here, from anaesthetists and gynaecologists to plastic surgeons. Nurses are also available, where without them. Every day, these people not only save lives, treat illnesses and help people, they also have their own lives - their own problems, which, more often than not, lead to extremely difficult life situations. You may doubt it, but these doctors care about their own problems, and they care a lot!",
