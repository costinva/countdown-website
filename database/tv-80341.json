  "overview": "Level seven government worker Jung Ha-na's dream is to retire peacefully, but her feisty attitude lands her in the Marriage Promotion Team at Injeong City Hall, a role she finds baffling as she doesn't believe in marriage herself. To make matters worse, her ex-boyfriend Ki-jun, whom she nearly married three years ago, appears as her new team leader, adding to her disbelief. Desperate to escape the team, Ha-na is tasked with marrying off local bachelor Cheol-hee. Though Cheol-hee initially refuses, believing he's not suited for marriage, Ha-na's determination gradually softens his heart. As they open up to each other, Ha-na and Cheol-hee, who both doubted their worthiness of marriage, find themselves questioning if they can take the plunge after all. Will Ha-na and Cheol-hee finally gather the courage to believe in love and marriage?",
