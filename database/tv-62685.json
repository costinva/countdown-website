  "overview": "Desi and Cata are employees of a cleaning company. Well, they used to be. They were fired overnight. Stressed about money and barely scraping by, they receive a miracle in the form of a phone call: They have been asked to clean the mansion of the Rosell√≥s, one of the most powerful families in Alicante. Everything is going well until they find a woman's dead body. Horror. Panic. Call the Police. But after the initial shock, Cata and Desi clean the crime scene, leaving it spotless - and making them the perfect suspects. Soon, the police are after them. But so are Russian hitmen, a family of millionaires, and an ex-husband with a mariachi band. We'll see how they get themselves out of this mess.",
