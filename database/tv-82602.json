  "overview": "Accused: Did I Do It? follows the high-stakes stories of individuals who stood trial and are facing charges for serious offenses such as first-degree murder, manslaughter, domestic terrorism and aggravated assault. Every piece of evidence may lead to an answer, but the truth is never quite clear until the final moment of reveal. Intimately filmed in prisons and homes across the US, the location of the accused is kept a mystery as the story unfolds. Key turning points, evidence, and decisions that led to charges and eventual verdicts are pieced together with nail-biting testimony, explosive trial footage, and interviews with their defense attorneys and family members.Â ",
