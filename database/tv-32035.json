  "overview": "Dinky Dog was an 11-minute animated segment on \"The All-New Popeye Hour\". The show is about two girls, ditzy blonde Sandy and smart Monica, living with their uncle, Dudley. Sandy bought a cute pup who suddenly grew the size of a horse, and she is now stuck dragging Monica into always finding work and different ways to repair the damages Dinky causes at their poor uncle's expense. However, Dinky always seems to fix things in an unexpected way and is forgiven, much to uncle Dudley's dislike.",
