  "overview": "Laurel Canyon is a two-part docu-series that pulls back the curtain on a mythical world and provides an up-close look at the lives of the musicians who inhabited it. Through a wealth of rare and newly unearthed footage and audio recordings, the series features an intimate portrait of the artists who created a musical revolution that changed popular culture. Uniquely immersive and experiential, this event takes us back in time to a place where a rustic canyon in the heart of Los Angeles became a musical petri dish. Featuring the music of Joni Mitchell, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, The Doors, Linda Ronstadt, Eagles, and many more.",
