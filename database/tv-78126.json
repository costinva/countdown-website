  "overview": "In this programme we ask one simple question: can you tell the difference between the brand and the own brands, and which do you prefer?Own brands used to carry a stigma. They were bland, boring and came in plain packaging. But now they have upped their game and are taking on the brands head on. The packaging often looks similar, and the names can be very cheeky. But when you strip it all back, can the taste match that of the brand? Some people refer to them as knock offs, others call them dupesâ€¦ they are the supermarket own brands.",
