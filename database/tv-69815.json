  "overview": "Makabe Yukiko, the head of the Special Investigation Team's Third Section, prides herself on her superior negotiation skills. She tries to convince a criminal who is holding a bus hostage. However, an unanticipated situation arises and she fails. Yukiko is held fully responsible and is ordered to transfer to the Emergency Investigation Response Team, which goes by the name of Kintori. The director, Kajiyama Katsutoshi, whom she has always not got along well with, heads the Kintori. It is a professional team of outstanding interrogators put together to carry out interrogations, particularly for cases that are deemed important. Yukiko embarks on a new chapter at the Kintori surrounded by idiosyncratic veterans Hishimoto Susumu, Nakata Zenjiro, Koishikawa Haruo. She also determines the truth of an unsolved case deeply linked to her past.",
