  "overview": "A two-part science fiction miniseries that reimagines the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica. Set in a distant star system, humanity is nearly wiped out by a devastating surprise attack from the Cylonsâ€”sentient machines originally created by humans. As the last surviving warship, Battlestar Galactica leads a ragtag fleet of civilian ships on a desperate search for a new home: a mythical planet called Earth. The miniseries introduces key characters like Commander William Adama, President Laura Roslin, and the mysterious Number Six, and serves as the official pilot to the critically acclaimed 2004 television series (aired in US in 2005).",
