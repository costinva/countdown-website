  "overview": "Butchers of L.A. sheds new light on the horrifying crimes of the \"Freeway Killers\" who terrorized Southern California over two decades.From the early 1970s, gay men were being savagely murdered and their bodies carelessly discarded along Southern California's highways. Initially, police suspected a single perpetrator, but the detectives' investigation ultimately revealed that three killers were operating, independently of each other, in the same vicinity. With intertwined storylines and dramatic twists and turns throughout, Butchers of L.A. exposes three sadistic serial killers — Patrick Kearney, William Bonin, and Randy Kraft — and explains the truth behind these horrifying events.",
