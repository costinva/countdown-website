  "overview": "Fat Friends is an ITV drama (made by Tiger Aspect and Yorkshire Television), following a group of overweight people, their laughter and pain and addresses the absurdities of dieting in our modern age. The drama looks at people and how they relate to one another and use body weight as an excuse for all sorts of failings in their relationships, or not living their lives to the full. A later sitcom, Gavin and Stacey used a very similar cast. The premise of the programme is set around a slimming club in the Headingley district of Leeds. The club is run by the formidable Carol, who fruitlessly tries to get her attendees to follow the 'Super Slimmers' diet. The characters who attend the club are from varied backgrounds and of varied weight. Whilst there is plots ongoing throughout all four series', each episode focus' on one particular character.",
