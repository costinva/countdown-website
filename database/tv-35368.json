  "overview": "In Dream School, famous Dutch people try to inspire school-leavers to develop themselves. The young people who are central are between 16 and 23 years old and all stranded in the regular school system. In the middle of the wooded area of Hilversum is a monastery that has been transformed for three weeks into the Dream School of kickboxer Lucia Rijker and rector Eric van 't Zelfde. Their dream is that the teachers at Dream School will succeed in getting through to the drop outs. But these young people have not fallen out of their schools for nothing. Both the young people and the teachers go through a violent process and weekly several socially urgent problems become painfully visible.",
