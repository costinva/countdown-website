  "overview": "Hey Paula provides an unfiltered, real-life look at the \"American Idol\" judge, entrepreneur, choreographer and multi-platinum artist, giving insight and context to Abdul's much-reported on professional and personal life. Hey Paula paints a three-dimensional portrait of Abdul and her \"Crazy Cool\" world â€“ from the stressed celebrity and tough business woman to the comedic prankster. Viewers will see Abdul up close 24/7 as she battles insomnia during the much-talked-about \"American Idol\" satellite media tour interviews; bumps heads with QVC execs; develops her own fragrance and plays practical jokes on her assistants. Through it all, Abdul has a knack for being able to laugh along the way. On her singing career, she quips, \"Last time I had a hit record, Bill and Hillary were having sex...that's a long time ago.\" And Abdul jokes about Cowell with a QVC security guard, \"If someone comes that has dark hair, that looks like Beavis and Butthead haircut and has a tight shirt...and he has a British accent, do not let him in.\" Additionally, the seven-episode series features the posse of people essential in keeping the Abdul empire running smoothly. The Hey Paula players include Daniel, her hairstylist and BFF, who always promises a good time; Jeff, her longtime publicist of seven years, who protects her like a sister; Kiley, her full-time wardrobe assistant, who keeps Abdul looking her best; and Abdul's kids...her four Chihuahuas - Bessie Moo, Chomps, Thumbelina and Tulip.",
