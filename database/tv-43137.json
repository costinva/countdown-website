  "overview": "Best friends and ghost hunters Dalen Spratt, Juwan Mass and Marcus Harvey are responding to pleas from families experiencing paranormal activity in their homes. Traveling across the country to answer the calls for help, Dalen, Juwan and Marcus move right in to embed themselves with eight different families for a weekend slumber party. This isn't your average sleepover though. Throughout the weekend, Dalen, Juwan and Marcus spend time investigating each family's paranormal claims. Before they say their goodbyes, their goal is to bring peace to the home's inhabitants--both the living and the departed.",
