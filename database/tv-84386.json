  "overview": "What does it take to become the most influential female podcaster of a generation? Following Alex Cooper as she prepares for her first tour, this compelling two-part documentary series traces Cooper's evolutionâ€”from a self-conscious kid growing up in Pennsylvania to the voice behind \"Call Her Daddy,\" a podcast that redefined the conversation for women everywhere. The series offers an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at the life-defining events that shaped Cooper's journey as she grew from a 24-year-old woman with a sex and dating podcast to the CEO of a media empire in just six years. More than just a success story, it's a portrait of a woman who is creating a space where women feel seen, heard, and empowered.",
