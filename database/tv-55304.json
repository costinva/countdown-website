  "overview": "The Little Prince lives on Astroid B612, a tiny rock floating in space. He spends his days cleaning out the three small volcanos on the astroid (which he aslo uses to cook his breakfast) weeding out the baobob trees that threaten to take over, and caring for his friend the Rose Girl. When he gets lonely for company he catches a comet in his butterfly net and flies off to Earth for all sorts of adventures.",
