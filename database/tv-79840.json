  "overview": "Evidence of an impending attack in Hamburg puts the police authorities on alert. The focus is on the aging LKA man Gabriel Bach and the young BKA officer Holly Valentin. Out of necessity, they recruit the Afghan substitute teacher Raza Shaheen as an informant, who has previously had absolutely nothing to do with terrorism or organized crime. Under enormous time pressure, they work to save lives in the midst of a maelstrom of fear, prejudice and hysteria - and in doing so put themselves in great danger.",
