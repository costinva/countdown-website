  "overview": "Part road show, part food adventure, part talk show, The Feed celebrates food in all its creative, ingenious glory. Three unique and distinctly opinionated hosts--culinary expert Gail Simmons, superstar chef Marcus Samuelsson, and comedian and food writer Max Silvestri--anchor a rollicking adventure into the world of cooking, food trends and food culture in America. From edible fireworks to beef jerky business cards to the next big food mash-up, they don't just talk about what's happening right now in the food world; they get their hands dirty and challenge each other to push food culture forward.",
