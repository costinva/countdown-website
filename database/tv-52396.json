  "overview": "Julia Bradbury takes viewers to parts of the West Country that can only be explored on foot - from the epic wilderness of Dartmoor, to the white sands and azure seas of the Atlantic coastline, to the soaring cliffs of Land's End.From beautiful beaches to ancient woodlands and winding estuaries, this uplifting new series harnesses the country's love of the outdoors and the best walks the south west has to offer.Cornwall and Devon are home to thousands of miles of the country's most varied terrain and walking routes, and along the way Julia meets the people who live and work in these two counties as well as sampling some of its legendary fare.Â During the series, she visits Salcombe, Dartmoor, the Dart Valley, Isles of Scilly, Land's End, Helford, The Lizard and Padstow.",
