  "overview": "Lucy Worsley discovers how the history of the Reformation has been manipulated and mythologised by generations of politicians and writers.Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon created a religious and political schism between England and Europe that can be still be felt in Britain today. The Reformation is often portrayed as a lusty Royal soap opera, but Lucy reveals that it was about far more than a randy King in pursuit of a younger wife and a long-awaited male heir. It also laid the foundations for our modern constitution and economic power as an Empire.",
