  "overview": "Begins in 1972, when Anker JÃ¸rgensen - very surprisingly - becomes Prime Minister. He has not applied for the job himself and comes from a background as an unskilled worker. The series follows his life through a hectic decade, where he both loses power and subsequently regains it several times, while at the same time he walks the difficult balancing act between doing the right thing for the country without getting the powerful trade union movement on his back.",
