  "overview": "Comedians Watching Football with Friends sees comedians, and friends, watch two of the big televised weekend matches while they offer sofa-situated analysis and generally chew the fat.Each game will be recorded in two sitting room style studios simultaneously, reflecting what's going on in living rooms up and down the country; with a live audience of partisan fans oohing, ahhing and laughing along, while two comedians and one celebrity super-fan offer their thoughts on the game, or anything else, as the action unfolds.",
