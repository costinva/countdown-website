  "overview": "Teams of three players start with £1 million and attempt to correctly answer seven general knowledge questions to keep the jackpot intact.Every right answer locks in a digit of the One and Six Zeros jackpot. Every wrong answer, however, loses a zero from the prize fund, and the money can quickly decline from £1 million to £100.After three questions the team is then reduced to two players. After five questions, only one player remains to answer the final two questions and secure the prize money.",
