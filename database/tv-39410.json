  "overview": "Throughout a compelling and turbulent year, BBC Two has gained privileged access to the private and fascinating world of British diplomats in Whitehall and embassies around the globe, from Burma to Ukraine. We follow them as they tackle global crises from Russia to Burma, and see how decisions made now - as the UK prepares to exit the European Union - will shape its new relationships on the world stage. We also see the often overlooked and complex roles of British diplomats, as Britons who find themselves in serious trouble abroad turn to them in need of urgent help: from the Forced Marriage Unit that looks after distressed British victims, to locating Britains stranded after Hurricane Irma, to helping a British man jailed in Cambodia.",
