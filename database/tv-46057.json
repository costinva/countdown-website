  "overview": "This collection brings us some of Desmond Morris' TV programmes about the Animal World. We know him as a renowned author, but he has also appeared in around 500 episodes of \"Zootime\" for Granada and 100 \"Life in the Animal World\" programmes for the BBC. Beside a highly-respected broadcaster and author, Morris is also a celebrated artist and a revered academic. In this collection we meet farmyard animals and pets, which after generations of domestication still have many features of their wild ancestors.",
