  "overview": "The show follows the very first FHM Stand-Up Hero competition which set out to find Britain's best undiscovered stand-up comedian. As well as looking at some of the entrants en route to the grand final, and giving the finalists some advice on the big night itself, it also gets some insider knowledge, and hears some hilarious tales of life behind the mic from well known comedians.",
