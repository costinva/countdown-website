  "overview": "When Liu Xi Lai and Tian Tian first met it was like a meteorite hitting Earth. And yet Xi Lai found that this girl who challenged him seemed to be the only thing that could stop himself from blushing, so he decided to keep his little \"antidote\" by his side as his assistant. Who could be more surprised to find that as they spent time together and formed a strong bond, a strong and beautiful love quietly grew between these two.Â ",
