  "overview": "Shaun Micallef drank neither wisely nor well back in his university days and swore off it in his mid-twenties. Now his sons have hit drinking age, it's got him thinking - what kind of national drinking culture are they getting into?In this timely documentary Shaun looks beyond clich√©s and misconceptions to discover the new face of alcohol in Australia. It's changing rapidly, right under our noses.\"Personally, I've never quite understood alcohol. I don't get it. It tastes funny and I'm not very good at it. Two glasses of beer and I'm under the table. So about thirty years ago, I decided I'd be better off without it. But I have children now of drinking age, and I'm wondering what advice I can give them about drinking if I don't understand it?\" said host Shaun Micallef.Across the series, Shaun explores Australia's long and torrid love affair with alcohol and journeys around the country meeting people whose lives have been touched by alcohol in good ways and bad.",
