  "overview": "Guy Fieri and his son Hunter decide to take a trip down memory lane and watch one of their favorite GGG episodes: All-Star Vegetarian Games. Hunter surprises his dad by challenging him to cook along with the challenges featured in the show. Guy gets a taste of what he puts chefs through as Hunter makes sure his dad follows all the challenge rules and sticks to the 30-minute clock. GGG judge Justin Warner joins Guy to assess his dishes, compare them to the dishes in the episode and decide if Guy is able to keep up with his own challenges.",
