  "overview": "The Toe Bro follows foot specialist Jonathan Tomines who treats a range of shocking foot problems for patients who come from far and wide seeking his help. There is nothing \"The Toe Bro\" won't clip, slice, or scoop until suffering is a thing of the past. These oddly satisfying and cringe-worthy procedures, combined with Jonathan's bed-side manner, leave patients with newfound confidence.",
