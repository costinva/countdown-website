  "overview": "In Ireland we are living through one of the worst housing crisis since the foundation of the State. Today there are over 77,000 houses in mortgage arrears, rental demand is far outstripping supply, there are 91,000 people on social housing waiting lists and more than 7,000 people in emergency accommodation.As policy makers scramble to offer solutions it is clear that we are standing at a crossroads and the decisions that are made now will have a lasting impact on generations to come.IRELAND'S PROPERTY CRISIS offers a snapshot of seven days in Ireland with some of those who are on the frontline of the crisis. Whether they are people finding a way out of negative equity, looking for somewhere to rent, resisting eviction, hoping to buy their first home, or simply trying to find a bed for the night, the series gives an in-depth, personal view to help inform a national discussion at this crucial time in our history.",
