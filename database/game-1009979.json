  "overview": "In Guns Can’t Walk, movement isn’t just part of the game — it’s the challenge. You can’t run, you can’t walk… your only way forward is through recoil. Armed with a skateboard and a shotgun, you’ll use controlled chaos to fling yourself across office floors and into ridiculous situations — all while racing the clock and fighting gravity.Inspired by the punishing spirit of Foddian platformers, Guns Can’t Walk is a rage-inducing, skill-based climb where every mistake costs you progress… and every perfect landing feels like a victory.",
