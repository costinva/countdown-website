  "overview": "The US Fish and Wildlife Services has a special unit; The Office of Law Enforcement. It boasts 261 special agents. It even has its own Forensic Laboratory which supports international investigations of wildlife crimes. The unit exists because, over the last five years, it has become apparent to the West that many of the world's terrorist attacks are funded by the cash generated from animal poaching. This series is the story of some of their investigations as the Office of Law Enforcement battles the richest and most determined wildlife criminals in the world.",
