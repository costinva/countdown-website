  "overview": "Travel with a Goat is set to spark debate about life and death decisions behind every day eating habits. Each episode sees two international foodies from two different countries meet for the first time and travel from point A to point B. However, there's a catch â€“ these foodies have to travel with an animal that is destined for the slaughterhouse. They travel with the animal for over four days and have to make the decision at the end of the journey on whether the animal will be killed, or if they will allow it to live.",
