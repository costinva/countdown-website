  "overview": "Giuliani: What Happened to America's Mayor? explores how a storied figure in American politics went from a crime-fighting prosecutor to a key player in President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This four-part series goes behind the headlines to explore Giuliani's operatic life of victories and defeats from his heyday in the Southern District of New York to his mayoralty and critical role in the Trump administration. It asks how the man some considered a hero in the aftermath of 9/11 became a key architect of President Donald Trump's election conspiracies. It weaves together a rich tapestry of archival footage and illuminating interviews with influential friends and former colleagues from his multi-decade career. This revealing series is the definitive telling of the Giuliani story, exposing the psyche of one of America's most iconic politicians. ",
