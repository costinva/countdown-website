  "overview": "A brand-new, hilarious sports panel show hosted by comedian Mark Watson (‘Mock the Week', ‘Buzzcocks' and ‘Have I Got News for You' regular and full-time Bristol City fan). Mark Watson Kicks Off is a riotous, no-holds-barred celebration of ‘the Beautiful Game' and all that makes British sport great... or more specifically... quite promising, frequently over-hyped and ultimately disappointing.",
