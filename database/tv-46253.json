  "overview": "Then You Run tells the story of Tara O'Rourke, who, when she kills her estranged father in a drug fuelled rage, her best friends are forced to flee across Europe in search of Tara's long-lost mother. Along the way, the girls have to navigate depleting funds, awkward romances and an inconvenient pregnancy – but the biggest danger comes from Tara's uncle, Reagan – because the girls made the mistake of stealing Reagan's drug stash… and he happens to be the most feared gangster in Rotterdam. And all the while, the spectre of a mythical serial killer known as The Traveller inches ever closer.",
