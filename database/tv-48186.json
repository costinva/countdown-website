  "overview": "There are two sides to every story, but in a murder, one side dies with the victim. Each episode of The Killer Truth tells the story of a single murder through the five people most intimately connected to the case. These five distinct points of view may include the victim's family, the lead detective, a reporter who covered the case, the suspect linked to the crime, the defense attorney, and finally, even the killer. The five perspectives take us through the twists and turns of each case, create a full picture of the crime, and ultimately lead to justice.",
