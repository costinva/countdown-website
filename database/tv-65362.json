  "overview": "Dome, a barista at a café on the verge of closure, receives an unexpected job offer. The offer comes from a café regular, Khatha, who orders coffee he never drinks. The job is at an odd museum open only after sunset. With few choices, Dome accepts Khatha's offer. On his first day, an employee tells him the museum is haunted. Forbidden by the overseer from entering Zone 16, Dome is tempted inside. Khatha attempts to contain the damage, but Dome has unintentionally awakened things and nearly everything inside manages to slip out. Dome takes responsibility and, with Khatha, attempts to hunt down what went missing in order to return them to where they belong.",
