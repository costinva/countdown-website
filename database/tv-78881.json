  "overview": "In today's world, kids are given far less freedom and independence than in previous generations.In this provocative, surprising and entertaining two-part series, we take a diverse range of nine and ten-year-olds, all from different walks of life, and give them their first taste of adult life.Grouped in three, and with their parents watching apprehensively from a secret location, we see how the children react to their newly found independence in the big bad world. Across each episode, the children are placed in challenging scenarios that test their common sense, their ability to think for themselves, recognise danger and act independently, while their parents watch on, in both shock and delight.",
