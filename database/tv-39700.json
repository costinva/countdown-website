  "overview": "Occupation Double follows the life of single women and men from Quebec who all have one thing in common: they're looking for love. During several weeks, the women and the men selected to be a part of the adventure live in a dream location abroad. The female and male candidates live separately in two luxury houses next to one another. Through activities, trips and parties, the single women and men spend time together and get to know each other. Every week, the women must eliminate a man, or the men must eliminate a woman, until there's only one winning couple left. The winning couple receives many prizes, including a house.",
