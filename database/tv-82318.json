  "overview": "After a sheriff's deputy found a woman zip-tied and frantic on the side of the road in the Mojave Desert in 2012, authorities discovered this may have been a grisly crime in pursuit of a suspected buried treasure. This discovery kicked off a years-long investigation that spanned sting operations, an international search, a prison break captured on cellphone, and a courtroom showdown between lead prosecutor Matt Murphy and the man authorities believed was pulling the strings in a twisted game of greed and violence — Hossein Nayeri. Set during the early days of medical marijuana, Wicked Game: Devil in the Desert is a gripping three-part docuseries told through intimate access inside the case and to those who lived the story unlike any other. The docuseries showcases rare evidence stills, body cam and dash cam videos of gripping key moments, recorded police interviews with the victims and suspects, and features new interviews with the lead prosecutor and deputy counsel and the lead detective on the case. The series also incorporates \"20/20\"'s groundbreaking past reporting on the case, including archival interviews with victims and Nayeri, the so-called mastermind himself. ",
