  "overview": "It's not easy being a cop. Théo Luther is a formidable policeman. Yet after months of tracking down a child killer, he loses his footing, suffers from depression, and puts his marriage in jeopardy. Reinstated in his unit but closely watched, Théo must fight his personal demons more than the criminals. His first investigation: a young woman whom he suspects of the murder of her parents. But he is unable to prove his guilt. Worse, she even seems to taunt him. ",
