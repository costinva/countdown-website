  "overview": "For as long as he can remember, Eua has dreamt of becoming The Chef Master champion. A truly talented chef, Eua has worked tirelessly to make his dream come true. But no matter how much work he puts in, no matter how good his dishes are, he always seems to come in second. Convinced there's something important out there that he just keeps missing, Eua is determined to figure out what that \"something\" is. Completely wrapped up in his quest to find that missing piece, Eua loses focus on his work and it shows. Turning his attention elsewhere, Eua's cooking stagnates, his skills losing their finely honed edge. With his professional career slowly falling apart around him, Eua is on the verge of giving up; but everything changes the day Ake walks into his life. An ordinary delivery boy with an extraordinary talent, Ake brings with him everything Eua needs to succeed and more. Inspired by his newfound friend, Eua rises up to the challenges before him, happy to have Ake by his side. But even with Ake beside him, will Eua be able to overcome the obstacles that stand between him and his dreams?Adapted from the novel, \"Grab a Bite\" by Sammon, Bite Me is a 2021 romantic drama directed by David Bigander.",
