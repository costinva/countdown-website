  "overview": "Endo Kiyomi is a single mother living in a town at the foot of Mt. Fuji in Yamanashi Prefecture. She works at a business hotel. One day, she happens to meet an alien. If she was a pure-hearted girl, she would probably try to develop a friendship with the alien and fight against injustice in the world, but she's a little different. As an adult, she has experienced good and bad in the world. She asks the alien to solve minor events at her work or in her personal life without upsetting the alien.",
