  "overview": "In this ten episode docu-series, cameras will follow the stress and drama of five couples and their families as they prepare to tie the knot... or not. Throughout the weeks leading up to their nuptials, these couples will battle their families, friends and each other to work out all the details of their \"big day\". Whether the drama is about smoke machines and lasers at the reception or signing a last minute prenuptial agreement, these couples will stop at nothing to throw the most \"friggin\" over-the-top party of their lives - but at what cost to their relationships?",
