  "overview": "The new daily series, Drága örökösök, gives a glimpse into the lives of a family with whom the world is turning big because of a sudden legacy. According to the story, after the death of a village grandfather, it turns out that the old man left a huge fortune to his three children and two adult grandchildren who had already been separated from rural life and lived in the capital. However, the 612 million forints can only belong to the heirs if they undertake to move back to their native village, Ökörapáti, for a year. Another condition is that after the relocation, the relatives in Budapest cannot leave the small village for more than 12 hours for a full year. Whoever breaks this is left out of the inheritance, and if none of them succeeds in fulfilling the conditions, the vast fortune passes to the villagers.",
