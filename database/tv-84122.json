  "overview": "Millionaire blogger Olga Malinovskaya and her equally media-minded husband David suddenly find themselves not in trends, but in the countryside, under house arrest, without Internet, but with tracking bracelets. But here there is no Wi-Fi or vibe: instead of likes, there are luli from fellow villagers, instead of content — shoots, bulls and tractors. The plan: to escape to Belarus, and then to Mexico. Reality: injuries, current, gas and bull Borka. While the subscribers are bored, the investigator sets an ultimatum: if the locals write positive characteristics, we will return to the apartment. But how do you get a \"like\" from Uncle Smith if you stole his Internet connection through an extension cord at night?",
