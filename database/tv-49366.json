  "overview": "Brilliant inventor Robert Sommerby is head of a research establishment engaged in a very special secret project: the development of robots. Far from the crude, lumbering, steel-clawed automatons of sci-fi films, Robert's robots are humanoid in appearance and ultra-sophisticated in design, with highly developed electronic brains, fast reflexes and smooth, natural movement. Naturally, there are personality clashes; Eric is Robert's most advanced robot, who thinks humans are quite disgusting with their revolting habits like eating, while K.T. (aka Katie) is big, strong, and very stupid - he has a tendency to walk right through doors and is generally kept away from guests.",
