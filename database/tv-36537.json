  "overview": "Fill up the gas tank, because it's time to hit the road. We asked America to bring us their rides to answer the age-old question, \"What's my car worth?\" in Sticker Shock. From dad's old pickup to souped up hot rods, this series has it all, and host Dennis Pittsenbarger and our team of expert appraisers are ready to uncover their value. Whether it's a clunker or a classic, what it's worth may shock you. From cars you've always wanted, to cars you've never heard of, including Keller Super Chief, Blue Ray III, and Starcraft Starcruiser, Dennis, along with professional appraisers Randy Carlson, Addison Brown, Nick Smith and Todd Wertman, investigate their history and condition to determine a price tag you won't see coming.Cars are more than a set of wheels to get from point A to point B - they are members of the family. Aside from determining appraised values, Sticker Shock unveils the history and memories of these unique rides and automobile memorabilia. From cross-country vacations to circling Indianapolis Motor Speedway, each car has its own story, and this series is here to tell them.",
