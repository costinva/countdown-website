  "overview": "It always starts when Bart Peeters puts his children to bed, and they have a question about Sinterklaas. He then starts to tell and the viewers see where he has been and what he experienced. The experiences at Sinterklaas and Zwarte Piet are very diverse. It sometimes happens that Sinterklaas sleepwalks in the middle of the night, or does Sinterklaas always keep his miter on, even in the bath? Has Santa Claus ever been in love?",
