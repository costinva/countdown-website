  "overview": "On the banks of the Loire, in Châteauvallon, lives the rich and powerful Berg family. At La Commanderie, their property, we celebrate the double anniversary of the patriarch, Antonin, and his newspaper La Dépêche Républicaine. The party also marks the return of Florence, the cursed girl, whom her father would like to see take up the torch. The next day, the corpse of journalist Paul Bossis is found in the park. The latter was investigating the questionable real estate transaction in Les Sablons. André Travers, also a journalist and friend of Paul's, decides to carry out his own investigation. Secrets, lies and betrayals soon emerge. At the same time, the Kovalic clan, Yugoslav emigrants led by Gregor and Albertas, are trying to impose themselves in the city and aspire to dethrone the Bergs, with whom they have a heavy dispute.",
