  "overview": "We all dream of possessing a part of that quaint small-town life. A friendly smile and wave from the neighbors as the kids run through the yards playing ball. Unfortunately, sometimes even paradise is visited by loss. Heartland Homicide tells the stories of these events, when big city crimes visit small-town America. Each episode uncovers the lives and circumstances of the victims while outlining and examining the convicted individual's motives, bringing the horrific events into the light with the people who were there.",
