  "overview": "Nora is a night driver for a ride sharing company. Addicted to amphetamines, her life is falling apart: she is drowning in debts, divorced, and she's now sleeping in her car to save enough money to rent an apartment and obtain joint custody of her daughter. When her brother Ben (also a driver) crashes his car, Nora offers to deliver a strange package for him and ends up being generously paid. Without realizing it, Nora is now bound to a mysterious and dangerous underground network. Tonight will be the darkest night of her life.Â ",
