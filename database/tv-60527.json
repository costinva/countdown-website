  "overview": "In Loot, billionaire Molly Novak has a dream life, complete with private jets, a sprawling mansion and a gigayacht — anything her heart desires. But when her husband of 20 years betrays her, she spirals publicly, becoming fuel for tabloid fodder. She's reaching rock bottom when she learns, to her surprise, that she has a charity foundation run by the no-nonsense Sofia Salinas, who pleads with Molly to stop generating bad press. With her devoted assistant Nicholas by her side, and with the help of Sofia and team — including mild-mannered accountant Arthur and her optimistic, pop-culture-loving cousin Howard — Molly embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Giving back to others might be what she needs to get back to herself.",
