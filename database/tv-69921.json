  "overview": "\"This is historic — literally.\"At least, that's what a digital Michael Cera says at the start of the trailer for Steven Soderbergh's upcoming sci-fi comedy series, \"Command Z.\" The \"Ocean's 11″-through-\"13\" director has rounded up Cera, Roy Wood Jr., Chloe Radcliffe and Liev Schreiber for a post-apocalyptic look back at the year 2023, as they traverse into the past by putting a wormhole in a washing machine.\"Here's the funny part. Traversing our wormhole involves ingesting a synthetic substance related to psychedelics and playing the theme song from the movie ‘Mahogany,'\" says the Ozian Cera. He leads Wood Jr., Radcliffe and Schreiber on a series of missions, hacking into the brains of people from 2023 to alter their thoughts and undo history, which in this universe in includes the NRA teaming with police unions and an Amazon-Walmart merger allowing for blood as payment.\" ",
