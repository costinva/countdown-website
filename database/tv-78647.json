  "overview": "The crazy girl involved in an affair with a married man? Drinking, smoking and taking pills? Partying with her friend Wronka? Talking to her cat? Arguing with her eternally dissatisfied mother? Klara who has no husband, children or dog? Klara who can't sleep, Klara, who is many years old and has little time, Klara, who is a little afraid but has great courage to live, Klara, for whom love is more important than reason, and good sex is more important than a good name? Klara's Great Return!\"",
