  "overview": "The heroes of the program \"Leave Your Parents\" are adult children who, for various reasons, have not yet acquired their own housing and are forced to share their life with their parents. Some of them returned to their parents' home after a divorce or due to financial constraints, while others simply delayed \"flying out\" of the nest. Professional realtors, psychologists, designers and even astrologers communicate with the show's heroes and help them find suitable housing and finally start an independent life.",
