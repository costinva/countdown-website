  "overview": "When a killer wants you dead, there's one place to search: home sweet home. With the twist of a lock, your home should be your sanctuary. For some, it becomes a hunting ground. No lock, security system, or call to 911 will save these victims. These are stories of relentless, cold-blooded murderers who know their target intimately, understand their routines, and have a perfect knowledge of the home in which they will kill. Armed with this knowledge, they are able to plan the perfect murder, hide their tracks and nearly get away with murder.",
