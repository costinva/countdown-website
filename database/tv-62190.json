  "overview": "Buy It or Build It stars Dallas-based twin brothers and contractors Chris and Calvin LaMont as they help clients decide whether to renovate an existing home to fit their lifestyle or build a new home that is completely customized to their needs. Based on each clients' budget, Chris finds properties with potential and shares how he'll use the budget to give the home a fresh look, while Calvin wows them with designs of a newly built home at the same price point. Once clients decide whether to buy or build, the siblings and business partners deliver the perfect dream home for each family.",
