  "overview": "The Orient Express: A Golden Era of Travel – a 4 x 60' series set to launch on More4 in September – will take viewers on the epic 1,700-mile journey from London to Istanbul. The series will travel along the route and stop at key cities and towns including Munich, Salzburg, Vienna, Budapest and Sofia – exploring how they each played an exciting role in passengers' journeys on the Orient Express.  In its golden era, the train was a second home for celebrities, politicians, monarchs and spies – as well as a notable inspiration for author, Agatha Christie – and the series will explore the history of the route and chart how Europe has changed since the Orient Express launched in 1883. As well as the glory days of the past, the series examines how war and political upheaval shaped and impacted the cross-country train service that connected countries across the continent for decades.  Comparing then and now, The Orient Express: A Golden Era of Travel will also feature the inaugural run of Golden Eagle's luxury train service from Paris to Istanbul – highlighting how the lavish rail travel pioneered by the Orient Express in the 19th and 20th centuries continues to this day. ",
