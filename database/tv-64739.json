But when heiress and estranged middle daughter Zhongyu returns from Singapore to stake her claim in her father's business empire, her sisters Zhongling and Zhongxiu join in, each with their own prerogative. As the siblings clash over business, love, and family, the Sino-Japanese war steadily unfolds, transforming their way of life. Devastating, yet ultimately optimistic, this family drama follows the sisters as they work together to keep the business afloat and their lives intact amidst the turmoil of war.",
