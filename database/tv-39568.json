  "overview": "TLC summons viewers to tune into its new series Mama Medium, a psychic experience unlike any other, featuring Jennie Marie, a doting wife and mother with a larger-than-life personality, who is gifted with the extraordinary ability to talk to the dead. Not only is she a medium, psychic, and fourth generation clairvoyant, but she also has an uncanny gift of connecting with people who are otherwise incapable of communicating for themselves. Throughout the series, Jennie Marie bridges the gap for people who are desperate to communicate with their loved ones, whether they've transitioned to the afterlife or suffered a life-altering incident. Every episode will showcase several readings, offering viewers a first-hand look at Jennie Marie's unique ability to connect with people on a deeper, more spiritual level.",
