  "overview": "When the gubernatorial front-runner is shot in the street, the reporters of Frente Tijuana race to cover the story, but the facts they uncover run much deeper than the assassinationâ€”insidious corruption has been allowed to grow in the shadows. Violence and intrigue become the norm for Borja's team of journalists as they risk their lives in their crusade to expose the truth.",
