  "overview": "Real Life with Lucy follows \"self-confessed nosiest woman in Ireland\", Lucy Kennedy, on a deep dive into the diverse lives of young Irish people. From identity theft to romance fraud, Lucy explores how young people are falling victim to the increasingly sophisticated and murky world of scams. She spends time with young addicts recovering from substance abuse and discovers just how accessible drugs now are. With so much noise around sports, schools and bathrooms, Lucy takes an unfiltered look at what life is really like for the transgender community in Ireland. With equal measures of scepticism and obsessive belief, Lucy embarks on an other-worldly experience, as she meets psychics, mediums and witches.",
