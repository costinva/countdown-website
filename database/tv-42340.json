  "overview": "Inside the Supermarket follow Sainsbury's colleagues from the boardroom to the shop floor and across the country. From one of Sainsbury's biggest supermarkets - Hedge End in Southampton, which has over 600 employees - to the Sainsbury's London headquarters, known as the Store Support Centre office, to its busiest northern depot at Haydock Park, Merseyside, which delivers 1.4 million crates of produce to stores every week, the series gives a multi-dimensional portrayal of the supermarket which this year marks its 150th birthday.Â Cameras will join a Sainsbury's team as they scour Britain for the next big food product, hunting down small suppliers who could see their fortunes transformed if Sainsbury's backs their product; as well as a fashion graduate who, during her first year out of university, launches her clothing collection to the supermarket's customers.",
