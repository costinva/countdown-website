  "overview": "Based on the novel of the same name by Yulian Simonov (author of Stierlitz from \"Seventeen Moments of Spring\"). A dismembered body is found in the forest in 1979 Magadan, eastern Soviet Russia. The way the body was cut and hidden seems similar to a similar event that happened years ago near the end of WW2-Europe.",
