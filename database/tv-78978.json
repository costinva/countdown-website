  "overview": "Charming secular adventurer Sasha escapes from Moscow to Krasnaya Polyana, where she is attracted by the proximity of the sea and mountains, palm trees and snow, ambitious majors and reckless adventurers. In an attempt to settle in a new place and profit from relaxed vacationers, she immediately falls into the clutches of the head of the resort's security service, Mikhalych. To preserve her freedom, Sasha is forced to make friends with the hotel and casino staff and, becoming one of them, figure out the insidious blackmailers who force the manager to dance to their tune. She ran away from some problems in order to run into even bigger ones and eventually make the main choice of her life: freedom and financial independence or love and friends she never had.",
