  "overview": "These criminal cases thundered throughout the Soviet Union. Novels were written and feature films based on them. Their figurants are millionaires of the socialist era, cunning thieves, professional robbers and currency dealers. They challenged Soviet society. The best detectives in the country accepted the challenge. They did not have computers, cell phones and riot policemen at their disposal. But this did not interfere with the administration of justice. The Black Cat gang, the case of the gang of Soviet gangsters of the late 60s , nicknamed the Fantomas, the fascinating story of the raider Leonid Panteleev, the \"free artist-robber\" - these cases went down in the history of Russian forensic science.But the main goal of the series is not just to tell about the crimes and malefactors of the Soviet era, but to show the bygone era so that young viewers can feel the spirit of the bygone times, and older viewers can feel nostalgia for the past.The presenter is the Honored Artist of Russia Leonid Kanevsky, the legendary Major Tomin from the popular TV series \"Experts are leading the investigation.\"",
