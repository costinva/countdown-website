  "overview": "In Superoppusserne we meet eight families who for various reasons have an impractical and dysfunctional home that does not meet their needs. They dream of a better home. Our team, led by interior designer Linda Steen, moves in with extreme professional weight and takes the problems seriously. For a week, they lift a home, room by room, until the lives of the owners have changed and they have a good and functional home.",
