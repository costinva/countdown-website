  "overview": "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? That's the question on the lips of Graham Norton as he searches for a new Maria Von Trapp for the forthcoming West End production of The Sound of Music. The brainchild of legendary impressario and composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? sets out on the unenviable task of trying to fill the wimple of Julie Andrews. Who could possibly be a nun in training, a governess, a will-o'-the wisp and a singing sensation? Later this year Andrew Lloyd Webber and theatre producer David Ian' launch a new production of The Sound of Music. But in a twist, rather than pick their new leading lady themselves, they've decided to let you, the viewer, decide.",
