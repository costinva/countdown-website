  "overview": "A day before the start of a full-scale invasion, a young conductor receives a marriage proposal from the train master, but the beauty sees her future in a completely different way. But the war destroys all her plans. Polina's train becomes an evacuation train: instructions and timetables are in disarray, three times as many frightened and nervous passengers are crammed into the cars, there is a lack of water, food and medicine, a ruthless enemy is shooting from everywhere, and even the driver does not know the end point of the route. In addition, the scoundrel thief tries not only to make a small profit from human misery, but also to steal museum valuables that are being evacuated on the same flight.",
