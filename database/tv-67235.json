  "overview": "Scrublands is set in isolated country town Riversend brought to its knees by endless drought, where a charismatic and dedicated young priest calmly opens fire on his congregation, killing five parishioners. A year later, investigative journalist Martin Scarsden arrives to write what should be a simple feature story on the anniversary of the tragedy but when his instincts kick in and he digs beneath the surface, the previously accepted narrative begins to fall apart and he finds himself in a life and death race to uncover the truth. ",
