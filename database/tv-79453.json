  "overview": "The first field deployment of Lieutenant Tul, a rookie officer assigned to the Criminal Investigation Department, unexpectedly brings her face-to-face with Dr. Cherran, a physician from the Institute of Forensic Sciences. Their differing work attitudes create a considerable gap between them, making it challenging to find common ground. Amidst the crime scenes reflecting societal issues, Detective Tul also contends with pressures from a working system favouring influential groups. She navigates the interference aimed at protecting allies and the societal currents that could influence the case's outcome. At least Tul's integrity remains intact amidst these challenges. When she teams up with forensic doctor Cherran, they methodically analyze the evidence left at crime scenes, leading them closer to identifying the perpetrators in each case. With time, both Tul and Cherran grow to trust each other more, working tirelessly to protect the lives of the innocent and ultimately deliver justice to the families of the victims.",
