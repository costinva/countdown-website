  "overview": "Fist of Fun started life as a BBC Radio One series in 1993, written by comedians Stewart Lee and Richard Herring. After the station moved away from the half hour comedy format, the show was commissioned as a television series, which began on BBC 2 in early 1995. Fist of Fun went out at 9pm on Thursday nights and was an immediate success.",
