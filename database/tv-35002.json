  "overview": "Popular stars will find out what people think about them. They will have to listen to jokes about their personal lives, creativity, careers, and appearance. The star guests will be \"roasted\" by aspiring stand-up comedians — they are hungry, angry, and therefore have nothing to lose! The host is Comedy Club resident and stand-up comedian Ilya Sobolev. Each episode features a special guest — a colleague or friend of the \"victim\" with the same star status, who will touch on really sensitive topics and personal conflicts. At the end of the show, the star has the right to respond in order to take revenge for his \"roasting\" in a tough and funny way.",
