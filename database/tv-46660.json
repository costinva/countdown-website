He is an ex motorcycle champion, wild and determined to take back the reins of his life. She refuses to conform her life to the masses and dreams of flying far away, but she knows she is the glue that holds her family together. Their love will blossom as the first umbrellas open on the beach and grow strong and vibrant with the summer sun. For both, these holidays will be an unforgettable journey that will take them far from who they were before they met.",
