Be it budding feelings for his ex Berthe, the constant best buddy advances of her new lover Jan or an urgent series episode - Paul always has an excuse ready.But luckily there is half-sister Barbie, a determined top manager with significantly more balls in her pants, and half-brother Ludwig, a lifer who avoids work like the devil avoids holy water.
