  "overview": "A piece of bluestone beside the Tianhe River in the fairy world. Because of hearing the nine books of the heavenly book chanted by immortals in the world, he was able to get rid of the stone body and cultivate into a fairy womb. The bluestone, which had just turned into a human form, accidentally walked away a sky demon, and was convicted into the turbid world, and the patrolling immortal was also removed from the immortal class. Before falling into reincarnation, the two met for a hundred generations. In a blink of an eye, it is the last life of a hundred reincarnation after a thousand years. The birth of Xianxian caused a dispute between righteous and evil people and demons.",
