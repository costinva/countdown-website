  "overview": "Softball Bases Loaded provides whip-around coverage taking the viewer to the best action across NCAA Softball Regional sites. Originating from ESPN's Charlotte, N.C. studios, Bases Loaded will provide live look-ins to multiple games, allowing fans to watch key moments, clutch plays, high-pressure situations as they unfold in real time throughout the weekend. With action originating from 16 different sites in North America, the communication among everyone working on the telecast is vital. Bases Loaded is similar to ESPN's Goal Line (for college football) and Buzzer Beater (for college basketball) services. Bases Loaded has been utilized during the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship the last two years and Baron Miller will rely on his experience producing that telecast heading into the weekend.\"Ultimately we are focused on putting the best action on our air at all times throughout the entire weekend,\" continued Miller, who will share coordinating producer duties with Desmond Wallace. \"We will be smart with our telecast — have [anchors] Matt [Schick] and Brendan [Fitzgerald] provide context to the viewer why this game/out/batter/etc. is important. Context is important…but action is king.\"",
