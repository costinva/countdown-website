  "overview": "Stéphanie leads an ordinary life with her daughters in a village in the Haute Côte-Nord. Returning from a yoga retreat, she is surprised to be welcomed by her extended network, who have come to cheer her up. But this retreat was more of a getaway to the South with her lover... An accomplice to this lie, her best friend Cynthia saw fit to reinforce its credibility by telling anyone who would listen that Stéphanie is depressed.",
