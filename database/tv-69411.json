  "overview": "See It Loud: The History of Black Television celebrates the achievements of Black actors and creators, examining the historical impact Black culture has on all culture. Today we are in the midst of what is being widely referred to as \"The Golden Age of Black Television;\" however, this \"Golden Age\" is the culmination of an eighty-year struggle for Black artists to find a voice and fight for representation, beginning in the 1950s with Amos n' Andy, which was the first series to feature Black characters. This series takes viewers on a journey from Black television's origins in sitcoms like The Jeffersons to blockbuster dramas like Roots, explores the emerging opportunities for Black voices in sci-fi and horror, and examines the cultural impact of the reality and unscripted genre on Black culture. Each episode in this five-part series explores the impact of these stories not only on their creators but on the audiences watching them, forging connections and building communities of shared experience. See It Loud explores the vast history of Black television through iconic performances across various genres, including sitcoms, comedy, drama, unscripted, variety, and science fiction.",
