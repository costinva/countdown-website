  "overview": "In\n 2011 a team from the University of Basel made two astonishing \ndiscoveries in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. By chance they came across a\n new tomb that was the first to contain a body since the discovery of \nTutankhamun. Then they discovered that the tomb beside it, which had \nnever been excavated before, held the bodies of around 50 people. But \nwho were all the people in these two linked tombs? This film follows the\n archaeological detective story to uncover the answer. It pursues the \ntrail that leads to one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs, Amenhotep III - \nand to the women he was close to. And the film also reveals the \nastonishing project behind the re-emergence nearby of the largest temple\n ever built in ancient Egypt - the lost mortuary temple of the same \npharaoh, Amenhotep III.",
