  "overview": "We know Luther in Penoza as tough and loyal to the bone, but how did he actually become that taciturn killer? We meet Luther in the present, where in the underworld he not only tries to take revenge on his brother's murderer, but where he also grapples with the demons of his past. At the same time, we get to know the young talk-maker Luther from the 90s who, full of bravado, ends up in the booming hash trade. He has to fight harder and harder to survive in a drug world that is increasingly hardening.",
