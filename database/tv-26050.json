  "overview": "Rockland Ranch is a community unlike any other. In the middle of the Utah desert 14 fundamentalist Mormon families have made a unique home for themselves, a safe haven where they are free to practise a way of life that's met with both fascination and suspicion. Living in contemporary 'cave' houses that have been carved into the side of an enormous sandstone rock, half of the men here are polygamists, with multiple wives. With unprecedented access to this unique community, this series offers an intimate and revealing insight into the everyday lives of modern polygamous families. With narratives as rich as any drama, the series explores how the families navigate both the practical and emotional challenges of plural marriage and examines the values and beliefs that lie behind it.",
