  "overview": "Since childhood, David can count on Cam and Flo, his best friends. Between work, evenings, love stories, ass, family and tunes problems, he confides his galleys and joys to them over a drink and a cup of too salty peanuts. Always at the same bar. Always at the same table. And always... \"On The Terrace\".",
