  "overview": "Spanning the red earth of the Top End to the green pastures of regional Victoria, it showcases five passionate graziers from across Australia, each of whom has been given a Kelpie puppy from the same litter to train up to be a muster dog. It is an action-packed yet intimate character journey through the lives of the graziers as they participate in a unique experiment; to transform a greenhorn pup into an efficient working member of a mustering team, all in 12 months!",
