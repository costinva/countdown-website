  "overview": "Stand up (or rather sit down) comedy accompanied by traditional sketches orchestrated by Irish comedian Dave Allen and his assembled group of actors. The show was very popular in the UK in the 1970s and was exported to the US where it became a minor success after being shown intermittently on American public television or as late-night filler on the local networks.",
