  "overview": "Coping with his loss of faith, a young priest has his world turned upside-down when he witnesses the resurrection of an immortal being named Divine. Given sanctuary by the church, Divine leads a never-ending crusade to show lost souls they have the power to choose their destiny between good and evil. With guidance from the priest's mentor and Divine's street-smart sidekick, the Father must now confront his own demons and the dark forces that challenge Divine. Telling you anymore would spoil the surprises that await you.",
