  "overview": "Black. White. examines race with an extraordinary approach by putting new faces on the Sparks family, an African-American family, and the Wurgel family, a Caucasian family. Through the transformative power of make-up, the Wurgel family--Carmen Wurgel, her daughter Rose Bloomfield, and Carmen's longtime boyfriend Bruno Marcotulli--become black, and the Sparks family--Brian, Renee and Nick--become white. The two families shared a home in Tarzana, California for the duration of the six-week production. Cameras followed each family member as they went about their daily routines throughout Southern California.",
