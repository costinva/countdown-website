  "overview": "Sarah Beeny visits twenty households to experience their problem spaces for herself before installing cameras to monitor exactly how they use their homes. Having collated the data, she generates life-size floor plans that bring all her design, layout and decor ideas to life. She follows each build over the following months and revisits each household's amazing completed project to prove that if you re-think and re- design the space you already have, it is better to renovate not relocate.",
