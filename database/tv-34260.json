  "overview": "How to Stay Married goes behind the closed doors of a two-point four family who are stuck in a rut. Greg and Em have been married for 14 years, but their relationship is lacking spark. Life gets complicated when Em goes back to work for the first time since the kids were born, just as Greg is made redundant.A funny, honest, warts-and-all take on parenting, careers and partnerships in 2018, How to Stay Married tackles the big issues modern day marriages face, from managing screentime, to date night expectations and what actually constitutes hard-rubbish.A spin-off from \"It's a Date\".",
