  "overview": "The series dives into Checo's intimacy during the races leading up to the Mexican Grand Prix. A unique, personal and exclusive access to his training and preparation. He was never this close to winning the award at home. We will be immediate witnesses of an epic and personal moment that can culminate in Checo's tears when he hears the Mexican anthem playing on the \"Hermanos Rodr√≠guez\" circuit.",
