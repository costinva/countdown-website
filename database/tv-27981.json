  "overview": "After the death of Alondra's mother, her father Baldomero, who feels sad and lonely, brings his sister Loreta and her two kids, Maria Elisa and Rigoberto to live in his house, hoping that Loreta will replace a mother to Alondra. But he is mistaken. Loreta hates Alondra, as she reminds her of Alondra's mother who used to be an actress and whom Baldomero's family never accepted. Years go by, and Alondra grows up into a beautiful, rebellious girl, with very independent and progressive views for that time.",
