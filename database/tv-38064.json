  "overview": "When Hope Calls tells the story of sisters Lillian and Grace who open an orphanage in the 1916 Western town of Brookfield. Caught between the traditions of cattle ranchers and the ambitions of a growing town, they strive to find romance and happiness while overcoming the challenges of helping the children in their care. Throughout their journey, they discover community, acceptance and love as they create the family they always longed to have. Familiar faces from Hope Valley, including Rosemary and Leland Coulter and Mountie Nathan Grant will be visiting Brookfield throughout the season.",
