  "overview": "Australia is the oldest, flattest, driest inhabited continent on Earth. It's a vast landscape, shaped by epic forces that--over 180 million years--have divided it into two worlds: an arid interior covering 70% of the terrain, and a lush haven of mountain ranges spanning the entire eastern coast. Occupying this land of extremes are some of the most unique and resilient creatures on the planet, marsupials, mammals, and insects that have evolved and adapted to thrive inside Australia's arid heart and along its Great Dividing Range.",
