  "overview": "Jean-Claude Van Damme aka 'The Muscles from Brussels' is a massive box office star with roles in movies including Bloodsport, Universal Soldier and The Expendables 2. In Jean-Claude Van Damme: Behind Closed Doors his private life is exposed for the first time as he allows cameras access behind the scenes at his home and when he's at work on set. Van Damme and his family reveal the man behind the movie legend who works and parties hard. We discover a sensitive but complex character who is strong enough to take on the world, but who also regrets his rock 'n' roll lifestyle and desperately misses his family when he is away filming. This is an intimate portrait of an international movie star as you've never seen him before.",
