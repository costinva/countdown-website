  "overview": "422 rue Sauv√© has been abandoned for years. The owners are said to have gone in search of their missing daughter and never returned. That doesn't stop Lou and his friends from making it their hideout, despite the mysterious door with 100 padlocks in the basement. What is it for ? Is it to protect us or - to protect what is hidden there?",
