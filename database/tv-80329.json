  "overview": "\"Naydi po ID\" is a real Internet investigation using the latest technology. Can you trust a distant relative who has reconnected with you after a long break? What to do if you have fallen in love with an online acquaintance, but she does not want to see you? Where to go if someone has stolen your candid photos and threatens to post them on the Internet? The host Nikolai Leibov has one answer to these and other questions - to figure out the secret ill-wisher and find out what the interlocutor on the other side of the screen is really up to.",
