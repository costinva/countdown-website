  "overview": "Enlightens the value of true love through 4 young minds. In their 20's, full of life but with an uncertain future. Then come the 30's, self hypnotized to the acceptance of world as it means stability. 4 people representing the 20's and the 30's search for true love in their coincidental meetings and sometimes deny their fate. They realize the humble truth that true love is acceptance of each other not ownership and that love is the only hope in this age of despair.",
