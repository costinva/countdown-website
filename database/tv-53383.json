  "overview": "The Cube challenges players with what appear to be simple tasks all to be completed in — you guessed it — a 4m x 4m x 4m perspex cube.The games may sound simple, like bouncing a ball into a bucket within a timeframe, but once the clock starts counting down everything becomes a little bit more tense. Add to that the promise of $250,000 in prize money and you'll be setting up your own practice Cube at home.\"Things get tense with me and my mates when we play skill games to determine who's going to get the next round of beers at the pub,\" The Cube Australia's host Andy Lee said. \"Imagine doing it for a quarter of a million dollars. I can't wait!\"Andy's no stranger to doing deceptively simple tasks under pressure so who better to guide Aussies through a series of ridiculous but also edge-of-your-seat tense tasks.",
