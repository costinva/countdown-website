  "overview": "Budding metropolitan investigator Oleg Khlebnikov deliberately kills a criminal during detention. He is sure that for those who have done something terrible, prison is too lenient a punishment. But the deceased turns out to be a media person, and in order to hush up the scandal, his death is called an accident, and Khlebnikov is temporarily exiled to serve in a remote town in the taiga. Marginals and scoundrels disappear here, but locals prefer not to notice it — there are fewer problems. Khlebnikov undertakes investigations and discovers the trail of a serial killer who always leaves St. John's wort flowers at the crime scene. Oleg will have to figure out who is behind this and decide which side he is on.",
