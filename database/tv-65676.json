  "overview": "An original and dramatic series that views the most violent and significant episodes in modern history from a fresh perspective â€“ not as two world wars, but as a continuous narrative of error, ambition, revolution and courage. An expert re-examination of history forms links and conclusions that tie the entire war period together and, with the benefit of hindsight, pieces together how the world went and stayed at war for so much of the 20th century.",
