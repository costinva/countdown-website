  "overview": "Phil accidentally learns from the director of the hypermarket the number of the winning bottle, which will help to get the main prize of the lottery — a car. Without thinking twice, the guy gets a job in the store as a seller, but provokes the fall of a huge rack, so now he has to work out the damage. The hypermarket becomes a place of detention for him, where passions flare up behind closed doors with the participation of the deputy director, the warehouse manager, the loader, Phil's boss and other employees.",
