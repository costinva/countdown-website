  "overview": "Blasting a Port-a-Potty 100 feet in the air using sugar powered rockets? Constructing home-made night vision goggles that actually work? Pulling off foolproof bar bets backed by scientific theory? This isn't science, It's Effin' Science, G4's newest, original series with one goal in mind; hack science to do, build and create the kind of stuff that viewers have always wanted, wish they'd invented or didn't know they needed. Each episode is jam-packed with experiments, practical jokes and sure-fire bets - all created and proven through science. Hosted by comedians Angie Greenup and Marc Horowitz and engineer Chad Zdenek, the series sets out to explore the weird, wild and off-beat side of science.",
