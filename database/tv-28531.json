  "overview": "Australian-produced comedy Kinne is a feisty mix of sketches, rapid fire one-liners and man-on-the-street pearls of wisdom from stand-up comedian, internet favourite and occasional landscape gardener, Troy Kinne. Joined by an ensemble cast of mates with nothing better to do, Kinne skewers the little things in life with his straight-up and left-field take on the world.",
