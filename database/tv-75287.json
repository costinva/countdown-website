  "overview": "7500 miles long, 1000 feet deep, stretching from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia, the Gulf of Maine is a 36,000 square mile underwater Eden whose abundance drove the development of colonies, states and a nation, changed the way we lived. Today, this treasure is in peril. Warming faster than 97% of the global ocean, what happens here will likely happen everywhere. This is far more than a story of peril â€“ it's also a story of remarkable biodiversity and adaptation. Over three episodes, we meet scientists, fishers, native Americans and innovators working to help the Gulf bounce back. A three-part NOVA special presentation premiering July 24, 2024 at 10 pm on PBS.",
