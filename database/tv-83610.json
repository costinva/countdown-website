  "overview": "Teacher Olga Golubeva gets hooked by scammers and now owes the bank three million. Her husband Vadim's plan to sell the village house is not working. Then Golubev's son Zhorik offers to create a farm, but not to grow vegetables, but money. After all, a village with cheap electricity is an ideal place for mining. All that remains is to hide this idea from the collectors, the village chairman and the school principal.",
