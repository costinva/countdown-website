  "overview": "The series follows British naturalist and explorer Steve Backshall showing us what it takes to be a beekeeper when he becomes an apiarist for the first time, as well as exploring the importance of the 270 different bee species in Britain, showcasing the marvels of their societies; examining the importance of their existence through history; and delving into the science and cutting edge research being conducted into these fascinating creatures.   Without bees and other pollinators our food security would be seriously compromised – they are vital to the well-being of the UK and the planet.   ",
