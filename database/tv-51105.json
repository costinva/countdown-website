  "overview": "Edgar Pascoe is a cardiac surgeon of high repute but sclerotic emotions. He is here to represent the cold detachment of modern technological medicine, a theme underlined by his participation in a scheme to market virtual-reality diagnosis to third- world countries (you don't even have to be in the same country as the patient, you see). Opposed to him is his wife, Lileth, a believer in the curative powers of empathy and communication.Â ",
