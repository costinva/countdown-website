  "overview": "Dr. Salvador Pereyra has returned from a 10-year journey to the Middle East with a mind-blowing discovery: the tomb of Marduk, creator of the concept of God and whose teachings gave rise to the world's religions. But when his work is plagiarized by a dangerous sect, it's up to Salvador and a young sci-fi writer to stop the cult before it can spread.",
