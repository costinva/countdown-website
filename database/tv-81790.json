  "overview": "The Anfield Wrap travelled to Glatten, Frankfurt, Mainz, Dortmund and around Liverpool to hear unique stories from the German's journey, told by those who know him best. The five part docu-series explores five recurring themes throughout Jürgen's story — challenge, Blueprint, journey, winning and legacy — and features footballers that played with and under him, friends that stood by his side through thick and thin, colleagues that helped him move to the next level and the fans that gave him their undying support throughout.",
