  "overview": "A schoolboy Gleb can get into a large esports team, but his parents are against his hobby and insist that his son get a more traditional profession. To appease mom and dad, Gleb enters a second-rate college, hoping that he will be able to devote a lot of time to training. He does not yet know that soon a new headmistress will appear in the institution — a young Moscow IT specialist Alice. She has big plans: to raise the prestige of the college and thus give a boost to her career. This may hinder Gleb, but he decides to fight all the obstacles on the way to success in esports.",
