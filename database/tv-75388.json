  "overview": "Who is a master at solving riddles? Detectives of the Secret Life agency! Every now and then they encounter something unusual: an invisible thief, a mystical cheese factory, a killer gift for a fitness blogger, an assassination attempt on Napoleon - a modern one, of course. The main characters are detectives Volodya and Sasha, and two ambitious girls help them. Katya and Zhenya are sure that they can handle any mystery on their own, so they often come into conflict with the guys. This confrontation between male and female not only helps in investigations, but also adds intrigue to the characters' relationships.",
