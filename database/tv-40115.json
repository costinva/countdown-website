  "overview": "Intelligence is a workplace comedy set in the UK's GCHQâ€”a kind of weedier, geekier version of MI5, where they tackle international and domestic Cyber Crime from a desktop. But when a pompous, maverick NSA agent comes over from the U.S. to join the team, he enlists an inept and tactless computer analyst in a power grab that threatens to disrupt the team's ability to combat cyber terrorism.",
