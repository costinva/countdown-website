The heroine's husband, a successful businessman Dmitry, dies in an accident.Now Vera is a widow. She has to cope with difficulties herself, manage the business and support her mother-in-law. But troubles never come alone - it turns out that her deceased husband had a mistress, Yulia, and she is pregnant! Moreover, her mother-in-law, whom Vera treats like a mother, suddenly begins to take care of Yulia and eventually declares that she will not abandon her grandson - after all, he is \"the only blood relative in this world.\"It is strange, but it is in these far from rosy circumstances that the heroine begins her path to true female happiness.",
