  "overview": "Washington the fox, Sam the wild boar and Eugenie, Sam's little sister, are tired of living paw-to-mouth in the wilderness. They crave the creature comforts only the suburbs can provide and decide to zip into costume and disguise themselves as run-of-the-mill house pets. So far, their secret is safe but you can count on the gang's wild animal instincts to surface at the very worst moments, driving the gags and suspense!They've tamed their new household, but they're not out of the woods just yet.",
