  "overview": "Former policeman Ivan meets his sworn enemy in the courtroom, who killed his partner six years ago and then sent him to jail. Togo is once again accused of contract murder, but the dodgy criminal is released again. All these years spent in prison, the thirst for revenge devours Ivan from the inside. But, embarking on the path of revenge, he encounters very dangerous and influential people. Now he is forced to make a deal \"with the devil\": in order to save his own life, he must fulfill an \"order\" for them. Ivan gives his consent and becomes a hired killer - a killer. But fate makes its own adjustments to his plans: Ivan gets into a terrible accident. For several weeks, doctors fight for his life, the main character survives, but loses his memory: he does not remember who he is, who hired him and whom he must kill. He does not remember anything and thus gets an unexpected chance at a new life.",
