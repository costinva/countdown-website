  "overview": "Inspired by Masaba Gupta's story, the series gives you a sneak peek into the contrasting lives she lives -- from the fancy dos she attends with her celebrity friends to moments she is crying into a bottle of wine on the floor of her apartment, Masaba is as real as it gets. Masaba Masaba is a celebration of her life, successes and failures alikes, packing in a ton of fun, laughter and tongue-in-cheek humour that is synonymous with her and her actor mother, Neena Gupta.",
