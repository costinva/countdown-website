  "overview": "On May 30, 2005, 18-year-old Natalee Holloway disappeared on the island of Aruba. Her case resulted in a world-wide media frenzy, yet Natalee's body was never found, and her father, Dave Holloway, has never stopped searching for answers. Now, 12 years later, he's following what he believes to be the most credible lead to date: a detailed first-hand account from a man who claims to know the whereabouts of his daughter's remains, and the hope of finally getting a conviction of Joran van der Sloot. Viewers will follow Dave and T.J. Ward, the family's longtime private investigator, in the latest and perhaps final chapter of the decade-long pursuit to uncover what really happened to Natalee.",
