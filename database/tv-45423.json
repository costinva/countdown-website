  "overview": "The Ghost Bride is set in 1890s Colonial Malacca. Li Lan has been offered a marriage proposal from the wealthy Lim Family to become the \"ghost bride\" to their recently deceased son. Her family will be saved from a lifetime of debt, but she'll spend the rest of her life being haunted by the Lim family's son. Desperate to get out of this ghastly arrangement, she soon finds herself wrapped up in a murder mystery and embroiled in other-worldly affairs much bigger than she could have ever imagined.",
