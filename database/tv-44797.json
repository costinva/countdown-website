  "overview": "In the new Durf Te Vragen, Siska Schoeters invites a group of people to each episode that we secretly have a lot of questions about, but we don't dare to ask ourselves in their faces.\"Do you buy your clothes in the children's store?\" Ask someone with dwarfism; \"Have you ever considered going into therapy?\" To people who love BDSM; or \"That celibacy, shouldn't that be abolished?\" to a priest: Siska collected these and many other interesting, funny but also daring questions from the general public.The answers from the group are always honest and frank and provide a surprising, sometimes witty, sometimes confronting look into their world, dreams and fears. As an advocate of direct questions, Siska himself delves deeper into the story of some witnesses. She goes out with them for a day and asks additional questions in her own direct way, in order to better understand them.",
