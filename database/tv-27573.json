  "overview": "Documentary series revealing nature's fascinating animal behaviors using cutting-edge modern technology. Many nature's events happen in ways much faster or slower, lighter or darker, larger or smaller than can be appreciated with the naked eye. Using cutting-edge modern technology to manipulate time, light and size, the series reveals the daily struggles of both predators and prey in their ongoing fight for survival in the American Southwest; the unique behaviors of some of the rainforest's elusive animals and insects of Central America; and the hidden lives of Africa's wildlife in ways invisible to the naked eye.",
