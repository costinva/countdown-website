  "overview": "Full Metal Junkies follows the everyday goings on at Shred and Butta, an upcycling car yard with a difference. Whether it's testing the possibility of creating a caravan suspended in the sky, so you never miss out on a stunning view, or simply taking your best friend's car (while he's out on a job), cutting the roof off before installing a hot tub and hoping that not only will he not mind, he'll actually like it, this series is fun and entertaining as well as full of clever ideas to turn a vehicle into something entirely different to its original purpose!",
