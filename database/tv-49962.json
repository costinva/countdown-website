  "overview": "Jungle follows the connected lives of several strangers, each facing their own struggle, viewed through the prism of UK rap and drill music, and gives a perspective on an often-unseen world. Frequently misunderstood, it's a world where one law governs everything: only the strongest will survive. As the strangers' worlds begin to unravel around them, they come to the realization that every action, no matter how small, has a consequence.Â ",
