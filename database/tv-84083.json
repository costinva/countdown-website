  "overview": "Sheds light on the most significant moments in the history of Finland's sexual and gender minorities as well as today's reality without embellishment, but with warmth. The series tells the history of numerous Finns, which has never been told without voyeurism and exoticization. The events of past years are mirrored in today's reality through historical experiencers and today's queer icons.",
