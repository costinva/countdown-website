  "overview": "WondLa centers around Eva, a curious, enthusiastic and spirited teenager being raised in a state-of-the-art underground bunker by Muthr, a robot caretaker. On her 16th birthday, an attack on Eva's bunker forces her onto the Earth's surface, which is now inhabited by aliens and covered with otherworldly fauna, and there are no other humans to be found. In fact, it's no longer called Earth, but Orbona. Otto, a lovable giant waterbear with whom Eva shares telepathic powers and Rovender, a cantankerous alien with a troubled past, join Eva as she leads the team on a dangerous quest to find humans, her home and her true destiny.",
