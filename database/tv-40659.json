  "overview": "Elder Skelter tells shocking stories of senior citizens who committed cold, calculated crimes. Did they suffer from dementia, or had they spent a lifetime suppressing their sick fantasies before it all came to a head? After building reputations as model citizens, loving family members, and contributors to society, these oldies but no-longer-goodies cracked in their final years only to spend the rest of their retirement in prison. Celebrated fashionistas often featured in the popular blog, Advanced Style, Lynn Dell Cohen, Joyce Carpati, and Rita Ellis Hammer, host the series guiding viewers through each story, often imparting their own age-old wisdom and advice.",
