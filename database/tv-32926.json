  "overview": "If you had one shot at a clean break, a chance to turn your life around, to make a fortune and secure a new life, a better life for you and your family, would you take it? And if so, just how far would you be willing to go?One night in the office, hidden in plain sight, Sam overhears an illegal trade being made; the initial shock giving way to the realisation she has direct access to highly confidential financial information. Inside information, which could afford her the break she so desperately needs. With her life in free-fall, Sam has everything and nothing to lose. Armed only with a copy of Trading for Dummies and a gamblers nerve, this ordinary devoted and loving Mum makes a few tentative steps into the dark, dangerous and illegal world of insider trading, but just how far is she willing to go to turn her fortunes around?",
