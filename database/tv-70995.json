  "overview": "Three students of an online school — Nikita, Vika, and Riley — want to break into the world of great art. Nikita is a natural leader, Vika is a talented designer and coder, and Riley is a brilliant artist. But Nikita is in too much of a hurry and doesn't listen to her friends, Vika is preparing for exams and can hardly find time for creativity, and Riley is afraid to show her paintings because of online bullying. To become a real team, prove themselves, and not quarrel, they will have to overcome their inner demons and understand what is truly important to them.",
