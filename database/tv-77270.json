  "overview": "Chopper Cops showcases Marion County Sheriff's Department's secret weapon: state-of-the-art helicopters manned by elite police pilots. Known as Air One, these chopper cops, who operate 24 hours a day and seven days a week, are equipped with high-tech infrared cameras and augmented-reality mapping capabilities that allow police on the ground to see in the dark and locate the bad guys. As Sheriff Billy Woods' \"eye in the sky,\" they detect where perpetrators are running and hiding and whether they're armed; they essentially guide the SWAT team with vital, instantaneous information that could separate life from death.",
