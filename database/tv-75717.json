  "overview": "A kid-based sketch comedy, aimed at 9-16 year olds. It was a national spinoff of the already popular local show You Can't Do That on Television (YCDTOTV), which had debuted a few months earlier. Whatever Turns You On (WTYO) featured seven of the 22 kids used on the first season of YCDTOTV and was shot on the same sets. Essentially they were the same show, only WTYO had comedy and musical guests, and YCDTOTV had those plus local, call-in features, and local contests.",
