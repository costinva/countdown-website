  "overview": "Violent Earth with Liev Schreiber explores the unbelievable science behind epic natural events. This jaw-dropping five-part series examines increasingly frequent and harrowing climate events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, volcano eruptions, tsunamis, and wildfires. It features incredible footage of the most intense examples of these weather events and new interviews with the scientists, storm chasers, and survivors who lived through them. This series is an in-depth examination of our natural world and its changing climate. Are these storms, fires, and earthquakes more powerful now, and are they happening more frequently? Is there a connection between these disturbances and climate change? In each episode, scientists and meteorologists explain the science behind these deadly natural occurrences, how they form, where they happen, and what to do if you find yourself trapped in one of these situations.",
