  "overview": "A modern drama series, Fantasy Island takes place at a luxury resort, where literally any fantasy requested by guests is fulfilled, although they rarely turn out as expected. The resort is run by Elena Roarke, who set aside her own ambitions — and even the love of her life — to uphold her family's legacy. Sophisticated, insightful and always charming, Elena's calm exterior masks the challenges of the responsibilities she has assumed as steward of this mysterious island. Delving into the \"what if\" questions -- both big and small -- that keep us awake at night, each episode will tell emotional, provocative stories about people who arrive with dreams and desires and depart enlightened and transformed through the magical realism of Fantasy Island.",
