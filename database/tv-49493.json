  "overview": "Two Film Institute graduates turned wedding photographers travel to Manali to cover a Punjabi friend's wedding at a resort. One of them inadvertently captures a cold blooded murder by the groom's father. He is horrified to see the killing being nonchalantly swept under the carpet, and in trying to do the right thing, he ends up risking all of their lives. At the same time, a police inspector from West Bengal lands up in Manali investigating another murder, adding an unexpected twist to the story, making things even more complicated for the two families and the resort owner.",
