  "overview": "Liaisons is a modern dramedy, telling the story of the affairs and relations within a family and beyond; the ongoing search for love and the various ways of getting it today. The series follows the love life of one famous architect with impeccable reputation (Mika, 43), her husband - former coroner, and a marriage counselor now (Tony, 48), and their family. Its numerous members are being tingled in complicated affairs, which consistently add dirty secrets and embarrassing stains to the biography of the \"perfect\" family. The grounds are seriously endangered. Could Mika and Tony manage to stay together, or will they indulge to the temptations, which skulk from the outer world?",
