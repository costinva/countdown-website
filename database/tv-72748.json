  "overview": "\"Witnesses\" is a documentary series created from interviews that the War Archive team has been collecting since 2022. These are the stories of five brave residents of settlements north of Kyiv (Moshchun, Yasnohorodka, Borodyanka) who survived the Russian occupation but never stopped resisting. Delivering humanitarian aid, rescuing our soldiers from encirclement, providing medical care, cooking for soldiers or just for cats - all these are big and small personal feats that inspire and give us strength to continue the fight.",
