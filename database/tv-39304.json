  "overview": "It revolves around the crimes and secrets of one of Mexico's most influential families, of how a humble young man jumps across social barriers to climb up the economic and political ladder, and about the raising of awareness of a young heir struggling to clarify the murder of his father, in a Mexico very much like today's, but far from being the same.",
