  "overview": "Social Media Murders brings together three films airing over consecutive nights, each focusing on a shocking real crime that resulted in the death of a young person. Linking each of the films is the unsettling role social media played in bringing together the culprit and the victim. Providing a compelling yet cautionary insight into the experiences of young people affected by disturbing 21st century crime, these three films put the victim at the centre of the narrative alongside material obtained from social media accounts and mobile phones which will immerse viewers in the events as they unfolded. ",
