  "overview": "After death, Vitya and Borya get a chance to move on, waking up every day in the bodies of strangers. A mysterious mechanism calculates the deeds done during their lifetime and suggests that they correct the \"moral balance\" by giving them the opportunity to be reborn in order to correct karma with a \"good deed.\" They live like in a computer game, where every completed task is a plus or minus to their new karma.",
