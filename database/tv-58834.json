  "overview": "The Casta√±edas and Montiels are two rival families of wine merchants. Their lives are as entwined for good or bad as the vines they so passionately care for. The old harmony ends when Crisanto's eldest son and heir, Emilio, dies in a car accident caused by Paco's heir, Juanjo Montiel. The family loss brings out the worse in Crisanto, who decides to sue his lifelong friend and declare war on him and his kin.",
