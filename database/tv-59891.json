  "overview": "For the first time in its history, a camera crew has exclusive access to the extremely tough selection process for new members, which lasts for more than 7 months. Hundreds of applicants start and only a few will end up passing the tests necessary to become GEO members. In each chapter the progress of this group of aspirants will be followed, delving into their personal history, their reactions to harsh trials and their transformation through a process that will put their physical and mental capacities to the limit. Subjected to extreme stress, deprived of sleep and exposed to unbearable conditions, applicants will have to overcome their worst fears to be prepared for what may lie ahead.",
