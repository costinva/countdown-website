  "overview": "Frontierswoman Sayward Luckett's struggles in Ohio during the late 18th-century and early 19th-century. A new look at how the West was won. Â Adapted from the trilogy of novels by Conrad Richter, \"The Awakening Land\" spans 27 years of frontier settlement. It begins in 1790, when the dirt-poor Lucketts leave Pennsylvania in search of game in the Ohio Territory. The head of the clan, Worth Luckett (Tony Mockus), is a good provider but also a wanderer, so it's not long before his oldest daughter Sayward (Elizabeth Montgomery) is looking after her three sisters.",
