  "overview": "The Bougon are a family of modern-day rebels! Crazy, dirty, vulgar, dishonest, grumpy, uneducated... but united, happy and endearing, the Bougon are the kings of the \"Systeme D\". A counter-model to our society, they have made a religion out of resourcefulness, and their favorite pastime is finding the flaws in a system that has rejected them.",
