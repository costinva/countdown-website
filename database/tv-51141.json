  "overview": "This animated sitcom follows the adventures of a boy from the city named Peter and his imaginary friend Wolf, a visitor from a parallel universe populated by beings from fairy tales and legends. Wolf can use any ordinary wardrobe to travel between worlds and bring these fictional characters into our lives. He often assists them in dealing with amusing problems, teaming up with Peter, who knows his way around modern gadgets, devices and technology. This series is an archetypal story about children with imaginary friends (\"Karlsson-on-the-Roof,\" \"Peter Pan,\" \"Monster Inc.,\" etc.). Age-old motifs found in Russian fairy tales are presented in modern dress. Adults will delight in the humor every bit as much as children do.",
