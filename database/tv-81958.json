  "overview": "Gerard Joling and Gordon stay and work three days with a family, club or company. These are places that are totally different from their everyday lives. The two \"divas\" do not know in advance where they are going. Frequently they fail to perform tasks assigned. The program is based on the format that formed the basis for the series The Simple Life with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, that looks like the comedy TV series Green Acres.",
