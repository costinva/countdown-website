The British Empire controlled over a quarter of the earth's land, the Royal Family struggled to rebrand itself in order to save the monarchy, and Winston Churchill boosted morale and resolve in the nation's deepest moment of need. Using cutting-edge digital technology, witness the dramatic stories of kings, queens, colonists, and a maverick prime minister, presented entirely in color.",
