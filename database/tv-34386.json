  "overview": "The new season of the popular TNT show \"Intuition\" received the prefix SUPER, 12 star participants and a 3-million prize fund. Here you do not need to have encyclopedic knowledge. There will be no point in calling your friends with the last name Druz or Wasserman. Here you do not even need to answer faster than others. In front of the main character of the program are 12 strangers. To win, you just need to guess which of them is an extreme snowboarder, and which is a violinist from the philharmonic, which of them had sex with five women at once, and which has five Ferraris in the garage. Previously, single players competed for the prize in the show. Now 4 teams of TNT stars are entering the fight for the prize fund of 3,000,000 rubles.",
