  "overview": "Featuring an enormous interactive bridge that dares players to cross by stepping on the right answers to challenging trivia questions. Each step forward puts money in the team's bank, with bonus money for each successful crossing. However, the team gets to keep the money only if it can \"beat the bridge\" by returning one of its players back across before time expires in an exciting end game.",
