  "overview": "Traces the birth and the course of works of international significance or of major stories of European heritage, the original manuscript of which has come down to us. Privileged witness to the encounter between the author, the emotion and the idea, the evocative force of the manuscript makes it a very coveted object: sometimes offered, stolen, hidden, it is often sold, lost and then found ... In a world that is increasingly dematerialized every day, these unique objects look like wonders.",
