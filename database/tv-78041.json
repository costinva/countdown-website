  "overview": "Three sisters, Ira, Olya and Masha, have long dreamed of leaving Nizhny Novgorod for Moscow. Each sister has her own moving scenario, but they all secretly rely on the financial help of her mother, the owner of Tatiana's jewelry business. However, Tatiana has other plans for life: as a souvenir from her vacation, she brings a massage therapist 20 years younger than herself. And while the whole town is gossiping about a sudden romance, the daughters suspect that the new family member is an ordinary conman. They intend to open Tatiana's eyes to the truth, but does a woman who just wants to be happy need her?",
