  "overview": "There's a new force to be reckoned with on the dance floor and his name says it all! Todd Sharp is the coach of the University of Louisville Dance Team, the Ladybirds, and he's driven, precise and over-the-top. The team has over 15 national championships under their belt and with this year's nationals fast approaching, Todd will push the ladies to another victory, even if it kills him. More than just a drill sergeant, these elite athletes count on Todd to be their guidance counselor, surrogate father and the \"head-bitch-in-charge\" who ultimately makes them shine on So Sharp.",
