  "overview": "Top cowboys from across the United States compete to win a herd of cattle, a coveted belt buckle and a lifetime of bragging rights. As they lock horns in a series of grueling challenges, they are judged on their skills, knowledge, grit, and passion. The male and female contestants include ranch owners, ranch managers, ranch hands, horse trainers, and rodeo stars. One by one, the cowboys who don't perform are eliminated by host Trace Adkins and a panel of expert judges. In the end, only one cowboy rides away with the herd.",
