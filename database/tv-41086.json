  "overview": "Meet the people at the heart of Glasgow's Central Station - the busiest railway station in Scotland - that has been part of the city's lifeblood for 140 years. Cameras followed the train drivers, maintenance workers, station staff, transport police and customer service assistants during the heatwave summer of 2018 to look at what makes the station tick, keeping more than 950 trains a day running, carrying more than 32 million passengers a year. Staff are pushed to the limit by the heat and Storm Hector causing havoc on the tracks, and have to work around the clock to deal with disruptions and delays, football fans and big music events.",
