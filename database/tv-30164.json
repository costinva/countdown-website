  "overview": "Picture a retirement complex where the residents party like it's Spring Break, every day! In its newest reality series, WE tv pulls back the curtain on a group of outgoing, party-loving men and women who are all over 60 years old and living \"La Vida Loca\" in Surprise Arizona's Sun City, one of the country's largest retirement communities. From an ex-nun who skydives for fun, to a widow ready to break onto the dating scene with the help of her boozy flock of friends, the residents of Sun City are out to truly live the life they have left. Sunset Daze captures this Disneyland for the retirement set, where there are no jobs or children to get in the way of having fun.",
