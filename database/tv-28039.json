  "overview": "When philosophy scholar Jack Griffin loses out on his dream job and goes to work as a high school Advanced Placement Biology teacher, he makes one thing very clear: he will not be teaching biology. Realizing he has a room full of honor roll students at his disposal, Jack uses his flawed logic to misdirect his principal and recruit the kids to help him mentally break his job-stealing nemesis and win back the position that's rightfully his.",
