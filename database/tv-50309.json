  "overview": "Two families go head to head as they try to name the most popular answer to survey-based questions posed to 100 people, with a chance to win a £30,000 jackpot prize. The new Family Fortunes keeps the classic features of the original we all know and love with the families playing for the chance to win single, double and of course, ‘big money' through the game play, as well as the added bonus of winning additional prizes along the way.",
