  "overview": "Six fairly cocky Paris police academy-graduated newbies join the metropolitan police, to be trained on the job by arrogant veterans who constantly bicker amongst themselves. KÃ©vin Laporte is a closet-gay. Macho Alex Moreno comes from a slum family. Ambitious, academically gifted Lyes Beloumi is of Maghrebinian origin. Shy Nadia Poulain is a young mother in a shaky marriage and Haughty Laura Maurier has a complex family-relationship with captain Franchard.",
