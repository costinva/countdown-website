  "overview": "Houses of Horror: Secrets of College Greek Life exposes the dark side of Greek Row and its impact on some of the young men and women who participate. Each one-hour episode features first-hand accounts of how the power, control, and secrecy of fraternities and sororities can create a cult-like dynamic leading to an environment where nefarious activity - from drug use to sexual assault--is able to thrive. Through exclusive sit-down interviews with those involved including former fraternity and sorority members, family, law enforcement and experts, the series details how these organizations that seemingly offer acceptance and community for young people have far-reaching consequences that can turn dangerous, and even deadly.",
