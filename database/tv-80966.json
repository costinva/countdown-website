  "overview": "Logre, the famous ogre who reigns over the magical creatures of the kingdom of Logres, takes a very dim view of the quest for the Grail in which Arthur has embarked. He therefore decides to set up a machine to reduce the powers of Merlin, the famous enchanter. Odilon, an archer of the King, learns of the stratagem. Helped by Alan the bard, he will do everything to thwart the plans of the King of Brocéliande. On their way, they will meet a series of colorful characters like Blööm and Pace, two elves trying to cover up the crime of a knight of the Round Table that they have committed; as well as Ferrigno and Zif, an orc and a goblin, soldiers of the army of Logre.",
