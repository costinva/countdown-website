  "overview": "Alphablocks: Word Magic is a series of 26 short episodes published all at the same time on BBC iPlayer in 2020. Each and every episode will begin with the letter doing something, with the narrator describing it. After that, three words will be spelled with that letter, and a little scene will play that has something to do with that word. After the words, the same Alphablock animation will play a second time. There are 26 episodes, one for each letter in the alphabet.",
