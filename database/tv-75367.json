  "overview": "Khun Nueng, M.L. Sipakorn, is a beautiful woman who's grown up under pressure from her grandmother. She's never been allowed to be herself, never met someone she could feel loved by or worthy of. Then she meets Anueng, cheerful and bright. Beneath the smiling face, however, there's a sadness hidden in her eyes. She makes her heart flutter like never before. Unfortunately, the sixteen years age difference, family and societal norms keep their love from flourishing.",
