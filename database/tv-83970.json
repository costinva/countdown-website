  "overview": "In a blood-soaked encounter at a banquet, the Chu siblings are ruthlessly pulled into the whirlpool of fate. His right arm stained with blood, her tears falling onto old wounds, a fleeting kiss like a sudden bloomâ€”brief yet unforgettable. However, the chains of ethics force them apart, and the flames of war ultimately separate them. A year later, Jiang Yichen uses an engagement as his weapon, closing in step by step, vowing to utterly destroy the Chu family. Yet, even the powerful are not immune to temptation! The young military commander willingly submits to her, kneeling beneath her cheongsam, ready to serve her. Meanwhile, a false brother betrays the ethical bonds that once held them, tearing apart all moral boundaries. The forbidden sparks of a love triangle between him and Jiang Yichen ignite, throwing their relationships into chaotic turmoil. She struggles in a web of conspiracy, her hairpin stained with blood and her white gown torn. Stumbling into his arms on a cold night, every step she takes is heavy with hardship, yet the abyss of fate has already opened. As hidden truths are revealed, bloodline lies, enemy communications, and foreign plots push all three toward the edge of life and death. Their destinies are already intertwined, and escape is impossible.",
