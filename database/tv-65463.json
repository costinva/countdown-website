  "overview": "Zhao Nuan Nuan is a comic book artist with outstanding drawing skills who has always dreamed of becoming the best in China, but has repeatedly failed. Hopeless, she is forced to go on a blind date, but mistakes a passing Gu Yi Chen whom she was supposed to meet on a blind date. Zhao Nuan Nuan's only drawback is that she is very unlucky, but ironically, she accidentally discovers that while she is getting closer to Gu And Chen, her luck is changing for the better. In order to change her twenty years of bad luck, Nuan Nuan did not hesitate to disguise herself as a man to apply for a permanent job as a cleaner in CEO Gu Yi Chen's office to get her luck, not knowing that Gu Yi Chen suffers from an unprecedented \"allergy to touching the opposite sex\".",
