How long can Third love Kai silently while watching Kai bring a different girl home every night? Third has tried to see Kai as just a friend. But has failed time and time again. Because as easy as it is to fall in love, to stop is just as hard. Maybe even harder. That is until Third learns a secret that breaks his heart completely. But when Third decides to stop, Kai decides to start.",
