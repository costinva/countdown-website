  "overview": "Transatlantic, set in 1940-1941 Marseille, is inspired by the true story of Varian Fry, Mary Jayne Gold and the Emergency Rescue Committee, and Julie Orringer's 2019 novel, The Flight Portfolio. Risking their lives to help more than 2000 refugees escape occupied France, including many artists on the Nazis' most-wanted list, an international gang of young superheroes and their famous charges occupy a villa at the edge of the city, where the threat of mortal danger gives way to unexpected collaborations and intense love affairs.",
