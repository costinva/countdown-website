  "overview": "Office worker Kiyoshi Adachi has gone 30 years of life without ever having his cherry popped. Due to this profound accomplishment, he becomes a wizard with the ability to read minds through physical contact. However, he thinks his newly attained skill is hopelessly lame and has caused him to dislike crowded places.On the way to his work, Adachi runs into his attractive and well-liked coworker, Yuuichi Kurosawa. Piqued by his personality, he furtively touches Kurosawa and takes a peek at his heart, only to find out that the man holds romantic dreams for a colleague at their office. Adachi attempts to connect the dots, but soon, Kurosawa's fantasies are laid bareâ€”his coworker's perverted thoughts are meant for him! Despite doing his best to concentrate, he can now hardly remain focused with Kurosawa around.",
