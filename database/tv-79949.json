  "overview": "Project 7 is an 'assembly, strengthening' audition program that breaks away from the audition format in which viewers mainly participated by voting, directly selecting participants for each round from the first round, forming a new team, and growing their favorite participants through the process. It is a differentiated new concept idol audition program that introduces the concept of \"Project 7\", a new concept idol assembly reinforcement audition scheduled to be aired on JTBC in October, is open to all 'men who dream of becoming top-tier idols' without restrictions on affiliation, experience, age, nationality, etc.",
