But at the heart of this fight, his daughter, Agnès, pushed by her lover, the sulphurous lawyer Maurice Agnelet, sells her shares in the family casino to Jean-Dominique Fratoni. A few months later, she mysteriously disappears. A forty-year fight begins until the truth about his disappearance comes to light! ",
