  "overview": "Based on a rigorous journalistic investigation into three femicides that took place between March and April 2022 in the state of Nuevo Le√≥n, in northern Mexico, the documentary series #Todas Debanhi: Una historia de redes offers an insider's view into two different types of networks: on the one hand, a network of complicity that allows violence against women to persist and, on the other hand, a network of resistance formed by family members and feminist activists to demand justice.",
