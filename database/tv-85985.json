  "overview": "Khemjira is a young man who can see ghosts. He was born into a family cursed such that every male must die before the age of 21. As the spirits around him grow increasingly aggressive, the protective amulet he has worn his whole life begins to lose its power. Unable to bear seeing Khem in danger, Jettana, his friend from university, takes him to a rural village in the Northeast, where they meet Pharan, a revered teacher of ancient magic who once mentored Jettana. Strange and mysterious events unfold, all connected to the past life. Amid these supernatural encounters and the haunting pursuit of revengeful spirits, a deep emotional connection begins to form between Khem and Pharan.",
