  "overview": "Gu Nan Ting is the somewhat haughty and arrogant deputy head of the passenger flight department at the leading Chinese airline Louzhou Air. He is an outstanding pilot with a strong sense of self-discipline. But he is also known as a strict and uncompromising individual. That makes things somewhat awkward when his superiors tell him that the airline will undergo a restructuring process.This means that he must take charge of training and mentoring young would-be pilots – ensuring that they are ready to begin flying commercial routes. This puts him on a collision course with Cheng Xiao, a young female civil aviation pilot who is determined to become a commercial pilot. Gu Nan Ting initially doesn't think that she has what it takes to become a Louzhou Air pilot – mainly because she is somewhat unruly. But as they begin to work together, this duo is soon forced to share the same cockpit on commercial routes. When the pressure begins to mount, they will soon be put to the test – and forced to work together in high-stakes scenarios! Original Network: CCTV, iQiyi,Tencent Video, JSTV",
