  "overview": "Unemployment is rising, debt is exploding, and we are waiting for the return of growth as we are waiting for the messiah ... desperately. The Grande Nation sold its factories to the Indians, its castles to the Russian oligarchs, its football teams to the emirs, its vineyards to the Chinese. And to top it off, the President of what remains of the fifth world economic power disappears! Amandine Barzati, Prime Minister, seizes control of the Constitutional Council and then designates the president of the Senate to ensure the interim. And here is how Alphonse Dumoulin, retired professor of history, becomes the President of the Republic.",
