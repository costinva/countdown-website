  "overview": "Relationships can be intoxicatingâ€¦ with an emphasis on toxic. For some men, the women in their lives are like a drug they just can't quit, even if the high lands them behind bars for decades to come. Whether it's their mothers, sisters, lovers or a close friend, men have robbed for acceptance, killed to avenge and kidnapped to make a special lady happy. For My Woman is a true crime series that features the salacious and shocking stories of men, and a handful of women, who have been arrested for a crime they did in the name of loyalty. From a three-state killing spree, to a mortuary that becomes a house of horrors, and from murdering a cheating spouse, to a string of robberies to keep their love in finery, these individuals have no limits as to how far they'll go for the women in their lives.",
