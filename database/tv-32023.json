  "overview": "Kiki Mobile is a fast-paced talk-variety show is on the move…literally! It's the only talk show on wheels and comic Kiki Melendez (creator of Hot Tamales Live) is the host and driving force behind this unique, first-of-its-kind show. Just like any other talk show, Kiki will perform an opening monologue, interact with the audience, interview celebs and influencers, banter with her handsome band leader, feature man-on-the-street interviews, and present sizzling performances from top (and up-and-coming) music acts. But what sets Kiki apart from other talk shows is that she is the only talk show host that goes to wherever the celebrity is—on set, at home, the spa, Whole Foods, wherever! That's right! Kiki, her sexy RV driver, and the luxuriously tricked out Kiki Mobile will come to you! Of course, there's always an adventure along the way and every celebrity, newsmaker, and extraordinary ordinary person that Kiki interviews will have the ride of their lives.",
