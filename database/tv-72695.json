  "overview": "Soccer star Fodé Thiam goes off the rails in front of the cameras, calling his coach a \"dirty toubab\" (white in Wolof). Caught up in the media storm, the club calls on Sam Berger, a talented communicator, to manage the crisis. But her rival, Marie Kinsky, was not to be counted out, as she instrumentalized the event by fanning the flames of the identity and social rifts dividing the country. The fever never stops rising.",
