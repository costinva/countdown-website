  "overview": "VICELAND brings the endlessly creative, critically acclaimed and comedic Detroit hip-hop force Danny Brown to the channel in a psychedelic slumber party of a show. Danny's House brings the cozy energy of Mister Rogers and the unpredictability of Eric Andre to a comedy-talk-variety show like no other. Celebrity guests are invited to hang out in the basement (and mind) of Brown. No one comes out the same.",
