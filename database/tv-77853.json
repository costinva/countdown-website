  "overview": "Yuki Tanaka is a VTuber at Live-On, one of Japan's largest VTuber companies, as the polite and ladylike Awayuki Kokorone. One day, she forgets to end the stream, and viewers see her real personalityâ€”irreverent, improper, and prone to imbibing after a long day. Yuki is surprised to find that her accident caused her rankings to multiply, so she doubles down and gets to work. She'll be a star yet!",
