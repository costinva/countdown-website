  "overview": "TG4's Travel series Téacs Taistil is back for its third season. This fun, quirky, and slightly chaotic adventure show has gone from strength to strength—kicking off with an epic first season, levelling up in season two, and now bringing you what we think is the best one yet.Every week, our three young, totally unique presenters are thrown headfirst into a mystery trip with just one mission: to show us—rain-soaked Irish people—where we should go and what we could do if we hopped on a plane, train, or automobile for a three-day adventure.With zero time to think, our travellers—Louise Cantillon, Séaghan Ó Súilleabháin, and Proinsias Ó Cuinn—get just 24 hours to pack, wax, and leg it to an unknown destination.From chasing the Northern Lights in Iceland to roaming the ancient walled city of Split, or even just braving the rickety roads of Cavan, our three highly competitive presenters have to throw themselves into the local way of life—all while waiting for their next set of text instructions.Where they stay, what they do, and how they eat? That's all decided by a mysterious texter. Over the past two seasons, they've steered boats across straits, shorn sheep on highlands, and even chiselled their own leather sandals—because why not?But season three takes things up a notch! For the first time, the gang is leaving Europe and getting lost in the sights, sounds, and madness of North Africa. They'll hit the fairgrounds in Seville, take a walk in the clouds over Bratislava, and learn some traditional skills in West Cork.So what's in store this time? What Insta-worthy moment will Louise capture? What TikTok trend will Séaghan jump on? And will Proinsias finally get over his fear of chickens?Join the Lad's as they embark on this fun adventure, creating memories to last a lifetime!",
