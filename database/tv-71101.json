  "overview": "Ching Ka-ying and Koo Ching-king are lovers and Chinese medicine graduates. Ching-king chooses to continue with his medical studies, causing the couple to end their relationship. Ten years later, the duo run into each other again. Ka-ying has become a public Chinese medicine center service supervisor. Although Ching-king is a Doctor of Chinese Medicine, he works under Ka-ying as her subordinate as he could only apply for the position of CM trainee practitioner. Even though the duo often quarrel due to their different beliefs, they are benevolent medical practitioners hoping to use their medical knowledge and experience to help patients. Despite the fact that there are many restrictions placed on CM practitioners in the health care system, they jointly oversee a contingent of novice CM practitioners, including Lo Yuen-chi, Yuen Si-si, Tong Siu-kwong and Pang Ching-mong. Together they create what they regard as the ideal Chinese medicine center and boldly go down the road to benevolence.",
