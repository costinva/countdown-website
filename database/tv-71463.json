  "overview": "Explorer, adventurer and self-professed zoology-nut Max Djenohan has spent countless months in the world's wildest places trying to perfect his survival skills. This series follows Max as he embeds himself alongside both the majestic superstars and the unsung heroes of the animal kingdom to tap into their survival secrets. In each episode Max learns valuable lessons from large species like lions, gorillas and crocodiles as well as smaller creatures like ants, owls and mudskippers. In survival lore, if you want to live a day in a new place, watch and learn from the animals already there. Whether he's finding food, shelter or water, Max tracks and studies his wild teachers to adapt their skills and put their tactics into practice.Â ",
