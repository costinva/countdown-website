  "overview": "1946 Lieutenant Denis Zhuravlev returns to civilian life and gets a job in the police. His boss - Major Shumeiko, nicknamed Satan - is a man with a difficult character, but he achieves the solution of the tasks at any cost. Zhuravlev appears in the team just in time: a gang of a criminal nicknamed Klesh is operating in the city, and in order to catch him, an extraordinary plan is needed, which Zhuravlev undertakes to implement. However, it soon becomes obvious that the war going on in peacetime, when it is not clear who is friend and who is enemy, is even more confusing than the war from which he has just returned.",
