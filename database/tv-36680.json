  "overview": "Most couples face great trials and tribulations over the course of their relationship. But imagine navigating life's great milestones - marriage, children, building a home - knowing that you identify as a different gender. And imagine what must go through a woman's mind when her husband finally builds up the courage to share with her this life-altering truth. TLC's new docu-series Lost in Transition profiles the deeply personal stories of four couples currently living through this reality, as they attempt to make sense of their new normal. Each hour-long episode will chronicle the lives of four couples during the most trying time in their marriages, delving into the confusion, disappointment and uncertainty surrounding them. In each relationship, the wife has recently found out that her husband has grappled with his gender identity for years and has made the brave decision to become the woman he is inside. Throughout the course of the show, viewers will witness each couple's journey as they share this news with family and friends, take steps toward the husband's transition and embrace their newly evolved relationships.",
