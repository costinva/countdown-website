  "overview": "The \"tiny house\" movement has spread from Britain to the US and now Australia as space-conscious folk downsize to homes as small as 10 square metres. Whether it's their home, holiday house, cute cottage, rural retreat or beloved beach shack, thousands are reaping the benefits of tiny living, enjoying quality of life at a fraction of the price. Yet the trick is to get as much of the charm and functionality of a big home into those tiny houses without compromising the \"tiny house\" spirit. Follow eight Australian couples as they search for the perfect tiny house in a new, locally made series Tiny House: Australia. Selling Houses Australia host Andrew Winter guides the couples over eight weeks as they consider three homes in each epiosde. Australia has some of the largest homes in the world – with an average of 243 square metres – so it will be fascinating to see what can be done with a fraction of the size and a \"little\" inspiration … as well as the ultimate choices our couples make. ",
