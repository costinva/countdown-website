  "overview": "The Vietnam War is one of the most controversial wars in United States history, and as battles were beamed into the nation's living rooms night after night, widespread protests led to a fundamental shift in America's national identity. Hundreds of film crews captured the action as it unfolded on the battlefield and now, through meticulous journalism, Vietnam: The War That Changed America tracks down the soldiers and civilians on all sides who lived through the war, bringing them together, often for the first time in almost half a century. Each episode features powerful reunions and the emotional stories told by those who faced agonizing life or death situations and impossible moral decisions. Across six episodes a picture also builds of the profound changes to America itself, and a very different country that emerged out of the war.",
