  "overview": "SAS: Catching the Criminals will take audiences on an immersive journey, and look at how police and enforcement teams are increasingly using military and SAS tactics to catch criminals.Theft, fly tipping, and environmental crimes are on the rise, with unsolved crimes seemingly going unpunished. Billy will travel across the UK, shadowing the forces using covert intelligence, surveillance and disruption to target anti-social crime around the country. He will follow multiple police forces, local councils and trading standards, to see what tactics they are applying to their investigations and honing their techniques and improving their skills to seek out the perpetrators and bring them to justice.Billy will also be speaking to victims of some of the crimes the programme is exposing, as well as meeting some of the local community who have helped solve cases. Each episode will also feature an elaborate sting operation, planned and executed by the teams that Billy follows.",
