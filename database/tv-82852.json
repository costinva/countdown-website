  "overview": "Mafia: Most Wanted offers audiences insight into the ‘Ndrangheta, a powerful Italian organized crime syndicate, and its deep roots in Canada, where its allegedly been involved in drug trafficking, theft, financial fraud, extortion, and murder. The series challenges the perception of the Mafia as an \"open secret,\" shedding light on the inner workings of a Toronto crime family, and the individuals behind the infamous names.Included in the docuseries are interviews with former mob enforcers Joe Ferraro and biker turned  police informant Cecil Kirby, plus crime writer James Dubro, investigative journalist Joseph Loiero, and retired RCMP sergeants Larry Tronstad and Brad Trainor. Their firsthand accounts, combined with undercover surveillance footage, wiretaps, police intelligence files, and dramatic recreations, paint a vivid and disturbing picture of the brutality of organized crime in Canada, and the devastating consequences of their actions.",
