  "overview": "In the Slovak Television's knowledge competition, hosted by Gregor Mare≈°, two opponents will compete, as is customary in duels. In three competition rounds, they have the opportunity to compare and turn their knowledge from various areas of life into money. An attractive novelty is undoubtedly the immediate handover of the entire financial prize to the winner at the end of the show. Of course, if he does not decide to continue playing and winning.",
