  "overview": "Born and raised on the Sea Islands of Charleston, South Carolina, cook and caterer Kardea Brown grew up in a big family with a love for food, especially the cherished recipes they passed down from generation to generation. She began cooking as a child in her grandmother's kitchen, where she learned to make the traditional dishes of the region. In Delicious Miss Brown, Kardea shares the family events, culture and recipes close to her heart - including Sunday supper after crabbing on the dock, a low country boil at the beach and shrimp boating to prepare for the ultimate Shrimp Fest.",
