  "overview": "Question Team is a show that sets out to re-write the panel show rulebook by making its players set the questions.In every episode Richard invites three comedians to join his Question Team. In a brazen act of indolence, Richard is outsourcing the lion's share of the preparation to his guests by demanding they each bring a unique round of questions, inspired by their own interests for him and the others to play.Richard's sole stipulation is that their questions have proper answers, otherwise what goes down during their game is entirely up to them.",
