  "overview": "For five years, HGTV superstars Ben and Erin Napier of Home Town have been using their heart, creativity, design and building skills to renovate, restore and uplift scores of historic homes and businesses in the small town of Laurel, Mississippi. Now, in the Home Town Takeover, it will take every hand and hammer as HGTV takes Ben and Erin's favorite phrase, \"make something good today,\" into the stratosphere with the whole-town makeover of Wetumpka, Alabama. The series will showcase 12 major renovations all over Wetumpka, including restaurants, shops, historic homes, public spaces, a new farmers' market—and even an entire downtown street—with the goal that the impact will ripple through the community for generations to come.",
