  "overview": "Welcome to Westeros Valley High, home to deception, scheming, and backstabbing - but without the beheadings (hopefully) - and the setting for a new parody Web series, School of Thrones.The online series, takes characters from Game of Thrones and puts them in a modern-day high school setting for a lighthearted YouTube production. Just like the George R.R. Martin novel series, characters including Theon Greyjoy, Stannis Baratheon, Rob Stark, and Daenerys Targaryen battle for the throne.. only this time it's for Prom King and Queen.Each of the houses in Game of Thrones has been translated to a high school clique for the Web series: The Baratheons are the jocks. The Greyjoys are loner water-polo players. The Stark siblings are hipsters.",
