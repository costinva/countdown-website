He has exposed neo-Nazi attacks against immigrants in Russia, illegal American weapons sales to Mexican drug cartels, the tobacco industry's exploitation of children in Asia, and children used to mine gold in deadly labor camps in Congo. In each case he has used declassified government documents and key sources to bring shocking and important stories to light. In Travel Channel's Mission Declassified, Putzel uses his investigative tools and instincts to explore some of history's most notorious and speculated-upon mysteries.",
