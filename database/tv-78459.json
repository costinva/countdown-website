  "overview": "On her wedding day with the Crown Prince, Li Chi, the daughter of the Xie family, Xie Wanyin, stumbled upon a cruel hunt: the ever-virtuous State Preceptor, Dongfang Zui, shot the Emperor's father-in-law to death, unflinchingly and with a smile on his face. The State Preceptor has targeted Xie Wanyin since then. Expectedly, Dongfang Zui's conspiracy leads to a shocking turn of events concerning her wedding with the Crown Prince. However, to Xie Wanyin's surprise, Dongfang Zui is not trying to get rid of her. Instead, threatening to harm the entire Xie family, he forces Xie Wanyin to become his wife. Everyone assumes the State Preceptor to be broad-minded. Only Xie Wanyin knows that he is nothing but a brutal, atrocious lunatic. Uncompromising and bold, she makes up her mind to kill this crazy man. On their wedding night, Xie Wanyin decides to execute the plan she has long prepared for. Unexpectedly, smiling brightly, Dongfang Zui looks at the dagger in Xie Wanyin's hands. He grabs her hands and puts the dagger into his heart. \"Dear, you could have just told me that you're killing me. There was no need for all this hassle. \"That marks the beginning of their duel. Yet, she gradually comes to realize that Dongfang Zui looks similar to someone she met when she was a child. And unbeknown to both, a conspiracy spanning two generations is slowly showing its fangs.",
