  "overview": "Wildlife expert Casey Anderson is not afraid to get dangerously close to the largest and fiercest creatures on the planet. In Monster Encounters his mission is to track down and document evidence of animals so large, or unusual, that they defy belief. Employing the latest technologies and his lifetime of wildlife experience, Anderson travels to remote corners of the earth in search of elusive creatures. Throughout the eight hour-long episodes, he leaves no stone unturned, collecting clues and connecting the dots until he gets up-close and personal with the beasts he seeks.",
