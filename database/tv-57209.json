  "overview": "British pilot Jimmy Porter crashes his aeroplane in occupied France and immediately finds himself on the run from the Nazis. He meets a young girl, Nina, a part-Jewish agent with important information, and vows to get her back to Britain. He is helped by another agent, code-named Vincent, and pursued across France by S.S. Officer Lutzig , and the ambivalent Abwehr Sgt. Gratz, a complex psychological character who is implied to fall in love with Nina. Unlike most previous war dramas, the Nazis were presented as more than just fanatical thugs. Manhunt was a World War II drama series consisting of 26 episodes, produced by London Weekend Television in 1969 and broadcast nationwide.",
