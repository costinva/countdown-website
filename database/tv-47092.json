  "overview": "Susan Calman, along with BBC Scotland, has decided that in these unprecedented times we all need a bit of cheering up! In line with the new social distancing rules, she has decided to make a television show completely remotely from the bottom of her garden. In a bid to get all the Scottish creatives busy and earning again she invites a host of comedians, actors and musicians to join her remotely through the medium of technology to cheer up the nation. It might be a bit rough and ready, but she's determined to give it a go!Â ",
