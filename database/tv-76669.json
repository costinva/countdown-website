  "overview": "Three years ago, Erik Follestad Johansen put his skates on the shelf. In these years he has been an expert, but now he will lace up his skates again to show Norway that he is still good enough. Follestad takes us inside the clubs in the top division, tells unknown stories and will try to fit into the team. Whether he gets a contract or not is up to the coaches. Will he be successful, or have three years of celebrity life and minimal training turned \"Folle\" into an amateur?",
