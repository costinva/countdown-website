  "overview": "a Rede will take care of the television. Log in and take control. Discover, in awe, the chaos where everything fits; and end up looking, desperately looking. It wants to put us in the mirror. Faced with our obsession. Of the absurd, occasionally visited by moments of salvation. A cyber-series between fiction and documentary about communication in the network age.",
