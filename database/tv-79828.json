  "overview": "This series is inspired by an athlete predestined to mark an era, born to be an idol and committed to a prophecy that his father made: \"my son is going to be known all over the world.\" Rigo is an optimist by conviction, a comedian and a talker by nature, and that is the spirit of the story based on him and his three great loves: the father who takes violence away from him; Michelle, the woman he has longed for since he was a child; and the bicycle that accompanies him to sell lottery tickets in his town and then takes him to the top of the world.",
