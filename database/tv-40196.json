  "overview": "A minibus driver Serhii transports people between temporarily occupied Ukrainian regions and a controlled territory. In his life, there was a terrible tragedy: as a result of the car explosion, the man lost his family and memory. Serhii still could not accept the death of his relatives, and he begins his own investigation of the circumstances of the accident. Help for others becomes the main goal of Serhii's life because his minibus is the only opportunity for locals to overcome the distance separating them from families and relatives. Every day Serhii meets different people, who share their stories, experiences, problems in families, and various views on life.",
