  "overview": "Needless to say, \"Short Short God\" Shinichi Hoshi. More than 1001 works published throughout his life have been published in textbooks and are still being read. Its charm, loved by generations, is the mysterious and exciting elements of science fiction and fantasy, such as \"space,\" \"robots,\" and \"devils.\" Also, a perspective that is mixed with \"funnyness\" and \"irony\" toward humans and society. And above all, it's a short but fascinating story that will surprise you. I will draw such a gem of Shinichi Hoshi as a live-action drama now in Reiwa. In the appearance, there are a lot of talented and individual actors who support this live-action project and love Shinichi Hoshi's work, so to speak, \"Shinichi Hoshi Children\". The lineup is suitable for the diverse world view of Shinichi Hoshi's works, which is like turning a toy box upside down.",
