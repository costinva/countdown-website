  "overview": "Handcrafted is the new haute couture on OMG Fashun as Julia inspires pioneering fashion disruptors to upend traditional style convention, break the rules and redefine \"cool.\" Each episode challenges three disruptors to create a boundary-breaking look born of Fox's beautifully bold brain. Using materials and techniques that would make fashion's so-called gatekeepers squirm, the contestants must race against the clock to compose and style their unconventional ensembles for the judging panel, consisting of Fox, Roach and a rotating expert guest judge. The disruptor with the most eye-catching, unexpected and cutting-edge look is crowned the winner of the competition. Each week's winner is awarded a $10,000 cash prize and gets their garment modeled by Fox.Â ",
