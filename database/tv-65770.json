  "overview": "The \"boy-meets-girl high fantasy\" is set in a world where land is being swallowed by the encroaching Great Snow Sea. Humaniy ekes out a harsh life above the Tenmaku (a wordplay on the Japanese word for tent) that stretches from the roots to the tops of giant Orbital Trees. The story centers around Kaina, a boy who lives above the Tenmaku, and Liliha, the princess of the small country Atland in the Great Snow Sea.",
