  "overview": "Five businessmen have yet to run into an idea or a product that is too far-fetched for them to invest in. These five friends have proven through grit, determination, street smarts and force of will that success does not always require MBAs. They use a \"right connection\" and their combined knowledge to continue to strive to be successful and have fun as they plan and grow their ideas toward greatness. \"Our shows celebrate the hustle -- plain and simple. No matter who you are, what you do, or where you're from, it's the drive to succeed that counts,\" said Jim Ackerman, EVP, Primetime Alternative Programming, CNBC.",
