  "overview": "Monk didn't just become MONK overnight: it took years of emotional trauma, mockery, and bullying to make him the man he is today. But the gift for solving mysteries? That was always there. That and the profound social awkwardness. So if you've ever wondered how Monk's career in crime-solving began – or where that milk phobia originated – prepare to have your questions answered in these brand-new Original Webisodes featuring the adventures of Little Monk and his very first assistant, his big brother Ambrose.",
