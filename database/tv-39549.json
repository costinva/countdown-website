  "overview": "Peggy Willenberg and Melanie Metz may not be sisters, but they share passion for severe weather. They met six years ago on a Minnesota storm chaser website and soon joined forces to become one of very few female teams in the male dominated world of storm chasing. Each year, they rove Tornado Alley, in quest of the most terrifying and spectacular sights nature has to offer. In 2003, they formed a tornado tour business, to take guests along on their severe weather safaris, and began to be called the \"Twister Sisters.\" Join Peggy, Melanie and their guests as they search out the most severe weather on the radar. With satellite maps guiding the way, and additional chase teams by their side, the Twister Sisters take you where you've never gone before.",
