  "overview": "Minase Jin, a top student who is indifferent to others, has been living his school life avoiding any interaction with Hirukawa Haruki, a reckless troublemaker in their class. However, one day, Minase accidentally witnesses Hirukawa outside of school, covered in bruises after being beaten by his father. Unintentionally learning this secret, Minase tries to distance himself, not wanting to get involved any further. But he can't get the image of the Hirukawa he saw, so different from the one at school, out of his mindâ€¦As the two begin to discover sides of each other that they never saw at school, new feelings start to blossom, feelings that neither of them had ever experienced before.",
