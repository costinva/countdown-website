  "overview": "It's the ultimate test of precision, pressure and perseverance. In National Geographic's new six-part series TOP GUNS: THE NEXT GENERATION, cameras follow a class of Navy and Marine Corps student pilots as they enter the final and most unforgiving phase of elite strike fighter training. It's six months of high-stakes aerial training, brutal physical demands, and emotional reckoningâ€”where only the top performers earn the chance to fly the most coveted aircrafts.",
