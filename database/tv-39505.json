  "overview": "Alone at Home follows sibling groups whose parents have gone away for a long weekend. Remotely operated cameras film the siblings in their own home around the clock to observe whether, if given autonomy and freedom, these young people seize the opportunity to disregard all the rules their parents have imposed on them or be as good as gold and live by the ethos and rules their parents live by.Closely monitoring the footage from the house at all times will be a close-by safeguarding team of chaperones and psychologists and the parents are just a phone call away should their children want to ask how to put the washing machine on or just boil an egg.",
