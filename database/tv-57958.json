  "overview": "Songkram and Aye both are engineering students and live in university dorms. Songkram is the head student of dorm 3, which is where the \"strong and athletic\" male students are sorted. Aye is the head student of dorm 2, the dorm where all the \"good looking\" male students live. Aye used to be Songkram's tutor and friend, but they fell apart after both of them were chosen to be head students of the dorms. Dorms 2 and 3 have been at each other's throats for generations. Aye and Songkram might act like enemies, but Aye is actually in love with Songkram. However, he thinks Sonkram has feelings for Mean. What Aye doesn't know, is that he's the one Songkram likes, not Mean.",
