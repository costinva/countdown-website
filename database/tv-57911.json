  "overview": "In her 25th wedding anniversary party, Victoria Mendoza finds out her husband Enrique Mendoza has a mistress, Tatiana López. Suddenly Victoria's whole life crashes around her as she realizes her marriage is wrecked. As she tries to heal the pain of her husband's adultery, she meets the 33-year-old Jerónimo out of the blue. Victoria falls for this younger man, giving her a second chance at the true love and passion missing in her loveless marriage. Many of her loved ones oppose her relationship, including her daughters Paula and Mariana, her mother Mercedes and her ex-husband. They blame her for the breakup. On the other hand, her son Santiago offers unconditional support. Victoria has many problems but does she know she has those problems? Can she solve them? So Victoria faces a difficult decision: either fight to keep true love alive or surrender and let it slip away.",
