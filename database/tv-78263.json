  "overview": "Ovoz is an Uzbek entertainment vocal talent show.The main task of this show is to find and select universal vocalists who sing not only in different genres, but also in different languages. An additional feature of the format is that all project participants are selected not by external, but by vocal data. At the same time, due to the lack of genre criteria, participants can demonstrate their vocal abilities to the audience and the jury both in the performance of jazz or rock, as well as folk songs or classical vocals. The participants of the show are mostly established musicians who have passed a certain school of skill, and therefore the mentors of the project do not set the task for the contestants to change, \"break\" their approach to the repertoire and style, but on the contrary, try to choose the performers closest to themselves in the manner in order to. ",
