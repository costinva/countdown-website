  "overview": "Retired Australian detective Jack Darby is fleeing his past mistakes, while English widow Joan Kirkhope is attempting to outrun her grief. Their worlds collide on a remote backroad. They couldn't be more different: the directionless, blunt Aussie and the sharp-tongued Englishwoman. But thrown together and drawn into the intriguing mysteries lurking in the isolated, tropical corners of a vast continent, it quickly becomes clear the most fascinating mystery they face is each other. Thus begins an epic love story; a non-stop road movie; a mystery series; an Outback odyssey. Darby and Joan asks: can you find yourself in the middle of nowhere?",
