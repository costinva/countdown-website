  "overview": "America in Color presents many iconic moments in U.S. history as never before seen - using artistry and cutting-edge technology to transform black-and-white films and photographs from the 1920s to the 1960s. Decade by decade, the story of America, its people and its culture are given new life and shown in vibrant color for the first time.From the 1920s through the 1960s, America transformed from a young country on the rise into a global superpower. It's a decisive period in our nation's history that most of us have only witnessed in black and white, until now. Using digital colorization technology, we present these formative decades as few have seen them, revisiting 50 vibrant years of good times and great despair, technological triumphs, and natural disasters, and global villains and national heroes.",
