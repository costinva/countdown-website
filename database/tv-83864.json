  "overview": "Kathputli is a tale of how greed and deceit can lead to one's downfall, while honesty and patience pave the way to success. At the heart of this narrative are Tabeen and Areeba, two sisters whose vastly different natures set them on contrasting paths. Tabeen embodies sincerity, intelligence, and patience, while Areeba thrives on manipulation, ambition, and greed. Caught between them is Ayan, whose affection becomes a pivotal element in their lives. Unaware of the hidden truths and concealed feelings around him, Ayan's heart becomes a battleground for honesty and deceit. Will Tabeen find the strength to speak her heart, or will silence be her fate? Ultimately, will Areeba's cunning ambitions secure her desires, or will honesty and virtue triumph in the end?",
