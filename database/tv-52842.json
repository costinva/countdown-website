  "overview": "Jeroen Pauw enters into special conversations with people who normally cannot or do not want to come to the studio. People who are the subject of conversation, but often due to circumstances, cannot speak for themselves. In their own grounds, such as a hospital, tbs clinic or nursing home, he conducts in-depth discussions with those involved that go beyond the issues of the day.",
