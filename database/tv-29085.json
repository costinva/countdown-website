  "overview": "When Mrs. Nolan predicts that within a year, Lucy will trudge up the aisle, nothing could be more unlikely as Lucy is anything but marrying type. She enjoys spending evenings in the pub, parties with whoever she wants, her ideal food is a takeaway and cleaning is not high on her list of priorities. But when her other friends' predictions start to come true one by one, she can not help but start thinking ... One day she meets Gus, and she is faced with the big question: Is he possibly the potential Mr. Lucy Sullivan?",
