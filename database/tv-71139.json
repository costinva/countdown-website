  "overview": "Brand new series sees England Rugby World Cup Winners tackle rugby behind bars. Captain Martin Johnson, Jonny Wilkinson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Phil Vickery, Jason Robinson, Will Greenwood, Ben Cohen, Mike Tindall and Matt Dawson - each an England Rugby World Cup-winning legend who together as part of their best ever team, tasted glory in their country's finest moment on a rugby pitch, lifting the William Webb Ellis trophy. Now, this group of legends who made such an unforgettable contribution to England's sporting history are back together for the first time two decades on from their triumph... only this time it's different. Twenty years after they led England to victory in that unforgettable final in Sydney against Australia, members of the team are going behind bars to face a unique challenge, in a new two-part series, which will land during this year's Rugby World Cup, with the tournament also to be shown exclusively on ITV.  ",
