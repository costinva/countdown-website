  "overview": "The project will tell about loved ones, friends, colleagues, partners, pretending to be who they are not in reality. The host - known to many from the flagship project \"Reshala\" - Vlad Chizhov will not only conduct an investigation, but also show how to learn to recognize self-interest, pathological liars, hypocrites and people prone to unhealthy relationships. The host will also advise how to correctly solve the problem and safely get out of such relationships.",
