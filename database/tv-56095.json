  "overview": "DROP is not about Lola, Nata or Alex. DROP is about your friends Vlada, Ania and Artem.DROP is not about a lyceum in the city center. This is about your regular school without show-offs.Stories that are based on real events, not written by scriptwriters for the sake of hype. We are inspired by the atmosphere of \"SKAM France\" and \"13 Reasons Why\". Without gloss, pathos, and long texts. This is a story about cruelty and its consequences.",
