  "overview": "In Smiley, Álex is heartbroken. He was building fantasies with a boy that, a couple of weeks later, disappeared giving him a textbook ghosting. And he is really upset because of it. He picks up the phone and asks out for an explanation in a voicemail that will have unexpected consequences... because he ends up sending it by mistake to Bruno, whom he doesn't know at all. This innocent first mistake is the first one in a chain of events that will change Álex and Bruno's life forever.",
