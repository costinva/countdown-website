  "overview": "Forty-five years after the end of the television series Les belles histoires des pays d'en haut, a revised version of the soap opera enters the airwaves. Proposed by the author Gilles Desjardins and the director Sylvain Archambault, this black version takes on an extra layer of fiction compared to the original scenarios, to the delight of the young and the not so young.",
