  "overview": "Rage of Angels journeys between New York, Acapulco and Paris as Jennifer Parker finds herself in a highly-charged love triangle, romantically pursued by two powerful men on opposite sides of the law. Soaring to the top of her career, the beautiful and now successful Jennifer has become the object of desire of two very different fellow attorneys - one politically ambitious (and married), the other in league with the Mob. With the passion and tension in her life reaching boiling point, Jennifer faces a terrifying confrontation that could destroy them all.",
