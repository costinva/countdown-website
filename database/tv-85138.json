  "overview": "Momentum aims to disrupt the sports media space by offering content that resonates with the next generation of sports fans—those who are often underrepresented in traditional sports broadcasting. Hosted by Kat Sasso, a leading sports creator and influencer, Momentum will provide a platform for young women to engage with sports content in an entirely new way—by young women, for young women. The series is sponsored by MECCA M-POWER – MECCA's movement for social change empowering women and girls. In addition to exploring the latest news and developments in the women's sports space, the series will challenge the traditional sports media landscape by also addressing the diverse interests of its target audience—combining discussions on athletics, fashion, beauty, and lifestyle in a way that reflects the multi-dimensional lives of young women.",
