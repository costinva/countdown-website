  "overview": "Welcome to Crash Course Games! In this series our host Andre Meadows is going to discuss the history and science of games. We're going to talk about video games of course, but also board games, role playing games, card games, even sports! But before we get ahead of ourselves we are going to look at what a game actually is, who is playing these games, and what they are doing to us. It turns out these answers aren't as obvious as they would seem, but one thing is definitely clear: games make up a huge portion of most peoples' lives, and we think that can be a great thing!",
