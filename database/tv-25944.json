  "overview": "FOX's You the Jury, which the network says is not connected to the NBC/Dick Wolf series, will tackle cases — only civil, no criminal — that address hot-button issues such as online trolling, the limits of free speech, and the constitutional clash of gay rights with religious freedom. It will feature prosecution and defense teams that include attorneys Jose Baez, who defended Casey Anthony; Benjamin Crump, who sought justice for Trayvon Martin; celebrity attorney Joseph Tacopina; as well as Areva Martin, Mike Cavalluzzi and Charla Aldous. They will question and cross-examine the litigants and expert witnesses, as they present their arguments to America and former judge of the Superior Court of California LaDoris Cordell. The closing arguments will be presented by the plaintiff and the defendant as they sit across from one another.",
