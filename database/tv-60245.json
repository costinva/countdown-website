  "overview": "From Smurf Berry Crunch to Dr. Pepper gum, the 80s was one helluva good decade when it comes to food. Now, Adam Richman will hit the road on a quest to relive his favorite decade, one delicious bite at a time. From factories that have been churning out our favorite snacks for over four decades, to hole-in-the-wall joints where iconic dishes were invented, to quirky collectors who still have a complete set of Happy Meal boxes, Adam will do what he does best: interact with people, bring passion to what he's learning, and literally devour all things 80s. From unboxing forgotten favorites, to tracking down rarities now worth a fortune, to saluting the birth of icons, Adam will go back in time to celebrate the most iconic foods and brands of the decade. So, get ready to feel the nostalgia because we have ten delicious years of food and drink to explore as...Adam Eats the 80s.",
