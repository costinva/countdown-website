  "overview": "In the future, a man named Sakura is destined to create the \ntechnology for eternal life, which (due to Sakura's lolicon tendencies) \nfreezes all women's aging once they turn twelve. God refuses to allow \nthis, so he sends his angels to the past to kill Sakura before he can do\n this. But one angel, Dokuro-chan, decides to try to change the future \nwithout killing him. Problem is, Dokuro is very temperamental, and is \nconstantly killing Sakura (and lots of other people too) in incredibly \nbloody ways with her giant spiked club. Good thing she can bring people \nback to life - if only to grusomely kill them again the next time she \nloses her temper.",
