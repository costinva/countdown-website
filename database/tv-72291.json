  "overview": "In the pursuit of love, Napdao has been doing everything. She has got her fortune read. She's gone on a string of blind dates. Unfortunately, however, no one seems to be on the same page as her. She starts to think that perhaps her gorgeous and caring boss Pheem could be the one for her. Then Wela, her new team leader, comes into the picture and shakes things up with her observant and affectionate care.",
