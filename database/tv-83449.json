  "overview": "Ima is a single mother with a high school daughter. She has fallen in love again. The other person is Hisame, a graduate student about a decade younger than her. The two are attracted to each other, regardless of their age or circumstances. However, she already has a high school daughter and two other lovers. Ima, who does not feel jealous even if her partner has another lover, has taken the form of a \"multiple love\" with the consent and understanding of all involved, which is a free relationship but is definitely different from betrayal such as adultery or cheating.",
