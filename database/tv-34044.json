  "overview": "Everything's bigger in Texas! Self-made millionaires, Mike \"Rooster\" McConaughey and Butch Gilliam, believe in the American Dream and are looking for ambitious entrepreneurs to spread their wealth. Along with their buddy, Gil Prather, these larger-than-life personalities have been wheelin' and dealin' for years and are eager to find the biggest and boldest investment opportunity. Living life by the \"Golden Rule,\" Rooster and Butch are eager to help other folks get a leg up the same way others helped them along the way. A pretty balance sheet will only get you so far in West Texas - these good old boys will only throw their money down after they've tested the true measure of an entrepreneur's character. Integrity first; idea second.",
