  "overview": "In this series, we meet some of the UK's most unequal households, in which one partner – usually the woman – is taking on more of the domestic load than anyone else in the home.In each episode, two participants (not always women) from two different households down tools and walk out on their ungrateful families. Those left behind must try and muscle through one week without the family linchpin, as we uncover the real dynamics of the household. As their strike unfolds, we follow both sides as they try to cope in this unique look at how we all live together in modern Britain.",
