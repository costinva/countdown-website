  "overview": "De Gaulle à la plage is faithfully adapted from Jean-Yves Ferri's comic book that candidly scratches this hero of French history. Absurd, subtle, sometimes «potache» but never vulgar, the series is a comedy playing with historical references as well as immediate and punchy visual gags.",
