  "overview": "The show featured Gregory Proops as the high commander with Bill Bailey \nand Craig Charles as his two captains. The space-age gameshow was set in\n a futuristic ship and was monitored by the super computer \"Hal\" (as \nGreg calls him). Each captain would have two guests on his team for \nevery episode and they would try to prove who knew more sci-fi facts \nthrough a variety of ways including trivia, guessing what props were \nused in which movies, etc. The show ran for ten weeks and was a great \nopportunity for Greg to show off his gameshow host skills.",
