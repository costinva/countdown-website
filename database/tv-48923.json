  "overview": "Life and love for young people living in the 90's with their dreams heading towards the millenium. Yet their dreams are not lofty aspirations but realisable ordinary ones that each of us embrace in our hearts. The main character Hyun Woo, a boyish and outgoing young man is a computer mechanic who is dilligent at work and loves to do all kinds of sports. Deep in his heart he has never forgotten his first love, Chae-Hee who is now engaged to his highschool senior. Thus, he never quite pays attention to the cute Won Young working in the same office. Won Young promises herself not give up her dreams - love for Hyun Woo and her ambition to eventually become an announcer on TV. In times of lonliness and anger she climbs up to the rooftop of her office building and shouts on the top of her voice. This is a drama viewing young people's lifestyle, goals in life and their innocence and purity in love.",
