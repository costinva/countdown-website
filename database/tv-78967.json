  "overview": "How (Not) to Get Rid of a Body is a new psychological true-crime thriller exploring the outlandish lengths diabolical killers have taken to get away with murder. Each horrifying episode reveals never before seen material and recounts in-depth tales of twisted criminal masterminds who go to great lengths and efforts to concoct plans to dispose of their victims. However, the unflinching tenacity and determination of the country's top detectives who are hellbent on solving these heinous crimes, bring to light these crimes and justice to those criminals who would have certainly gotten away with murder and been free to kill again.",
