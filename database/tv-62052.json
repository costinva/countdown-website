  "overview": "This sitcom follows the adventures of rebellious flight attendants and pilots of an imaginary airline. Macan, Ceger, Nina and Medena were put in one heavenly crew as punishment, and the strictest persecutor Dana was assigned to persecute them in order to discipline and put them in order. And the masters who maintain the planes - Krca and Mile, two completely different, and perfectly compatible best friends, take care that everything is in an even bigger mess. Each episode follows a flight to a new city where the crew encounters new crazy passengers and all sorts of vicissitudes and dangers that life among the clouds brings. But what makes their small group special is the love and friendship that is born between them, and together they manage to overcome all problems and dangers and find their way home.",
