  "overview": "The love and family stories filmed by journalist and author Christiane Sadlo under her pseudonym \"Inga Lindström\" are characterized by impressive landscape shots, all of which are filmed at original locations in Sweden. In the foreground of the 90-minute are great feelings and moving fates, but the protagonists are always led to a happy ending. The film series does not have a continuous storyline, and each episode is cast with other characters.",
