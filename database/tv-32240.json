  "overview": "In this comedy game show, six single celebrities have been paired into three very unlikely â€˜couples' and set ridiculous challenges to attract maximum social media attention. Can they persuade their friends, family and fans that it's real? More importantly, can they generate the most likes and comments on social media to win the Celebrity Showmance crown and trophy? Unlike any other TV game show, in Celebrity Showmance the public become unwitting judges, as each couples' chance of winning hinges on the amount of buzz they generate across social media.",
