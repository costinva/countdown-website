  "overview": "A gripping tale of twisted fates unfolds in lawless Joseon, where the once-pristine Gyeonggang River has turned into a murky stream. Jang Si Yul, a man who buries his past to survive as a gangster, Choi Eun, a sharp-minded and righteous soul, and Jung Chun, an idealist striving to become an honest official, find their destinies entangled in a world where justice is scarce, and survival comes at a cost.",
