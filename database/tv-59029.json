  "overview": "David Moscow is on a worldwide adventure to discover how food really makes it onto your plate, by making signature restaurant meals literally from scratch - and by 'from scratch' he doesn't mean preparing food with basic pantry items! David will hunt, gather, dive, forage and grow each ingredient to make one signature meal in each episode. So many ingredients go into every bite â€“ history, geography, culture, anthropology, science and technology. David will experience all of it to see how much love, passion and hard work go into the food we eat.",
