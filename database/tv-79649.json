  "overview": "West End Murders is the story of three murdered women: their lives, their deaths and two failed police investigations. Following former Met Police DCI Colin Sutton and his team, this investigation examines the historic cold case of the â€˜Bunny Girl' murders, uncovering a key link between the murders of Eve Stratford, Lynda Farrow and the seemingly unconnected case of murdered schoolgirl Lynne Weedon, revealing the pattern of a potential serial killer gone unnoticed for decades in the process. With this new revelation, can Sutton and his team finally bring justice and close the book on a 40-year-old case once and for all?",
