  "overview": "It's a bit like Bosco meets Stranger Things as RTÃ‰ One broadcasts a brand-new four-part mini-series for the whole family - and mixes the nostalgic with the surreal.Set in Lough Dan in Wicklow, where the Kelly clan decamp to for a reluctant family Holiday. But the dilapidated holiday park isn't as dull as it initially seems to 12-year-old Kevin, his screen-obsessed sister Katie and their distracted parents Mary and Tom. In fact, before long, things get really weird.",
