  "overview": "Why has hatred of the Jews continued to reappear over the ages? From anti-Judaism to modern anti-Semitism, this great documentary story explores the many facets of the phenomenon, from its origins to the present day, with the help of some thirty international experts, drawing on both on a body of archives and on historical 3D images originally developed by Ubisoft for its Assassin's Creed series.",
