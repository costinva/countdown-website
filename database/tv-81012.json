  "overview": "In the past, the Empress Dowager, in her quest for power, schemed to change Feng Yi's gender, forcing Feng Yi to live a life disguised as a man. Upon reaching adulthood, unwilling to remain a puppet emperor, Feng Yi began to cultivate her own strength. However, her attempts to curry favor with the Prime Minister ended in the Prime Minister's sudden death at a brothel. When she tried to win over the Grand Tutor Sima Qi, he repeatedly attempted to kill her. This is the bitter and tragic life of a woman ruling as the emperor, where a single misstep could cost her life.",
