  "overview": "Tardisodes were mini-episodes which served as prologues for each episode of Series 2 of the BBC Wales version of Doctor Who. They were made available serially, with a new one debuting in the week prior to the episode to which they were attached. They were primarily meant to be seen on mobile telephones and were released to paying phone subscribers first. As each week progressed, however, the BBC made them available as webcasts.",
