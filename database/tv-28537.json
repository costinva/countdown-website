  "overview": "The related Todd and Taylor families switch houses to see what life is like. The Todds must adjust to city life while the Taylors become farmers. This plot may not seem original, but the writers have found hundreds of ways to make us laugh and cry. The Todd family - widow Sandra and kids Campbell and Pip must leave their familiar country setting for the city. There they meet resident bully Shelley, who has her own troubles, and the handsome neighbour Greg. While his son makes friends with Cam, Greg tries to make himself more-than-friends with Sandra. Meanwhile, John and Liz Taylor must lead their kids, Marissa, Jason and Kimmi on the quest to the country. The country characters include real estate womaniser Derek Unn, his wife (known as Attila), determined Isabelle Turnbull and her beautiful daughter Katy. Scott Major also stars as the confused farmhand Tom.",
