  "overview": "Ces gars-là (Those Guys, english title) is a TV series that bridges the barrier between funny and dramatic story telling, Starring bilingual comedian Sugar Sammy and director Simon Olivier Fecteau. This modern buddy comedy takes you into the world of two friends, Sam and Simon, whose intrinsic differences spice up their friendship and set up a variety of adventures for the odd couple. The show is inspired by the lives of the two writer-comedians and follows them through their quest for love, their relationships with their families and how they navigate the highs and lows of their own friendship. Their absurd experiences emerge as the two stars attempt to live life with the best intentions while reflecting on life in their somewhat trivial, somehow profound, but always-hilarious philosophy, in a similar vein of The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm and the Wedding Crashers.",
