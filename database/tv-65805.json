  "overview": "Police and communities have a new weapon in the fight against crime. Across America, Real Time Crime Centers use surveillance cameras, tracking systems, and gunshot detectors to solve crimes and bring criminals to justice. Every episode of this pulse-racing series features two high-octane stories with life and death stakes. Filmed across nine states, with exclusive access to nerve centers from New York to New Orleans, each story includes incredible CCTV footage along with interviews with the major protagonists â€“ police solving the crimes, witnesses, and the families of the victims.",
