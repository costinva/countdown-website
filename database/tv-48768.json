  "overview": "Hurricanes, typhoons and major storms reach their maximum power at sea, and during that peak power thousands of marine workers are forced to deal with those immense forces in order to carry out their jobs. National Geographic placed more than 1,000 cameras with people working at sea all around the world, on cargo ships, military vessels, fishing boats and oil rigs, to document monster storm systems on a scale never seen before.",
