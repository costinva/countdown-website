  "overview": "Mom, dad, two sons, one at the institute, the other works as a bodyguard. If you look at them, they seem like an ordinary family. If you meet one of them in a crowd of city passers-by, you won't pay attention to them – they are invisible. This is only to their advantage, because while you don't notice them, they look at you and see everything that you would hardly want to show to anyone. Everything falls into place when you learn the past of Larisa and Viktor (mom and dad): until recently, they worked in the seventh department of the KGB. Today they are already retired, but, as we know, there are no former employees of the security services, and they continue to engage in surveillance privately and on private orders.",
