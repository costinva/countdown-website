  "overview": "Showtrial will once again centre around a hotly contested criminal trial that divides the nation and takes place in the full glare of the media spotlight.When the high-profile climate activist Marcus Calderwood is left for dead in a violent hit and run, he uses his dying moments to identify his killer - a serving policeman. But who is this unnamed â€˜Officer X'? What does his own history reveal about the nature of trauma and revenge, and was Marcus's death a careless accident or cold-blooded murder?",
