  "overview": "Fukuhara Kota is a bumbling college student who is plagued by terrible luck. Although he never gets down about it, you can bet if something could possibly go wrong when he's around, it almost certainly will! One day, he is about to walk in front of a car and end up in a traffic accident when he is saved by a fellow college student named Naoya Shinomiya. The latter is Kota's polar opposite: His \"problem\" is that he is \"cursed\" with endless good fortune.Kota is grateful for Naoya's assistance, and tries to ask his new acquaintance to be his friend â€“ but phrases his request badly and accidentally leads Naoya to believe he is asking for them to become lovers. The \"lucky\" Naoya surprisingly agrees and the duo embarks on an unorthodox relationship. Will Kota's chaos bring a taste for the unknown into Naoya's life? And will romance bring spell the end for Kota's bad luck?",
