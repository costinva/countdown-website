  "overview": "Cock'd Gunns is an unflinching rockumentary series about the worst band you've never heard of: Cock'd Gunns. Led by the brothers Van Gunn (Reggie and Dick), Cock'd Gunns could become the biggest band in the world. The only thing separating them from their dreams is a total lack of work ethic, songs, a record deal, talent, and legions of fans.",
