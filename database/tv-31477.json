  "overview": "Growing up, Bishop and Pike had very different lives. Pike's dad was the first black police commissioner and the son grew up always trying to live up to expectations, while Bishop grew up looking for a father figure as he was passed around foster homes, moving from school to school. Bulletproof will put their friendship to the test for the first time.",
