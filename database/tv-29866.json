  "overview": "A four part series for ITV2 where we get to see Britain's favourite girl group as never before, revealing their dream passion and getting to give it a go in The Passions of Girls Aloud. Cheryl, Sarah, Kimberley and Nicola leave behind the familiar world of pop music for a challenge of a lifetime pursuing passions that they have only ever dreamt of being able to do; challenges that they have to learn under immense pressure and then ultimately prove whether they could perfect their passion or not! Watch Cheryl prove herself in the world of Street Dance, Nicola launch a Make-up range, Kimberley prepare and perform in a West End musical and Sarah fulfil a life time ambition of playing in a professional Polo match. Results we're both rewarding and dramatic.",
