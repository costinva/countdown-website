  "overview": "Archibald's Next Big Thing follows the adventures of Archibald Strutter, a simple chicken who â€˜yes-ands' his way thru life. Though living in the moment often leads him astray, Archibald always finds his way back home, to an egg-shaped house in the center of Crackridge he shares with his three siblings, Sage, Finly, and Loy, and his trusty sidekick, Bea. Archibald's Next Big Thing is a fresh comedy about one chicken's joy for life and celebrating the journey, not just the destination.",
