  "overview": "Pearson centers around the world of recently disbarred NYC powerhouse lawyer Jessica Pearson as she adjusts to down and dirty Chicago politics. Newly appointed as Chicago Mayor Bobby Novak's right hand fixer, Jessica is quickly embroiled in a crooked and dangerous new world where every action has far-reaching consequences. With her compulsion to win, Jessica is forced to reconcile her unstoppable drive with her desire to do the right thing â€“ two things very much at odds.",
