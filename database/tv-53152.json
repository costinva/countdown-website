The school is surrounded by police cars. Ambulances and police forces are rushed to the scene, as well as terrified parents and journalists. Rami Davidi (37), a police detective from the special investigations, is one of the first to arrive at the crime scene. After all, this is his high school, the one he attended as a teenager. Along with everyone else he expects to catch the killers still hiding inside the building. But to their surprise, the rescue unit finds only terrified students inside, wounded and reeling with shock, along with four corpses.",
