  "overview": "The writers, Bart and Tom, intended to show the viewers and the public how fake (or not) television really was. Each week they made several tv reports and asked \"little Flanders\", which they called the crowd in the studio as they represented Flanders, if the tv reports where true or false. Each week they invited a special guest to discuss the events.",
