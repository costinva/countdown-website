  "overview": "Killer games - hardly a word in the German gaming landscape is so charged, hardly a debate was so emotional. Anyone who hears the word killer games today thinks of \"Counter Strike\", of \"Doom\", but most likely also of: Erfurt, Winnenden - the scenes of school shootings that shook Germany in the early 2000s. The culprits were quickly found: so-called first-person shooters, in the tabloid style they were called killer games from then on. But there is so much more behind the story of these computer games - ZDFinfo tells it in a three-part documentary series.",
