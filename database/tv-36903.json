  "overview": "The work of Dr. Vincent Flemming, a psychotherapist whose purpose is to heal people, is a constant conflict with his function in the Homicide Division of the Berlin Police Department, where the task is to convict offenders. This work is especially problematic because his immediate supervisor is his ex-wife, Ann Gittel. Dr. Flemming has become internationally renowned through his university lectures, but is best known for his radio show \"The Tricks of the Soul\".",
