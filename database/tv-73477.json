  "overview": "Beasts Like Us follows Natalie, Raffi, Simon and Lukas in a new para-normal. Monstrous creatures and humans live side by side, more or less harmoniously. At least that's true in theory. Because sometimes it is quite tricky to fend off a monster attack without violating the \"Creature Rights Charter\" and the exclusion of vampires from public pension insurance triggers a discrimination debate - headaches are inevitable. But the group's biggest problems remain interpersonal ones: in the midst of the supernatural chaos, the four young adults struggle with the big and small dramas of adulthood, love and thus finding their place in the world - although zombies, vampires and other beasts don't necessarily exist make it easier.",
