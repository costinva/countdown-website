  "overview": "\"Zoloto Gelendzhika\" is a relay race filled with the most incredible obstacles, and athletics competitions in non-existent sports, in which everyone can set their own world record, or at least smile broadly at the camera, falling into yet another treacherous trap. In the vast expanses of a giant theme park, built in a record 1.5 months, participants will face the craziest challenges, overcoming which they will be able to get closer to the prize. But the main presenter and manager Ivan Okhlobystin is not going to part with his gold so easily.",
