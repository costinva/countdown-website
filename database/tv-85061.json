  "overview": "To mark the 80th anniversary of the eventual Liberation of the Channel Islands, Britain Under the Nazis: The Forgotten Occupation tells the story of one the most controversial periods in WW2 British history, utilising eye-witness accounts from those who lived through it. In June 1940 Britain abandoned the Channel Islands to the Nazis. 69,000 islanders were left to live with the enemy, facing an impossible dilemma: to collaborate, resist, or tread a difficult line in between. Their words, drawn from little known diaries, memoirs and letters from both the occupiers and occupied, are brought to life by actors for the first time. Leading historians Gilly Carr and Louise Willmot bring together their meticulous research, including recently unearthed documents that shed fascinating new light on this forgotten period of fascism on British soil.",
