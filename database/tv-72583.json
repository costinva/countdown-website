  "overview": "When much-loved children's author Julian Hartswood inadvertently causes a social media storm, his career and that of his illustrator wife Ingrid appears to be over. That is until Austin, the neurodivergent son that Julian never knew existed, turns up out of the blue. Could embracing this modern nuclear family be Julian's route back from cancellation? Will Ingrid forgive him for being such a pompous shit? One thing is for certain: if Julian thinks Austin is going to be a push over, he's in for a rude awakening.",
