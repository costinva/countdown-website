  "overview": "Created by Thomas Bidegain and Fred Grivois, directed by the latter with infectious jubilation, Machine appears like a UFO. Through the meeting between \"Machine\" and JP, an unlikely alliance is played out: that of kung fu and the communist struggle. If we add to the cocktail a dose of offbeat humor and a supercharged soundtrack (Anastacia, K. Maro, Menelik, etc.), we get an explosive series where narrow-minded unionists, a conspiracy influencer, a sentimental businessman, a former secret agent or a soldier with a fragile psychology cross paths, pell-mell... Between pop culture and social conscience, Machine walks a tightrope, and hits the mark - like its heroine. In this very physical role, Margot Bancilhon, who performed most of the stunts herself, impresses. In search of meaning, both relentless and tormented, this mysterious woman with no name finds salvation in the friendship she forms with the endearing JP, himself saved by reading Marx and cycling. How to upset the balance between the weak and the powerful? Here, the answer is clear: with punches!",
