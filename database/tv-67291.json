  "overview": "Three Women tells the true story of three American women who suffered private and/or public backlash for their sexual desires. The protagonists are a mother in her 30s who rekindles a flame with her high school sweetheart when her husband refuses physical affection, a 23-year-old woman who reports her former teacher for pursuing a sexual relationship with her when she was 17, and a restaurant owner whose husband and business partner picks out her experimental sexual partners â€” the series will take a multigenerational approach. It will revolve around women in their 20s, 30s and 40s.",
