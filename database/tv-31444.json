  "overview": "Over its more than 4-billion-year history, the earth has been home to repeated violent climactic changes, which have caused mass extinctions. And yet, life has survived. In fact, these same catastrophes helped bring about the evolution of life, from the simplest microbes to the complexity and diversity that is found on the planet today. Featuring location footage, interviews with the world's foremost scientists and cutting-edge computer technology, Miracle Planet recounts the profound and gripping story of Earth's mysterious evolution and reveals the surprising roles that sheer chance has played in the development of life. Narrated by Christopher Plummer, it is an exhilarating virtual tour of our planet's first 4 billion years. Don't miss it.",
