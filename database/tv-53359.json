  "overview": "Yippee, Yappee and Yahooey were three bumbling, Musketeer-like dogs who loyally served their king as palace guards. Yippee was the tallest and had purple fur, Yappee was medium height with white fur, and Yahooey was the shortest, with orange fur. Whenever the king summoned them he had to duck for cover because his \"three goofy guards\" were prone to making flamboyant, crash entrances. Their incompetence caused the king a considerable amount of grief, but apparently never enough to replace them.",
