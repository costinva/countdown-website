  "overview": "In this brand new four-part ITV series, Britain's worst cooks are set to be transformed into impressive gastronauts, to the utter astonishment of their family and friends.Each week someone with minimal cooking skills will have just five weeks to learn and prepare a show-stopping restaurant meal, taught in secret by a top chef. The trainee's family and friends will be invited to a restaurant at the end of the show, unaware that the food they are eating is entirely the work of their loved one, who previously struggled to boil an egg.Each secret chef has one close friend to help them with the burden of keeping their mission under wraps, whilst providing a kitchen in which to practise their culinary skills.",
