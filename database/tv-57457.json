  "overview": "The Great Big Tiny Design Challenge challenges designers to renovate an entire derelict mansion, inspired by real-world designs. The catch is that the luxury fantasy home they must renovate is doll sized.Whilst the projects may be tiny, the task is huge. Our cast of miniacs (people who create all things miniature) will be set a series of challenges to test their design and practical skills. From crafting a Regency inspired dining room, complete with a dinner service and spread to die for to designing an Art Deco Bathroom, fitted with a a fully plumbed bath. Many of the installations they create in each mini build will need to function and fit the brief to pass the judges' critical eye.",
