  "overview": "The Nude is one of the most enduring subjects in western art history. But how nude can a nude really be? Hannah Gadsby investigates the stories behind some of the world's most famous nudes, only to discover that every nude wears multiple veils of history and context. This bold two-part series from Hannah Gadsby pokes at the problematic gender politics at the heart of the nude. Hannah will ask all the tough questions and yet provide none of the answers, because she is not a man and so is unable to mansplain. Look out, Hannah Gadsby's fired up.",
