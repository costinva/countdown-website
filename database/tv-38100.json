  "overview": "Random Acts of Flyness from artist Terence Nance (An Oversimplification of Her Beauty) explores evergreen cultural idioms such as patriarchy, white supremacy and sensuality from a new, thought-provoking perspective.A fluid, stream-of-conscious response to the contemporary American mediascape, each episode of Random Acts of Flyness features a handful of interconnected vignettes, showcasing an ensemble cast of emerging and established talent. The show is a mix of verit√© documentary, musical performances, surrealist melodrama and humorous animation. Nance and his collaborators weave together such themes as ancestral trauma, history, death, the singularity, romance and more, creating a television show like nothing seen before.",
