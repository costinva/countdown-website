  "overview": "Like every child, Kika has plenty of questions about what's going on around her. But it's not always that adults are ready to satisfactorily answer everything Kika needs to know, even if the subjects are known. The series, Where it comes from, takes advantage of these moments to tell, in a simple, fun and accessible language, everything the girl wants to know.",
