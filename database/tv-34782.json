  "overview": "For father-son duo Doug and Brad DeBerti, custom car building isn't just a hobby, it's their life. From creating a truck modeled after a fighter jet to developing the first ever drift racing truck, the DeBerti's have been building one-of-a-kind cars and trucks for more than two decades, winning over twenty awards, and turning the family business into a household name. Together, they push the boundaries on each custom build to create outrageous, state-of-the-art vehicles in the brand-new series, Twin Turbos.",
