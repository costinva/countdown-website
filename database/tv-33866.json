  "overview": "The Agency infiltrates the modeling industry like no other television series has, with a stark look at the men and women who search for, mold, scold and comfort raw, young hopefuls --all in an effort to groom the world's most marketable beautiful people. \"The Agency\" is not about glamour. It's about the harsh realities of an industry in which millions of dollars are at stake daily and the competition for talent can lead to both euphoric victories and bitter defeats. From eating disorders to money disputes to ego clashes to poaching by other agencies, \"The Agency\" casts an unblinking eye on the super-high-stress jobs of the people who are completely hooked on the business of brokering beauty.",
