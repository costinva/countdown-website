  "overview": "Kings From Queens: The RUN DMC Story, produced by Believe Entertainment Group, is the never-been-told story of the most influential rap group in the history of music, RUN DMC. Joseph \"Rev Run\" Simmons, Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels, and Jason \"Jam Master Jay\" Mizell met on the streets of Hollis, Queens before these hip-hop legends would go on to legitimize a genre of music that critics labeled a fad. Their influence on culture shattered racial barriers, making them international stars and fashion leaders of the â€˜80s. After a series of life-changing events and challenges, including the murder of their beloved DJ, Jam Master Jay, Rev Run, and DMC reunite to tell their story and celebrate the genre of music they established.",
