  "overview": "Driving Test is a heartfelt factual show that goes behind the scenes of people learning how to drive. From their very first lesson to the test itself, we'll witness the highs and lows and the hits and misses as the drivers and their larger-than-life instructors score them a Pass or Fail. Set in Darwin, the only place in Australia where the driving test must be recorded, we meet people from all walks of life as they're unleashed on the streets. They set off on the ride of their lives hoping to secure the ticket of their dreams â€“ a driver's licence.",
