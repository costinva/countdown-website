  "overview": "In a city sewer, a group of researchers discovers murdered teenagers who have never been searched for. Unwinding this case step by step, the police come face to face with the unconditional evil — the whirlpool of the big city, which sucks in and destroys the weak — those whom no one loves and does not wait at home. Evil destroys people with impunity, and each of the heroes will face it personally, look inside himself to meet his own demons and fears.",
