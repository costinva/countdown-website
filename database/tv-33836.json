  "overview": "Wayne can't help himself from righting the world's wrongs. Now, against all odds, he and his one-of-a-kind girlfriend Del are on a road trip from Brockton, Mass to Ocala, Florida to reclaim what's rightfully his: a majestic old car that was stolen from his sick father. With trouble behind them and danger ahead, Wayne and Del are bound to find themselves with their backs against the wall. But that's okay. They've been there before.",
