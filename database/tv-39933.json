  "overview": "Inside Jokes follows unknown stand-up comics vying to make it into the world-famous Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal. Will their performances launch their careers into superstardom, just like New Faces alumni Pete Holmes and Colin Jost, or will they choke under pressure? For this group of comics, who have sacrificed much in pursuit of a dream, there is no bigger moment.",
