  "overview": "In Flip to a Million, HGTV conducts an edge-of-your-seat house flipping experiment as never seen before. The series follows two couples who are both successful house flippers in their respective markets: Jonathan and Danielle Wrobel of Long Island, New York, and Jason and EJ Williams of Chicago, Illinois. The pairs are dropped in an unfamiliar city - Dallas, Texas - where they set out to prove that in the world of real estate, it's possible to start out with almost nothing and turn it into a fortune. With an initial budget of only $1,000, each couple works the real estate and flipping market to buy and sell properties. Their goal: build to a $1 million house sale in just six months. To try to make it happen, the duos must go to any length to flip to a million.",
