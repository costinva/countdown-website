  "overview": "\"The Therapist\" has nothing on Dr. Blackson…as in the unfiltered and unbothered comedian, Michael Blackson. Have issues in the bedroom, with body image, or your sexual orientation? Come to Dr. Blackson and he will fix you like that. But is he kind, gentle, and caring? Hell, no. Get your mind right or else, modasucka! This series is the natural next step for Michael's hugely popular ‘advice column' on his Social Media pages, where random people write to Michael with their problems, then await his usually outrageous advice.",
