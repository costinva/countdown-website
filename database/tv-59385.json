  "overview": "Four 112 dispatchers are faced with the most extraordinary emergencies to deal with under great pressure. They attend to callers in telephone conversations that are far from mundane. Conversations that you hope you never have to have in your life, but which are the order of the day for the dispatchers. From the perspectives of the control room and the caller, decisions are made on the spot that can make the difference between life and death. Every conversation is a battle against time.",
