Why were innocent fathers and mothers murdered by the country's most ruthless bank robbers? What does a serial killer trust who can get out of bars after decades? How does a person who bury an 11-year-old child alive feel? In the show, sinful souls were interviewed, broken family members, eyewitnesses testify about their pain. Sinful Souls presents the most brutal Hungarian crimes of the last decades with the help of original, never-before-seen recordings and reconstructed scenes played by actors.",
