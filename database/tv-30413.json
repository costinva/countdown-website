  "overview": "Eight 21st century lads are transported back to the Roman Empire to see if they can cut it as gladiators. The handsome boys will fight it out with help from their loving girlfriends. They may have the muscles but do these lads have what it takes to go down in history?Cameras will follow eight modern day couples as they're transported to an ancient world where they'll live and fight like gladiators did 2000 years ago. Along the way there'll be blood, sweat and tears. However, only the very best will make it through to the Emperor's Games where one of them will emerge victorious and take home the Emperor's gold (which today works out at ‘approximately' £10,000!).The boys will be trained by the fearsome \"Doctore\", played by David McIntosh, and take part in daily, physical tasks, leading up to a grand final where they'll battle it out in a colosseum in front of a baying crowd. Those who don't cut it will be banished from the city. Acting as the eyes and ears of the elusive Emperor is the Emperor's Assistant, \"Dominus\", played by Tom Bell. The boy's girlfriends will join them on their journey, helping to train and prepare them for the Games as well as immersing themselves in ancient Roman tasks - from wine making to sculpting.",
