  "overview": "Britain's Best Junior Doctors features eight teams of three of the best junior doctors from different hospitals across the country. The contestants tackle an array of rigorous questions ranging from diagnosing a patient's symptoms, prioritising cases in a mock A+E department and getting stuck in with their chosen specialism. With four heats and a final, two teams face each other in each individual heat and then the two highest scoring winners from the heats will go head to head in Friday's final to find out which team will be crowned champions.",
