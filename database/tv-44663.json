  "overview": "In three cities with a glorious past, Odessa, Warsaw and Prague, three young women are murdered. Within days, their bodies are found, each showing the same brutal sings of violence. One thing is clear: they are obviously connected. The three separate police departments' investigations soon find a way into each other's back yards and start working the cases together. The lead detectives have to balance their own personal issues. Ukrainian militia captain Serhij has a troubled past, the Polish superintendant Maria fights for her position in a male-dominated police department and the experienced Czech detective Viktor has to put off early retirement. But they are dealing with a deranged serial killer operating on an international level. Soon, they realize that all the victims were aspiring models and actresses. Does the murderer hunt his prey in the entertainment industry? The trail leads to shady businessmen, their lawyers, corrupt politicians, and professional killersâ€¦ but what connects Odessa, Warsaw and Prague?",
