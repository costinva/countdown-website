  "overview": "Australia's most daring social experiment has gotten a whole lot bigger! Based on Seven's controversial series Seven Year Switch, six couples will put their relationships to the ultimate test in The Super Switch. At a crossroads in their relationships, these brave couples will say goodbye to their loved ones to live in an experimental relationship with a total stranger. They will be paired with a like-minded person who will hold up a mirror to their own behaviour and help them answer the question - is the grass greener on the other side? This year, the social experiment has been supersized with all the couples split into two mansions, transforming the experiment into a shared experience. With three experimental couples living in each mansion, new dynamics, relationships, questions and answers will help all our couples decide if their real partner is in fact the one.",
