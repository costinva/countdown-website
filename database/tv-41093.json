  "overview": "Axel Daeseleire investigates six controversial environments where one thing is clear: everything is for sale. A woman, an animal, an organ and even a child. For gross money and with the right contacts everything is possible, rules and laws often do not even play a role. Axel Daeseleire brings international traffic to, among others, Ukraine, Namibia, Nepal and India.Traffic Axel exposes social and ethical issues, which are strongly substantiated in journalism. Axel takes plenty of time to speak extensively and ask pertinent questions. Just as important as exposing the practices is understanding how it all works. Who are the winners and who the losers? Who will become richer and at the expense of whom?",
