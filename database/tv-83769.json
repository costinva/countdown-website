  "overview": "Stepan Grachev, a young and ambitious manager, brings documents to the house of the owner of the company, the millionaire Heraklei Lvovich Korneev. At this time, the boss hotly dismisses his deputy and all the servants. Flying to Turkey for two days on business, he instructs Stepan to \"look after the house.\" Stepan enjoys relaxing in a giant estate with swimming pools, greenhouses, a car park, a yacht and wine cellars. He makes the fatal mistake of telling his marginal relatives about the house. Stepan unsuccessfully tries to get rid of the visiting relatives, at the same time getting involved in love adventures. The boss unexpectedly stays in Turkey for another three weeks, during which Stepan will have to restore the damaged property of the owner, resolve the love triangle and save the company and the house from a raider takeover.",
