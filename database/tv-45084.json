  "overview": "Mother and daughter team Kath and Jenni run City Sauna, Sheffield's premier â€˜massage parlour'. Prostitution is legal in Britain as long as you're working alone. But if two prostitutes work together it's classed as a brothel and is illegal.In this series, Kath and Jenni give viewers a year of privileged access to City Sauna to show how their business works, to meet the women who work there, their clients, the intricacies of the business and their fight to legalise the brothels of Britain.City Sauna is now under more threat than ever before. Just 30 miles away, in Holbeck, Leeds, the council have closed down brothels and launched a controversial scheme to decriminalise street prostitution. It is the UK's only decriminalised street prostitution area and the stated aim was to make street workers safer. But residents blame it for soaring crime and drug abuse.With a major government enquiry underway into the buying and selling of sex, is it now time to rethink the law on brothels?",
