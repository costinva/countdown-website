  "overview": "After investing all his savings to travel with his son to the World Cup, Lucho is shocked when he learns that the Argentine team gets disqualified from the games. He and a handful of his co-workers, a flashy group of losers about to lose their jobs, decide to take \"justice into their own hands\", so they devise a plan to steal the celebrated World Cup trophy during its promotional tour of Argentina. This way, the national team could rejoin the games, and he and his son could travel to World Cup as originally planned.",
