  "overview": "The Million Pound Cube sees pairs of contestants, from the same household, take on The Cube. As well as facing solo games, they will also face brand new two player challenges.Each pair will have nine lives to complete seven games, each worth an increasing amount of money, as they move closer to the huge jackpot. Players will have to overcome extreme nerves and frustration as they take on deceivingly simple tasks such as throwing a ball into a container, balancing on a beam or stopping a clock at precisely 10 seconds. But will they have what it takes to beat the mighty Cube?  ",
