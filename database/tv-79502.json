  "overview": "Aussie Shore is the first Australian iteration of the smash-hit, international reality \"Shores\" franchise. The outrageous original series', Jersey Shore and Geordie Shore, were pioneering cultural phenomena that launched the career of the most famous of all partygoing housemates and our Aussie Shore House Boss, Charlotte Crosby.The Aussie Shore house in which Charlotte presides, promises to be the epicentre of outrageously wild action that takes place in the non-stop party town of Cairns in tropical North Queensland, where the sun is hot, the drinks are cold and the tan lines aplenty.",
