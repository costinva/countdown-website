  "overview": "30-something couple Jane and Charlie have given up on making a baby the fun way. Diagnosed with infertility, they are resigned to needing invasive assistance if they are to become parents. They are determined to keep things fertili-fun, but what happens when so many people are involved in the intimate act of procreation? Can a marriage survive with the financial and emotional pressures of infertility? Darkly funny and achingly honest, How to Buy a Baby follows a couple through a cycle of in vitro fertilization.",
