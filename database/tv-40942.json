  "overview": "1001 Nights is often thought of as being too brutal, too sexy, too misogynistic, too macho and far too complex. Well, not if you tell the true stories which is exactly what HAHN FILM intends to do with the production of this CGI TV series. HAHN FILM exposes the truth about these wondrous fables through the real protagonist - Sherazade and her genie of the lamp, Halil. Without this feisty woman, the adventures of Aladin, Ali Baba or even Sinbad the famous sailor would have been just another long forgotten camp fire yarn.",
