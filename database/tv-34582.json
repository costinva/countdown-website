  "overview": "Columbus, Pizarro, Corts, Magellan, Ojeda ... these names may all ring a bell. Though gracing a street or a subway station, many of their stories, however, have been all but forgotten. We may know that Balboa discovered the Pacific Ocean, but not that he rose from stowaway to a hero of his time after sneaking onto one of the ships bound of for the still unexplored Americas, and that with him travelled Pizarro, who, to conquer Peru, committed authentic atrocities. Conquistadores is a new and ambitious historical production that faithfully portrays what the first 30 years of the Discovery and Conquest of the America were like, from when Christopher Columbus left Spain in 1492 until the first round-the-world voyage was completed.",
