  "overview": "Start Up is a television program that offers its viewers an up-close and personal look into the world of the modern American entrepreneur. As complicated as starting a business may seem, our goal is to DE-mystify the process by sharing the real life experiences of average Americans who are taking control of their own destiny while creating jobs for others. Start-Up is a truly original show with a first-of-its-kind premise, giving viewers a unique behind the scenes look at how average people are rebuilding America, one business at a time.",
