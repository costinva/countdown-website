  "overview": "The Africa Riding series sets out to meet a community of \"riders\" who participate in creating a new cultural and social order in Africa. From Ghana to Rwanda, via Senegal and Uganda, these board enthusiasts entrust us with the keys to their \"playground\": dented sidewalks, deserted squares, bumpy roads or even sandy tracks ... So many obstacles that make these free spirits of true warriors on the asphalt as in life.",
