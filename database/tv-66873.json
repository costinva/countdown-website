  "overview": "STAT is a look into the daily lives of staff members at St-Vincent Hospital in Montreal. We discover four longtime friends who work within the same walls and who occupy very different positions. The group of friends is still in shock over the passing of Fran√ßois, Emmanuelle's lover and Philippe's best friend, who died a year earlier in troubling circumstances. Around them is a group of characters who bring the different departments of the hospital to life, in this world that never sleeps.",
