  "overview": "Sosuke Nakata, is just your everyday salaried worker. There is really nothing special that stands out about Nakata. He is a serious guy, whose life mostly consists of going back and forth to the office each day.Suddenly one day though, Nakata just happens to meet a certain woman by coincidence-top star, Hikaruko Kirishima. Just by talking to her, Nakata is left standing feeling like he has just seen a dream.Several days later, Kirishima calls an emergency press conference.And there she announces...\"I am now dating a gentleman by the name of Sosuke Nakata, a salaried worker, whom I intend to marry.\"An announcement about their \"relationship,\" out of the blue! More than that, this top star's boyfriend is just your typical salaried worker!! What does Kirishima have up her sleeve as she hides behind her intrepid smile?!Nakata obviously has no idea about what happened at the press conference. He also doesn't know what lies ahead for him at work, and about Hikaruko's true intentions.This story, a somewhat funny, but romantic love story, follows the footsteps of a man and woman from very different worlds, as they experience the painful and sometimes remarkable ups and downs of love.",
