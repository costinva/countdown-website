  "overview": "Friends Erik, Mikael and Benny grow up together in a chain house area outside Stockholm in the 1970s. Their families hang out as neighbors do, but behind the facades hide pain, sorrow and lack. We follow the Munksås, Törnblad and Elofsson families and witness events that have painful consequences, sometimes immediately, sometimes many years later.",
