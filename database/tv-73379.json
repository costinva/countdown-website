  "overview": "Undercover: Caught on Tape is a true crime series offering viewers a first-hand account of dangerous criminal investigations from those closest to the action - the undercover agents themselves. Undercover agents are on the front lines; often risking their lives to gather evidence that may help take criminals off the streets. Each episode includes surveillance video and audio recordings from actual investigations to reveal the critical moments that could make or break a case - or an agent's life. Living in secrecy and often unrecognized beyond their tightest circles, these agents rarely get to tell their stories, until now.",
