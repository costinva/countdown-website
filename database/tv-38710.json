  "overview": "Adaptation of a series by Caracol Television, Colombia (\"La Ex\").The story centres on a modest young woman, Anna Polyanskaya. Anna and her husband Leonid work in the head office of a fairly successful cosmetics company \"Glamour Co\", which, however, is not going through the best of times. Life at the married couple Polyansky measured and, as it seems to the heroine, quite happy. But the idyll ends when, on the day of her thirtieth birthday, Anna learns that her husband is having adultery with her boss. As they say, trouble does not come alone. Caught under the hot hand of the new director, Anna is close to being fired from her favourite job. Family happiness and career of the heroine collapses, and she has to build her life from scratch. In this the heroine is helped by her second self - more determined than Polanskaya herself - Yana. Will Anna divorce her beloved husband and how will her future career develop?",
