  "overview": "Chris Addison brings his considerable comedic talents to the helm of a brand new comedy series in a celebration of story telling, stand up and new comedy talent. An intimate show filmed in front of a live audiences. Each week Chris is joined by three-up-and coming comics who each bring something 'to show'. The items they produce - whether they relate to something topical, personal or completely random - act as a launch pad for a stand-up routine on a relevant subject. Chris guides the proceedings, while his other guests get a chance to chip in to the discussion, and members of the audience also provide random items, inspiring the comedians to use their quick wit and improvisation skills.",
