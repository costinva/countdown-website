  "overview": "For a woman who leads a life centered much on men, their favorite fairytale would go something like this. She is a woman in a terrible situation with little power, then one day a dashing prince would come riding on his white horse and save her with a single strike.However, for an independent woman, who does not rely on men so much, their favorite would be that of a devoted and strong bodyguard, who provides the assurance to leap forward. If you are neither just a pretty face nor a traditional woman, but a woman like Juliet in this story, then who would you choose to be?",
