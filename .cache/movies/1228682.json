  "overview": "A 17-year-old girl experiences a sexual awakening when she falls head over heels in love with her female teacher. She writes this down in her diary, and writes so well, vividly and recognizably that both mother and grandmother think the book should be published, without taking into account that the girl has only written it to keep the crush alive for herself.",
