  "overview": "Shining Vale is a horror-comedy about a dysfunctional family that moves from the city to a small town in a house in which terrible atrocities have taken place, but no one seems to notice except for the mother â€” and the evil spirit that's trying to possess her. It's a show about mental illness, small town politics, religion and a family battling their demons. But in a really funny, and scary way.",
