  "overview": "In this new era, Catalina, the head of the DEA in Colombia, has a new challenge: to track down a criminal organization that is trafficking a new synthetic drug. What she ignores is that her daughter is part of the cartel that traffics them, and that Yésica, her worst enemy, has infiltrated the DEA. The mafia has become sophisticated. A \"consortium\" of mobsters integrated by the Mano Negra, Villa, Titi and three girls whom they will call the Cartel de las Babys will flood the world with \"XY4,\" a new drug capable of awakening unpredictable effects in those who consume it.",
