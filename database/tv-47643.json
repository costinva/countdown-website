  "overview": "There is a place where deep-rooted tensions and skeletons in the closet are thickly veiled by generations-learned etiquette and hidden agendas. A place where the Constitution and the Bible are required reading, but behind every sun-worn smile there's a dark secret. A place that can be just as shadowy as the muddy waters that run through it, especially when it comes to planning, committing, and covering up a crime. While highlighting how law enforcement in the South is a personal business, not a scientific one, Southern Gothic explores the duplicitous characters, unique settings, and boundless mystery of murder in the American South.Â ",
