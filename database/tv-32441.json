  "overview": "Hang Ups is a dark comedy about Richard Pitt, a therapist at a crossroads who starts treating patients via webcam. After his regular practice collapses, Pitt's few clients present a catalog of neuroses, phobias, issues, anxieties and psychopathies during heavily improvised therapy sessions. But his greatest challenges are the daily interruptions of a demanding extended family, errant teenagers and his own trouble-filled past.",
