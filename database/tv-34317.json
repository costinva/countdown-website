  "overview": "The Village explores the residents of a Manhattan apartment building who find that, despite a difference in age, race, culture and lifestyle, find that the more their lives intertwine, the more complex and compelling their connections become, thus proving life's challenges are better faced alongside family, even if it's the one you make wherever you find it. All under one roof we will meet a recovering war vet, a pregnant teenage girl and her single mom, a cop with an unexpected love interest, a woman hiding a terrifying secret from her husband and a millennial lawyer who might find his grandfather is the best and worst roommate he ever could have hoped for.",
