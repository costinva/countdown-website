  "overview": "StandUp Festival Open Microphone. Every year more than 1000 comedians from 200 cities of 20 countries come to Moscow to perform at a large-scale StandUp festival. They have long been engaged in humor and are already known in narrow circles, but have not yet made it onto television. Up to this point! We chose the best festival participants and gave them the opportunity to tell their jokes to millions of viewers. The host is Alexey Shcherbakov, resident of the StandUp show.",
