  "overview": "Despite being the proud owner of six catgirls alongside his sister Shigure, Kashou Minazuki moves away from home to open his patisserie La Soleil. While unpacking, he makes a startling discovery: two of his catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, have stowed away in his luggage! Although the twins desperately want to stay by their master's side, Kashou has no idea if he can manage both his new shop and the two catgirls. But what if having more hands on deck is exactly what he needs?",
