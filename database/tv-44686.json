  "overview": "Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream takes viewers on a spectacular journey to places they rarely get to see - from the Jonas Brothers tour bus to private family dinners to their living room at home to the breathtaking backstage moments seconds before they hit the stage. It's not easy balancing the life of a rocker with the life of a typical prank-playing, music-loving teenager. Everyday teens by day, superstar rockers by night - Jonas Brothers are truly living the dream.",
