  "overview": "Fatih is an idealistic History teacher who is handsome and honest. On the day he graduated from the university, Orhan appeared, who said that his father was his colleague, and explained to Fatih the facts about his family history, which he never knew; Fatih's father is an 'Akıncı Bey' of Ottoman ancestry and was martyred as a result of an assassination attempt. Fatih will continue this sacred duty that has been going on for centuries. Over the years, Fatih is trained with the help of Orhan and wages war against any criminal organization that poses a threat to his country. While teaching history during the day with an extraordinary understanding of education, he takes on the role of Akıncı by hiding his true identity with the mask he wears at night. With his operations, he turns into a folk hero day by day.",
