  "overview": "I Hate Suzie is a bold, bracing, funny drama about the moment in life when the mask slips, asking if any us can survive being well and truly â€˜known'. Suzie Pickles, a star on the wane, has her whole life upended when her phone is hacked and a photo of her emerges in an extremely compromising position. This excruciatingly honest show reveals her unmasking and its trauma episode by episode, through the stages of Shock, Denial, Fear, Shame, Bargaining, Guilt, Anger and Acceptance as Suzie and her best friend and manager Naomi try to hold her life, career and marriage together in the face of being exposed for who she truly is. But who the hell is that?",
