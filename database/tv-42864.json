  "overview": "Sam is a middle school teacher loved wholeheartedly by her students, a bit less by her colleagues. She struggles in her role as a mother. She loves men, but doesn't really love any of them. At work, at home or in her love life, Sam is totally unconventional and always follows her instinct. She thinks she's happy that way, until her past comes rushing back in after 20 years--and turns her world upside down.",
