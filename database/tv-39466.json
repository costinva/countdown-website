  "overview": "Full-blown fun on TLC with The Unpoppables, a new six-part series following the innovative world of balloon art. The Unpoppables follows Addi, Katie and Brian - the uniquely talented staff at New Balloon Art - as they twist and tie balloons of all colors, shapes and sizes into elaborate, large-scale creations. In each half-hour episode, the team is commissioned to create an out of this world balloon installation for a special event or occasion. After meeting with the client to determine a theme, Addi, Katie and Brian get to work conceptualizing and creating - working with an average of 15,000 balloons to build a latex work of art in under 72 hours.",
