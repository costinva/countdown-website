  "overview": "Matar al padre shows the story of Jacobo Vidal, an authoritarian lawyer in his work and in his family who wants to have control of all areas of his life and those around him, especially his children Valeria and Tom√°s. At the time of post-Olympic Barcelona, he will have no qualms about overcoming all obstacles that may arise so that the well-being of his family fits in with his vision of life. But fifteen years later, in the economic crisis, Jacobo will realize that his life is not as planned: his wife has thrown him out of the house, his son has given himself to alternative therapies, his daughter wants to live away from him and above it he is ruined and homeless. For all this, he begins to question his way of seeing life.",
