  "overview": "Paris, 2213. Like all boys approaching the age of 15, Anatane Goliatkine knows that he will soon be taken to Okura. Like his father before him, he will become a docile Buzi, a worker destined to work on the Great Project of Clunk, the dictator ruling the new world order since the end of the third Great War which ravaged the planet. However, during a simple snowball fight, Anatane's fate changes. Discovering an incredible power of invisibility, the boy then becomes the most wanted fugitive in the world... Representing a direct threat to the Clunk dictatorship, Anatane also reveals new hope for all the rebels and resistance fighters dispersed around the world. To put an end to the dictatorship, to free men from their Buzi condition, Anatane Goliatkine leaves Paris with his friends Nikita and Nevenaa, and his younger sister Ariane. Thus begins a long journey to the East, towards Okura.",
