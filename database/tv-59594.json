  "overview": "Diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer at six months old, Shauna's treatment allowed for remission, but resulted in a side effect no one predicted - she stopped growing. The chemotherapy made her pituitary gland almost dormant, leaving Shauna with a childlike appearance and standing at only 3 feet and 10 inches tall-- the average size of an 8-year-old. Except, Shauna is 22.",
