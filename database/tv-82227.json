  "overview": "Pryce Cahill is an over-the-hill, ex-pro golfer whose career was derailed prematurely 20 years ago. After the collapse of his marriage and getting fired from his job at an Indiana sporting goods store, Pryce hedges his bets, and future, entirely on a troubled 17-year-old golf phenom named Santi. Stick is a heartfelt, feel-good comedy about a found family and their relationships set within the world of golf as it's never been shown before.",
