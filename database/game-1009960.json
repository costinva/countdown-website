  "overview": "No screaming ðŸ¤«DÃª 1 Bit ao GustavoGek is a questionable mix of horror and comedy. Just after you insult your favorite streamer, youâ€™re dragged into a cursed game controlled by the unpredictable GlitchedGus â€” and now, you must collect and deliver bits to him, as he pleases. Get ready to face levels filled with challenges and bizarre enemies.Inspired by the famous nextbots â€” mechanic of PNGs that chase you non-stop â€” the game takes this concept to the extreme with plot twists, hidden secrets, not-that-hard puzzles, and a sus sense of humor, all wrapped in a chaotic environment.You can laugh, you can shit yourself, you can laugh until you shit yourself... but donâ€™t forget to give 1 bit.WARNING: THIS GAME CONTAINS FLASHING LIGHTS AND IMAGES",
