  "overview": "Comedian, actor and artist Johnny Vegas is to embark on his most personal project in an artistic love letter to his hometown. Johnny Vegas: Art, ADHD &amp; Me will see one of Britain's best loved entertainers and trained potters take on the biggest artistic challenge of his career: to create a piece of public art for St. Helens in Merseyside. What starts as a creative endeavour turns into a journey of self-discovery when Johnny receives a diagnosis of ADHD. Though the original artistic vision falters, the documentary uncovers a silver lining—an honest and heartfelt conversation about mental health and understanding yourself.",
