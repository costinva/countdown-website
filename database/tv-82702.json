  "overview": "20 years ago, Elena's family falls apart when her daughter Frida is taken from her and left to die, leaving her alone with Rebeca, her youngest daughter. For 20 years, Rebeca lives a humble life that does not belong to her, until she discovers her true origin and decides to take revenge when she learns that her sister Angelli lived a life full of all the luxuries that she lacked and that, in addition, she is committed to José Emilio. Don Emilio is blinded by his affection for his two grandchildren José Emilio and Misael Aranda, his beloved, who disappoints him for being the cause of a multimillion-dollar fraud that puts the family business at risk. Elena helps her daughter to regain José Emilio's love and, upon discovering Rebeca's perversity, they both decide to face her before she causes them mortal harm. Rebeca and Misael's evil deeds are discovered and they will have to bear the consequences so that, in the end, José Emilio and Angelli can be happy forever.",
