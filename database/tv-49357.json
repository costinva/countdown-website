  "overview": "With the help of his young assistants, Mr. Wizard starts each episode with a demonstration that at first glance should be impossible, but is actually based firmly on basic scientific principles. Mr. Wizard's explanations are aimed at kids, but are in-depth enough to be educational and interesting for anyone. His experiments are usually kept simple enough for parents and kids to re-create at home.",
