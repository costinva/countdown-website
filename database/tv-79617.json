  "overview": "Anatomy of Lies reveals the rise and fall of Grey's Anatomy star writer Elisabeth Finch, whose jaw-dropping lies fooled Hollywood for years, and became fodder for many high-profile episodes of Grey's. The story is told by some of her closest contacts, many speaking for the first time. Originally reported in the Vanity Fair article \"Scene Stealer,\" the docuseries reveals how Finch, a master of manipulation, saved her best fiction for her own life story and exploited the empathy of those around her. Her final mark was trauma survivor Jennifer Beyer, who entrusted Finch with her deepest secrets. But as Beyer uncovers the web of lies that deceived Hollywood for years, she faces a daunting challenge: can she reclaim the narrative from a convincing storyteller who showed no signs of stopping? ",
