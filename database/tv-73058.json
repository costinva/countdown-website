  "overview": "The Billion Dollar Goal traces the extraordinary evolution of soccer in the United States, from its beginnings as an immigrant's game to the historic moment in 1989 when Paul Caligiuri's unforgettable goal ended a 40-year World Cup qualification drought. The series, featuring the late acclaimed journalist Grant Wahl as supervising producer, unveils the untold story of the sport's struggle for recognition in a soccer-skeptical nation as told by Wahl and other prominent voices in American soccer.",
