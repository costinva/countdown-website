The Dhaba is not a business but an emotion for Ginni that supports many lives and Aditya Raj Singh wants to take over that Dhaba for his project. Ginni is very protective of her Dhaba and says that love cannot be priced as she sells food with love that he cannot buy. Channa Mereya revolves around how Ginni fights Aditya Raj Singh who wants to buy Ginni's business but ends up falling in love with her.",
