  "overview": "In Rum för dig, celebrities get the chance to decorate at home with someone who meant a lot to them - using Laila Bagge and her interior team. Celebrities get the chance to give back and let someone else stand in the spotlight. In addition to a program full of interior design tips, we also get to know our celebrities from a different angle. A lot of laughter, warmth, inspiration and a tearing touch will be when every new room is created to perfectly fit for those who live there.",
