  "overview": "Accidentally hearing how Robertino Loretti sings, he began to sing along ... and it turned out that his voice sounds better than that of the Italian from the record! And Varvara Stepanovna, a young music teacher, did everything so that Maestro Grachev himself, the leader of the Children's Choir, could hear Yura - a tyrant and a genius! And soon Yura and his Voice will become famous all over the country! And the Children's Choir will radically change the fate of not only singing children, but also adults ... From a diplomat to an old veteran, from a soloist of the Operetta Theater to a physicist-inventor who, thanks to the Choir, will meet the love of his life.",
