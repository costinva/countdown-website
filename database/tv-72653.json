  "overview": "All your favorite MotorTrend hosts are also stuck at home and finally have time to catch up on some personal projects of their own, so we asked them to film what they are doing! Whether its learning new skills, building a new rig to help around the shop, or finally catching up on a project car they have been neglecting for years, they are rolling up their sleeves and taking you into their home workshops for a little slice of their life.",
