  "overview": "In search of sensational material for her blog, metropolitan journalist Tatyana Blok ends up in the Russian village of Nizhniye Brody. The reason for shooting is large-scale: one morning in the village of Upper Brody (across the river from the Lower) all the people disappeared. Together, twenty people. Money, documents, and all livestock remained in place. People seem to have evaporated in an instant. Tatyana takes over the investigation. For her, this is a chance to prove to everyone that she was fired from television for nothing and that she is capable of making high-quality investigative reports. Cultural and everyday differences between locals and visitors will become the main source of a large number of curious situations. The heroine will have to learn to live in the village, or rather, to survive in it.",
