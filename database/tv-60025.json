  "overview": "Computer science major Chu Sang Woo is the epitome of an inflexible and strict rule-abiding person. While working on a liberal arts group project with freeloaders who don't put in any effort, Sang Woo reasonably decides to remove their names from the final presentation. But he didn't imagine how involved he would become with the person whose study-abroad plans were messed up because of that project. The involved person: the campus star who everyone knows, Department of Design's Jang Jae Young. He has everything from skills, looks, family background and good relationships except for 1 big problem: Chu Sang Woo. What happens when an engineer and an artist whose personalities are like oil and water have to work together? Jang Jae Young is like a semantic error in the perfect world of Chu Sang Woo. Will Sang Woo be able to debug this?",
