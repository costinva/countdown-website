  "overview": "Three bakers, at the top of their game, compete to see if their hyper-realistic cakes can pass for real world items when placed right next to actual items found in the grocery store. Hosts John Henson and Jocelyn Delk Adams task the bakers to make and then hide their cakes in plain sight throughout a grocery store setting, where two teams of cake fans will race to determine what is real and what is cake. The bakers must use every innovative and creative technique in their arsenal to make their cakes look just like the real deal! The challenges will increase in difficulty to make the cake artists push their cakes and skills to the next level.",
