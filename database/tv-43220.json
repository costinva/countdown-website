  "overview": "Meet the Larkins--the put-upon and crafty Alf, his domineering wife, Ada, aimless son Eddie, daughter Joyce and her American ex-GI husband Jeff, a barely employable writer of stories for cowboy comic \"The Bullet\". They all live in a state that falls somewhat short of domestic bliss at 66, Sycamore Street, in a suburb of London, next to inquisitive neighbour Hetty and her family.",
