  "overview": "The three-part documentary brings to life a Biblical story that has always struck fear into the hearts of mankind: the story of the Ten Plagues, a catastrophic series of natural and environmental disasters. Using the Scriptures as a historical source, scientists, historians and theologians can now prove that the account of the Plagues was based on actual events. Their trailblazing scientific research yields startling new theories and sheds new light on the Bible.",
