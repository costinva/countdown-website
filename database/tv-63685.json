  "overview": "The Equator wraps Earth in a 40,000 kilometre ribbon of sunlight, abundance and astonishing nature. It is known in science as the \"cradle of nature\" – because all species first arose here – and as the \"museum of life\" because rarely do creatures here go extinct. Now, as our warmest region gets hotter, the Equatorial paradise is changing. Equator: The Line of Life is a fascinating series that explores that change while reveling in the beauty of this extraordinary place.",
