  "overview": "November 11, 1918. At the end of the First World War, the surviving humanity realizes that the world of yesterday has definitively disappeared in abysses of suffering. Seven months later at Versailles, the victors make a Peace imposed on the vanquished: the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires disappear, and on all the continents are born new nations, often conceived in pain. Populated by traumatized veterans, widows and orphans, exiles, deportees, the world is trying to rebuild itself after the earthquake of the Great War. Faced with the uncertainty of tomorrow, the good will incarnated by the \"League of Nations\" fail to recreate a peaceful world. Injured wounds get gangrenous. The Germans are humiliated. Greeks, Turks, Armenians are displaced. Hungary is cut up. America is isolating itself. The hints of independence shake the British Empire. Russia is falling into a bloody civil war. Then a period of precarious equilibrium begins, where hate, fear and rancor re-emerge from the depths of society, sowing chaos in the new world order: revolutions, crises, waves of migration and civil wars, are fertile ground for nationalist movements determined to impose their totalitarian ideology by arms. As Western populations blindly attempt to forget Charleston's frantic war, the rise of nationalism irreversibly takes the world to a new Apocalypse.",
