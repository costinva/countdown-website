  "overview": "Each hour-long episode follows two mother-daughter duos as they navigate the emotionally charged path towards their goal sorority. Bringing guidance, glam and a lot of honesty to the journey are two breakout names from the world of Rush: New York Times profiled consultant Bill Alverson and The Queen of #RushTok, Brandis Bradley. With their expertise, they help these families prepare their daughters to make a lasting impression to land a spot in their top-tier house. These moms, daughters and even grandmothers and siblings will do anything it takes to help get them accepted into their legacy sororities, making them sisters in every sense. A Sorority Mom's Guide to Rush! goes beyond the filters and fanfare to reveal the love, legacy and ambition that drives these women to do whatever it takes for that coveted spot.",
