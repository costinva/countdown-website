  "overview": "Captain Marryat tells the narrative of adolescent mischievous behavior during the Protectorate era in the exquisitely crafted Children of the New Forest. The youngsters support the king, but the local roundhead opposition is made up of Stalinist thugs who chant hymns and are commanded by a crazy Leveller clergyman. The story revolves around ideas like loyalty and duty, which even the tiniest kids are shown to comprehend sufficiently to put their lives in danger for their king.",
