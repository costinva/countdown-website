  "overview": "Four professional bakers compete for a chance to have one of their unique creations produced and sold online by the Cake Boss. These talented bakers whip up desserts that show who they are as bakers to earn a seat at the table with Buddy Valastro in round one. In the next round, they present the one item they think will help them hit the big time. Finally, the remaining two bakers put all their love and energy into their big-money item in the intimidating production facility at Carlo's Bakery.",
