  "overview": "The grandson of the Yang Manor's patriarch, Yang Chen, was mocked by the members of the clan for his delayed awakening of the Dao Soul. In despair, he broke through his own awakening and acquired the Spirit Emperor Yu. He also realized that his uncle, leading a group of people, was pressuring his grandfather to relinquish the position of the family head. From then on, Yang Chen made up his mind to enhance his own strength in order to protect his family, and he embarked on a journey alone to Mount Youyun in search of medicinal herbs. In the end, he foiled the conspiracy of the group and successfully held onto the position of the family head.(Cgpt)",
