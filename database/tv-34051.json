  "overview": "A dying wife had the best of intentions for her husband and three sons. Ling Hau was dying of cancer and wanted to make sure her husband, Tong Yan Gai, and sons, Chi On, Chi Yat and Chi Yan, were taken care of. So she arranged a new wife for Yan Gai with Frances Wong Sau Kam, and she bore him a son, Chi Foon. But things get complicated when Hau unexpectedly survives, leaving Kam with no legal standing or respect in the Tong family. As Kam plots to inherit the family fortune for herself and Chi Foon, it takes all of Hau's energy to stop Kam and throw her out of the house, resulting in a relapse of Hau's cancer. With the help of Chi On's attorney friend, Sheung Joi Sum, can the Tong family stop Kam's evil plot and restore the family's peace?",
