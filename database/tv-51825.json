  "overview": "When Governor Peter Akala dies from an automobile accident, not only is the state thrown into mourning, but the party hierarchy is also thrown into disarray as well, as there is an informal succession plan which has been pre-arranged, but which is now threatened by the constitution, which is set to produce a new governor who is not only a political â€˜outsider', but a woman as well!",
