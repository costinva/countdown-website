  "overview": "In the second semester of her junior year, 17-year-old Su Qiao welcomed her new desk mate, the \"big celebrity\" Lin Zilu. However, his appearance immediately brought misfortune to Su Qiao. What's even more absurd is that he not only cost her money but also moved into her house, taking over her bedroom. They hadn't been on good terms since they played together ten years ago, and all Su Qiao could think was, \"Classmate, when are you moving out of my house?\" But Lin Zilu didn't just stay; he also became good friends with students like Guan Jinjin and Fang Liang at school, leaving Su Qiao feeling \"isolated.\" Thanks to his good looks and hardworking nature, Lin Zilu rooted himself firmly in Huxin Village! Su Qiao also came to understand the immense pressure he had faced. They gradually got to know each other better as they worked in the fields together, faced thieves together, studied together, and pursued their dreams side by side. As the end of their junior year approached, summer vacation arrived, and Lin Zilu was required by his father to return to the city for his senior year. Youth has the power to turn the fleeting moments into eternity, where both flowers and youth can bloom freely.",
