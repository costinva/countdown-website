  "overview": "Wonder Wheels was a five-minute cartoon produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. A young journalist named Willie Sheeler and his girlfriend Dooley Lawrence solve crimes with the help of his superhero motorcycle, Wonder Wheels. Whenever Willie goes into action, he utters his catchphrase: \"This looks like a job for Won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-won-wonder Wheels!\". Then at the press of a button, Willie's beat-up motorcycle transforms into a souped-up version with a mind of its own.",
