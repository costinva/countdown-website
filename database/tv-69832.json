  "overview": "The title refers to a genteel mountain hotel that might be a peaceful retreat for its guests. But for the waiters, a group of struggling college students in search of hard cash, it's a whole different story. Michael Lerner is a good-looking young guy who is studying to be a doctor. As is the case with most mountain resorts the waiters, who have diverse personalities, must learn to cope with the demands of their guests while trying to get along with one another.Â ",
