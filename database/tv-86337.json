  "overview": "A game show in which hens compete to see which one can keep from clucking the longest? And in which goldfish play croquet and hamsters take part in a Grand Prix? It sounds unbelievable but this series promises just that.In each programme's five rounds animals of the same species strive to win prizes for their owners in games such as That's My Stick Insect and Tortoise Speed Marathon. The owner of the overall winner gets the chance to play for a holiday by answering questions, not surprisingly, on animals. It tests the imagination but in future shows cows, hamsters, snails and ferrets all get to take part.",
