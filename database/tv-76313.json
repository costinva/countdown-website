  "overview": "This is a real fight between those who feel the talent of a comedian, improvise well and dream of performing on stage. Instead of sharpened swords, there is wit, and instead of steel muscles, the participants use artistry. These fighters are not professionals yet, but they have the main thing - the desire to make the audience laugh and the thirst for victory.",
