  "overview": "Wild and wonderful West Virginia is the setting for the blinged-out brouhaha. Mother hen Nettie is keeping a close eye on Mellie, whose behavior lately has been anything but proper for a young, single gypsy woman. Mellie's making a living and searching for love. Meanwhile, Kayla's house is a nonstop circus since she's taken in Laura's family. When the four women get together, whether it's for a little fun or for some serious family business, the fists come out.",
