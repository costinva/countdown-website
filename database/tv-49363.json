  "overview": "A little gypsy girl must overcome personal tragedy and bullying when she is forced to adopt a 'gorgio' way of life. Kizzy was only a Diddakoi, a half-gypsy, but the more the children at school tormented her, the more determined she was not to become one of 'them', living in a house and bullying other people.",
