  "overview": "Take a trip through countries that we usually just fly over when five couples get one challenge: They have to get from Odense to Singapore without boarding a plane! They get different sub-goals along the way and are only equipped with an old-fashioned world map, a little cash in their pocket, but with lots of adventure. Who comes 'First to the end of the world'?",
