  "overview": "Booba is cute and inquisitive, like a five-year-old kid. He explores the world without anger or resentment, only joy and wonder. He doesn't talk, although he does make sounds to express his emotions. Nobody knows where he came from, but he has obviously missed the last 100 years of human progress and explores modern locations with boundless energy and enthusiasm. His awkward movements, combined with a strong desire to learn more about the world around him, often have hilarious results! However, this doesn't satisfy Booba's curiosity, so his adventures will continue in the upcoming series.",
