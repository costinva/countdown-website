  "overview": "Due to a childhood head injury, the investigator of the IC Alexey Platov is unable to feel feelings. He grew up calm, reasonable and lonely. It would seem that this is an advantage in his work, but the lack of any emotions does not give him the opportunity to build normal relationships with colleagues and superiors. One day Platov goes to businessman Miller to get dirt on influential people of the city and his colleagues from the UK, but finds him in a pool of blood, who died an obviously violent death. One of the police officers who arrived on call turns out to be Lieutenant Polina Lavrova. From that moment on, she, along with the emotionless Platov, begins to fight corruption in the local IC and the police.",
