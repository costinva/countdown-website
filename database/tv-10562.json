  "overview": "Squawk Box is a business news television program that airs at breakfast time on the CNBC network. The program is currently co-hosted by Joe Kernen, Rebecca Quick, and Andrew Ross Sorkin. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in investment banks and stock brokerages for a permanent voice circuit or intercom used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer to the squawk of a bird, like a peacock, which is the logo of CNBC.",
