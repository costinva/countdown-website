  "overview": "In Lufthavnens Beredskab, we get up close and personal with the two units 'Security' and 'Fire and Rescue', which each day are responsible for maintaining the safety of the many millions of travelers who pass through Copenhagen Airport around the clock. The two units have to balance between being reassuring and helpful to react quickly when they have to provide first aid to passengers or stop criminals before they take off.",
