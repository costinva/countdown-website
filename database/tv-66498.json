  "overview": "Ye Boon, who has always dreamed of becoming a vet in the small town of Mujin in Chungjeong-do, is instead stuck doing the nitty-gritty work to make ends meet, like delivering calves and vaccinating halibuts. Then one day, she was given psychometric powers during one of her visits to a cow farm. She encounters the passionate detective Jang Yul, who mistakes her for a pervert and attempts to tackle her. Subsequently, Jang Yul relies on Ye Boon and her powers to solve his cases, from petty crimes to serial murder. The two grow closer as they solve each case, one by one.",
