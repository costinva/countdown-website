  "overview": "This brand-new and exclusive two-part series tells the story of the Royal Flying Corps' bitter struggle for air superiority over the Western Front during World War I, a horrifying conflict more thought of a trench-based war.Adapted from the book Bloody April by historian Peter Hart, War Above the Trenches explores the brave new world of dogfights, aerial reconnaissance and bombing missions through the eyes of the men in the air and those fighting in the trenches below.The thrilling story is told thanks to reconstructions, archive footage and the diaries of Royal Flying Corps veterans from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with their words coming back to life to give an insider's view of what really happened when the Allies took to the air.",
