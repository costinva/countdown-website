  "overview": "\"College\" is a unique social experiment about difficult teenagers and their parents who send their unruly children to be re-educated in a school similar to the one they attended themselves. In the project, teachers and psychologists will set new tasks for the heroes, the completion of which will help teenagers overcome psychological problems, decide on a future profession, and say goodbye to addictions. For the sake of change, teenagers will give up important attributes of their past life: the Internet, piercings, bright makeup and unusual hairstyles. Their lives will change dramatically: both the poor and the rich will become equal, spoiled children will learn to appreciate what they have, and will finally be able to improve their relationships with their parents, who have despaired of finding a common language with them.",
