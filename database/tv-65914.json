  "overview": "Pongkhwan is an architect who believes in green design. She tries to hold up those standards both in her work and in her daily life. She receives a job designing a condominium delivering green design and eco-living. It's exactly her thing, but nothing about it proves easy. Pongkhwan's junior colleague Ted likes to tease her playfully. Just as their rivalry is giving way to a new closeness, Pong meets Tle, a barista who runs a shop near her home. What starts as a customer-shopkeeper relationship soon turns into a close friendship. It seems that their closeness won't stop at just being friends.",
