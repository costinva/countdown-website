  "overview": "Comedian Luisa Omielan is on a mission to educate young people about \npolitics and why it is so important. Trouble is, she finds it \nintimidating, inaccessible and has no idea what she is talking about. \nShe tackles the subject by learning on the job and travelling around the\n UK with her dog Bernie, exploring issues that matter to people like \nher. Part stand-up gig, part documentary, this series looks at some of \nthe most important things relevant to young people today.",
