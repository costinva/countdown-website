  "overview": "Set in 1993 North Philadelphia, the adult animated series Lil Kev follows 12-year-old Kevin Hart, whose wild imagination and unshakable optimism constantly collide with his neighborhood's harsh realities. At the same time, his no-nonsense mother Nancy juggles night shifts as an E.R. nurse while waging a one-woman war to keep Kev on track â€“ no easy feat with his mischievous older brother Robert blazing all the wrong trails, his trainwreck father Henry's outrageous attempts to win Nancy back, and his ex-con uncle Richard Jr.'s questionable life advice. Through it all, Lil Kev navigates his rocky upbringing with humor, hustle, and heart, surrounded by the unforgettable characters who will propel him to comedy superstardom.",
