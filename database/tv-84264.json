  "overview": "The THERAPY series is unique for its psychological depth, well developed characters and the setting, mostly concentrated in one area. Most of the story takes place in the consulting room of psychologist Marek Posta (Karel Roden) who attends to several patients with a variety of traumas during the weekdays. Every Monday the psychologist receives a saucy Sandra (Tatiana Pauhofov√°) who confesses in the opening episode that she is in love with Marek.",
