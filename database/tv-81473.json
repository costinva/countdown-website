  "overview": "The main character of the series, Artem Didov, is an almost forty-year-old presenter of wedding celebrations, a balladrasnik and the soul of the company. He lives a cheerful, carefree life, punctuated by odd jobs. Before the war, he loses everything - his bride leaves him, and later he becomes unemployed. On the eve of the invasion, Artem gets drunk and wakes up in the morning from explosions and a terrible hangover. Confused and devastated, Artem realizes that the war suddenly becomes a new reference point for him - a moment from which he can start building himself anew. Already in the training part, he is given the call sign \"Tomboy\", at first as a mockery, but later this call sign in the speech of his fellow students becomes more and more true respect. \"Toaster\" is not at all one of those who was born to be a hero, but forced to become one, although he treats it with a smile and humor.",
