  "overview": "Goro Zaizen and Shuji Satomi are assistant professors at Naniwa University Hospital. Goro is a brilliant surgeon who will do anything to make his way up the corporate ladder. On the other hand, Shuji is a physician who earnestly devotes himself to medical research. Though the two doctors have contrasting personalities and are considered to be rivals, they highly recognize each other's skills.The entire medical department is restless while preparing for the election to choose a new Surgical Department Professor. All Goro has on his mind, is how to win the election. Meanwhile, Shuji is looking after a patient who apparently has pancreatic cancer. He carries out tests on the patient cautiously, and is very careful in telling the patient of the cancer. However, Goro barges in on their conversation, and out of the blue, tells the patient he has cancer, and that he needs an operation right away. Shuji is furious at Goro's rude attitude, and yells, \"Doctors are not God!\" Goro ignores this, and starts laying the groundwork for the operation. But when Goro finds out that the Director of the Medical Department has already given a diagnosis of stomach cancer, he cancels the operation. He feels that pointing out his boss's misdiagnosis will only hurt him in the upcoming election. Shuji however, is determined to save the patient's life and go on with the operation.",
