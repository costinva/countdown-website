  "overview": "In a place where lives are at stake every day, there seems to be no room for anything else, let alone the doctors' own lives. But doctors are only human too, and so it often happens that where there is no room for personal failure, such failure must inevitably occur. The daily struggle for life in the emergency room, and whether God is watching over the patient or everything is solely in the hands of the doctors, brings many traumas, eternal questions and dilemmas to the doctors themselves. Two young doctors arrive at the central reception, still carrying their ideals and ideas from the faculty. These disappear with a flick of a wand when they enter a real hospital, where they are both attested. Agáta and Braňo also have a shared past, which did not go well at school, and so a natural medical rivalry develops between them. Superficiality, superiority, heart, compassion and solidarity are the themes that the doctors deal with day in and day out, and each of them brings their own spin to the job. Every day there is something new to learn, and often the protagonists come to understand that they are not gods. That's probably the hardest lesson of all for the two young doctors who have just arrived and think they can save the world to learn. The doctors at the hospital live their jobs to the fullest, and so have little room to get to know their life partners outside the hospital. Hence, workplace relationships often develop and there is a drawing in of life's vicissitudes and relationship problems right into the ward.",
