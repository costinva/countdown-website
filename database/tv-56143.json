  "overview": "Created and written by Bob Pop and directed by Alejandro Marín, Maricón perdido is a fiction loosely inspired by the writer's own life. The protagonist is a village boy who tries to find his own identity and whom the viewer will find in various stages of his life: the eighties, when he is an overweight adolescent and a fan of musicals; the period of his discovery during his student days in Madrid, and finally the present, where the viewer will find him already a writer.",
