  "overview": "Five university students use Instagram to explore their romantic feelings for one another. They learn to express their most heartfelt emotions via the social networking app's features--making inventive use of comments, likes, direct messages, hashtags, and stories. At the heart of the story is a campus couple In Byuel and Dong Hoon, as well as the ever-cheerful, ever-charming Seul Ki. Will the students' mastery of Instagram help them all achieve their love goals?",
