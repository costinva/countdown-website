  "overview": "At the heart of Victor Lessard is a troubled cop and an addictive, unpredictable mystery. The murders are strange and unsettling, the work of a deeply disturbed mind. And as Victor goes deeper into the mystery, untangling the clues, trying desperately (and in vain) to stop more murders from occurring, his own behaviour becomes more erratic.",
