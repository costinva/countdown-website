  "overview": "Shed &amp; Buried: Classic Cars sees Henry team-up with Fuzz Townshend once again. The duo will be doing what they do best: digging in the nation's sheds, barns and outbuildings, this time to (hopefully) find a tidy profit in some vintage motors.Henry's love of motorbikes and tractors is well-known, but he still has a soft spot for classic cars. Fuzz - who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of all things automotive - is the perfect partner to help him unearth some classic four-wheelers and turn them into nice little earners.That's only half the battle - once their finds are back in the shed, restorer extraordinaire Guy Willison and engineering genius Allen Millyard will be put to the test, turning the rusty wrecks the lads have unearthed into right royal runners.As always, Henry will need to keep Fuzz focused, to make sure he doesn't buy an obscure vintage bus or lorry. Fuzz will have to keep an eye on Henry too, as he's usually done a deal before Fuzz can even lift the bonnet.Â ",
