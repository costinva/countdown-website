  "overview": "The participants of the game  must guess the most common answers of ordinary people to simple questions that cannot be answered unambiguously. For example, \"What food do the French like most?\" The answers are usually completely unpredictable and funny. You can be sure that ten out of a hundred random passers-by think that janitors maintain order in the country. And imagine how many answer options there are to the questions \"What does a woman do when her heel breaks?\" or \"What insects are most often killed?\"\"Battle of the Minds\" is a team game. Each player must express their opinion, offer their version, but victory or defeat goes to the whole team. Most often,  the selection is based on professional criteria, but popular singers, actors, and athletes often take part in it.Two teams compete on the court, the whole process consists of five \"games\" - simple, double, triple, reverse game and big game.",
