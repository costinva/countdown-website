  "overview": "Igor Odintsov is a unique specialist in security systems. But even the most sophisticated technology can fail. An unknown person easily penetrates into his \"smart house\", stuffed with miracle gadgets up to the roof, and takes Igor's wife and son hostage. Now, in order to save his loved ones, Odintsovo needs to commit a crime himself: apply his skills to please the bandits. However, a slippery path rarely leads to a happy ending, and now the hero is rushing through Moscow at night with a heap of new problems, without a clue how to fix his seemingly perfect life.",
