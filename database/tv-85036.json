  "overview": "Arina and Borya love each other, they are happy, and they feel good together. Because they left all the most boring, unhappy, sad and difficult things in their first \"milk\" marriages and entered into a second one. Into a second marriage, where you can be honest, real, and imperfect. In a second marriage, where you can save money on the wedding, because you already know for sure that it won't pay off. A second marriage is not about socks, underpants, mortgages, problems and difficulties. The second marriage is about love! They say there are no perfect relationships, but there are some that you want to tell people about.",
