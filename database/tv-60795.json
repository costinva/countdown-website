  "overview": "Lei Hao Yang is a cat spirit who gets irritated by humans claiming themselves as the most intelligent species on the planet. To Lei, it's a joke how incredible the stupidity of humankind is, as shown by the huge number of humans crazy about cats. However, there is one human to whom Lei feels indebted to - Jiang Ke Qi. To pay her back for saving his life when he was young, Lei has set up a company to secretly provide her with a stable job and high income. When he feels the time is right for her to succeed him as the boss, he realizes that he has fallen victim to the human love that he once so strongly despised.",
