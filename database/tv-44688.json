  "overview": "Eleven unsuspecting contributors are dropped into an 80's inspired lakeside lodge where, after an explosive twist, they learn it's not the Summer Camp they'd envisaged but a Killer Camp with a secret murderer among them.The aim of the game is to earn cash whilst avoiding being killed and therefore eliminated from the game. Over five bloody nights the murderer will bump off their fellow campers in ever more extreme, hilarious and inventive ways; it's the job of the innocents to work out who is responsible before it's too late.Can the innocents find the killer among them and walk away with a big money prize? Or will the killer remain undetected and steal their cash?",
