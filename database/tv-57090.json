This is where Jakten takes place - an intense game where children get the opportunity to compete against their celebrity heroes and idols. A team consisting of three friends between the ages of 10 and 13 is released on an illuminated course, where they must work together to solve exciting and logical tasks. The goal is to get out, before they are taken. For they are not alone in the forest. The team is being chased by a masked hunter who wants to prevent them from escaping.
