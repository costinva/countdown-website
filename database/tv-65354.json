  "overview": "Wednesday Club was founded by Kong who wants to defeat his mother. Close friends, Kong and Pali, gather together a group of friends from Kong's own gang of pals. There are 7 members including Tam, May, Kul, Mac, and Peem. By chance, everyone in the club is a middle child who also feels unaccepted. Wednesday Club is their safe zone. It's a place where everyone agrees to do something together and be friends. The group's iron rule that Kong sets is that members must not love each other, to avoid risking their friendship. However, this rule was broken! The complicated relationships of the members leads to exposure of secrets and stories of their lives that no one wants revealed. Their joining together in Wednesday Club will certainly lead to unexpected stories.",
