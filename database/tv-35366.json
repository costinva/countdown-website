  "overview": "Jane is a 28-year-old woman from Boise, Idaho who has Dissociative Identity Disorder â€“ commonly referred to as multiple personality disorder. Her 9+ personalities, ranging in age from 6-28 years old, appear at any time, usually triggered by stress. Diagnosed only two years ago, she is on a journey to understand what caused the D.I.D. as well as to figure out how she can best co-exist with her many \"parts,\" as she calls them. As a full-time single mother of two, Jane is also studying for a Ph.D in Biology. She'll be coming to terms with her childhood, her relationship with her family, and launching her career.",
