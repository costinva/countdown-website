  "overview": "Elsa and Laurent Lacaze look like the perfect couple, deeply in love with each other after 20 years of marriage and the devoted parents of lively teenage daughter, Lucie. But one day, Elsa doesn't come home after her usual morning jog; she's gone missing, without a trace. Naturally, at first, Laurent and his daughter are worried sick. But their world collapses around them when the police inform them that Elsa is not the woman she's been pretending to be for all these years. Laurent has to face the facts: the wife he's been in love with all these years is a mystery. And her past is coming back to bite them.",
