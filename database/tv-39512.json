  "overview": "This animated version of The Odd Couple features Fleabag (a slovenly, rude dog) and Spiffy (a finicky, neatnik cat) who live together in a home that's half mansion and half run-down shack. They try to get along, but the lazy and unorganized way that Fleabag lives his life--and the orderly persnickety ways of Spiffy--are almost too much for either to tolerate. They share a place of business where the antics of trying to get along continues.",
