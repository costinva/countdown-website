  "overview": "On The Big Fat Truth, JD Roth brings in six former contestants from his former show The Biggest Loser. The six collectively lost 630 lbs. on the show, but then regained the weight (and more!). Roth plans to dig deep to figure out why. \"They started The Biggest Loser unfit, unhealthy and unhappy. Then, they finished The Biggest Loser hopeful, skinny, fit and ready to take on the world. But somewhere along the way, their old habits crept back in. And unfortunately, so did the pounds\", says Roth.",
