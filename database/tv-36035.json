Bitterly aware that she was betrayed by those whom she so trusted, that she can not be near her children: Denis and Lisa. After all, if Inna \"resurrects\", then she immediately goes to jail. Girlfriend - Katya gives her an idea: to use her \"dead\" status, to take revenge on the traitors and at the same time try to regain her good name.",
