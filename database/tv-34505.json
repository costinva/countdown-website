  "overview": "In the Nutty Hill Natural Park, in Canada, there is a small haven of human civilization: the Ranger's Cabin.The bear Grizzy sets up his quarters there to enjoy the comfort of men as soon as the Ranger's back is turned. No animal would dare challenge him for this privilege - except lemmings, the most harmless, stupid and ridiculous family of all mammals! These cheeky little creatures consider the chalet to be a unique amusement park. And there are so many of them that they can stand up to the bear and enjoy their share of El Dorado!By arguing over the occupation of the Ranger's house by all means, Grizzy and the Lemmings end up literally blowing up the house one day when a whole shipment of fireworks is lit unexpectedly. The Ranger Station lands on the Great Wall of China, but there is no question for the passengers abandoning this ship which is now drifting towards unknown territories.",
