  "overview": "Beautiful landscapes, living tradition and welcoming people - this is Ireland. One thousand miles of impressive cliffs, natural beauty and long-living traditions. The massive waters of the Atlantic thunderously surge against the rocks of the Irish coast - the cliffs being amongst the highest in Europe. Take a journey around this green island, and through numerous encounters with typical and atypical islanders, also get to know Ireland from the perspective of the Irish and discover how well the Irish integrate their ancestry into modern day living. This five-part series portrays the wide variety of landscapes and culture, from the traditional pubs in Dublin to the philanthropic dolphin of Dingle, from the intelligent Connemara horses and Rathlin's sailboat carvers to the sorely afflicted city of Belfast.",
