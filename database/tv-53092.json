  "overview": "Iris and Tomer are two theater nobodies whose five-year relationship ends in a rough breakup. But just as Tomer leaves the house, he gets a surprising text telling him that Israel's biggest theater is interested in picking up their mutual dream project. Now they must brave working together as exes in the rehearsal room alongside the pair of narcissistic television stars whom the theater insisted on casting for the lead roles in the semi-autobiographical play.",
