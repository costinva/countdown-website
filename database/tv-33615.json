  "overview": "Cha$e is an action-packed, edge-of-your-seat reality competition show that pits a group of contestants against each other in the quest for a cash prize, while being stalked by relentless \"hunters\". Based on a successful Japanese format from Fuji Television, the action takes place over 60 minutes of real time in various landmark locations. As the clock winds down, the competition gets harder as more hunters appear on the streets, the game perimeter gets smaller, and tasks are assigned that test fraying nerves. Contestants earn money for every second they \"stay alive\", but if they are overrun by a hunter they lose everything. When only minutes remain in the game a final clue to the game's exit point is revealed, and the first contestant to make it to that spot wins the prize.",
