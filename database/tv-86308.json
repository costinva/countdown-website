  "overview": "In 2012, just before the college entrance examination, transfer student Jiang Ling suddenly enters An Zhenzhen's world when his phone accidentally connects to \"Old Jiang\" from 2024. Guided by \"Old Jiang,\" An Zhenzhen approaches the young Jiang Ling, attempting to alter the future, but trigger a misunderstanding with her best friend, Qiu Qian. This seemingly bizarre encounter entwines Jiang Ling's and An Zhenzhen's fates. While uncovering the truth behind the looming crisis together, An Zhenzhen is hit by the public exposure of her family troubles and false accusations that leave her abandoned by those around her. In despair, she climbs to the rooftop, but is saved by Jiang Ling. With his help, she mends her friendship, but a new crisis quietly emerges. To stop her class president, Gu Ming, who is acting under coercion, An Zhenzhen once again steps onto the rooftop. In another timeline, \"Old Jiang\" painfully searches for the truth and tries to change eventsâ€”but cannot prevent An Zhenzhen's death. Just as the story reaches the brink of despair, pages turn and gears softly click. Under the power of words, the cold \"doomsday\" prophecy is quietly rewritten.",
