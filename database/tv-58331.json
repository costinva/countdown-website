  "overview": "When she was twelve years old, Chen Meiru begins to develop her own fantasy about her love, and sketches a drawing of her \"prince\", Ji Ba Bi Lun into her diary. When she turned twenty four, the prince she drew descended from the heaven and landed right infront of her. The diary back then, turned into an incantation that travels through time; and Chen Meiru gets entangled into an epic tale of love and hate that transcends 3700 years.Â ",
