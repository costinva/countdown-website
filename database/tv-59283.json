  "overview": "Takamura Naho is an avid art collector and deputy director of Ariyoshi Art Museum, which she inherited from her grandfather. Her husband, Kazuki, is the third generation owner of Takamura Gallery, a famous gallery located in Ginza. Although Kazuki loves his wife, he is jealous of Naho who has a keen eye for arts which he doesn't have no matter how hard he tries. One day, Naho encountered a painting during her stay in Kyoto. The artist left her name \"Aoba\" and is an unknown painter called Shirane Itsuki who could not speak. Naho later learned from Itsuki that she is the disciple and adopted daughter of famous painter Shimura Teruyama and she has been deprived of her freedom by him for the past 17 years. While following Itsuki's arts, Naho accidentally encounters a fate-changing truth.",
