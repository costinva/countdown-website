  "overview": "Each episode features the family in a different location around the world, with young Jimmy's antics usually driving the plot of the episode. As with most television series oriented around bands, the Osmonds' songs were featured prominently in the series. The series featured Jimmy's pet dog named Poochie, with a speaking mind of its own. Marie was not included in the series, as well as Tommy and Virl, who both could not hear. An abridged version of \"One Bad Apple\" was used for the opening of the show, while a brief instrumental version of the same song was used for the end credits.",
