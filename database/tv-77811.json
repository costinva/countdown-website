  "overview": "Her Serene Highness Aninlaphat, or Princess Anil, and Mom Rajawongse Pilanthita, or Khunying Pin, have been close since they were young. When Princess Anil is fifteen, she must travel to England for her studies, separating the princess from her close friend Khunying Pin by a great distance. The distance, however, allows Anil to come to know herself, to know deep down how she's felt about Khunying Pin without question. Once she returns to Thailand, Princess Anil tries everything to get near to Khunying Pin where she can find the opportunity to confess her love. However, it seems to be an impossible task as Khunying Pin has been engaged to marry Khun Chai Kueakiat.",
