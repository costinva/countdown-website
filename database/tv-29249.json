  "overview": "The waters around the Arctic Circle are amongst the most dangerous in the world and, every year, hundreds of fishermen are lost to the tumultuous seas. The waves are high and small fishing boats are under constant threat of being submerged â€“ but fishing is also incredibly lucrative and a constant lure for fisherman hoping to make their fortune.This reality-based series follows Norwegian fisherman Svenne and his family as they work to revive the struggling remote village of Veidnes, in northern Norway. With only 30 inhabitants remaining, the town is on the brink of extinction.Will the promise of plentiful fish and the opportunity for riches be enough to draw men and women to revitalise the ailing town and fulfil Svenne's dream?",
