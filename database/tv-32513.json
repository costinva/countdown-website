  "overview": "Paranormal activity has always drawn the curiosity of even the most skeptical minds. That mysticism depends on faith that such events are beyond the realm of science. From ghosts to telekinesis, 5th Dimension examines these bizarre occurrences through the lens of science. Many of these happenstances can be discredited, but perhaps there are still phenomena that cannot be explained.",
