She is set to make a major splash on the classical music scene and is poised to marry her fiancé, a rich entrepreneur named Huo You Ze. But the events of one fateful day throw all of this into the air. After a sudden downpour and an ensuing mudslide, she is rushed to a hospital. Her injuries leave her with severe amnesia. When she attempts to work out what is going on, she discovers that a mysterious usurper who looks exactly like her appears to be on a quest to steal her identity – and rob her of what she believes is rightly hers. The affairs of Huo You Ze – and his true intentions – are also shrouded in secrets. Will Luo Qian Yi get to the bottom of this bizarre and potentially deadly web of deceit?",
