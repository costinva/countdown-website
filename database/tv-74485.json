  "overview": "Selena &amp; Yolanda: The Secrets Between Them marks the first time in over two decades that Saldivar has been interviewed extensively in English and on camera.  In a series of wide-ranging interviews from prison, Saldivar details her working relationship and friendship with Selena, and she's not alone. For the first time, members of Yolanda's family discuss the two women and share never-before-revealed documents and recordings in an effort to show there was more to the tragedy than the public knows.Nearly 30 years ago, the tragic murder of Tejano superstar and Mexican-American cultural icon Selena Quintanilla Perez sent shockwaves through the world and bore a legacy that remains relevant today. Her killer, Yolanda Saldivar, is eligible for parole next year. ",
