  "overview": "After solving the complex and brutal murder of a judge, Israeli Police forensics officer Atlas suffers a complete breakdown. Homeless, he lives rough on the streets of Tel Aviv, alone and cut off from friends, family and societyâ€¦ until the day his past catches up with him. Atlas begins a feverish re-examination of the circumstances surrounding his last case, and embarks on a hunt for the real murderer. Joined on his quest by young prosecutor Dita Hispin, he soon finds himself facing the harshest of dilemmas: is the truth worth the price of its revelation? And can the pursuit of justice make amends for the crimes of the past?",
