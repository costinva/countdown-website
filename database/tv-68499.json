  "overview": "Husband and wife team Chrissy and Erik Kopplin are experts at re-imagining small businesses from top to bottom with one objective in mind — to increase revenue. Using their years of high-end retail design experience and construction know-how, the couple overhauls a wide range of brick and mortars in just five days — because their clients can't afford to shut down for weeks on end. From a hair salon in Manhattan, to an independent bookstore in Brooklyn, to a bowling alley in New Jersey, Erik and Chrissy find new ways for them to generate profit and get immediate, tangible results.",
