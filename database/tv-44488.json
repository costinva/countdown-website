  "overview": "The CÃ´te d'Azur, where the inhabitants are as beautiful as the landscape... But beneath the veneer of wealth and fame hides a world of greed and intrigue, even horrific criminal acts. All these recent murders, and the great disorder that accompanies them, leave no respite to the criminal brigade of the region. In particular to Laura and Vincent, two young police officers appointed to create an anti-criminal unit. They are very close, and care about each other as much as they do about their work. Laura is a lovely young woman. His passion for his work as a policeman is matched only by his love of the human race. Vincent is a sexy young man. His devotion leads him to clean up this too often corrupt \"paradise\". And, although he denies it, he is very attracted to Laura.",
