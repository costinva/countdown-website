  "overview": "Pet Vet Dream Team follows talented veterinarians Dr. Lisa Chimes and Dr. Andrew Marchevsky of the Small Animal Specialist Hospital (SASH), where they deal with compelling cases of ailing and injured pets. Viewers also see exotic animal expert Tim Faulkner in action at the Australian Reptile Park, where he cares for animals big and small, from crocodiles to koalas. Together, these three authorities race to cure their furry and feathered chargesâ€”educating viewers on a range of medical procedures and zoological practices along the way. As viewers catch a behind-the-scenes look at the veterinary profession, they also learn responsibility and empathy for animals of all kinds through the passionate work of the Pet Vet Dream Team. ",
