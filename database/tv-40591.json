  "overview": "Lazy Boy Garage follows three best friends into the world of international car ‘flipping' – where cars are quickly resold for profit in Stamford, Lincolnshire. Dubbed ‘lazy boys' because they don't leave the garage, motoring journalists Jonny Smith and Tom ‘Wookie' Ford, and garage owner Tim Glover, hunt down classic car wrecks from across the world to do up and sell to international buyers. The team rely on social media and a network of international fixers to aid them in their hunt for valuable vehicles.From Ford Cortina's preserved in the Spanish heat to Russian camper vans in Vladivostok, the Lazy Boy Garage will stop at nothing to discover the best hidden motors on the globe, but every buy carries a risk. Complicated logistics, unreliable car quality and unexpected costs leave the team nervously awaiting the arrival of their new buy as it's shipped thousands of miles, wondering ‘Is it rust… or gold dust?'.",
