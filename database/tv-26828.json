  "overview": "Devon and Cornwall Cops is a documentary series about the work of the Devon and Cornwall Police. With their stunning beaches, picturesque villages, breathtaking landscapes and bustling towns, the two counties have the largest and most diverse police force in England. Their patch extends 180 miles from the border with Somerset and Dorset in the east to the Isles of Scilly in the west. Policing an area of this size offers many challenges and enforcing the law over the Great British summer break promises to be anything but a holiday.",
