  "overview": "Heaven's Gate: The Cult of CultsÂ is a thorough examination of the infamous UFO cult through the eyes of its former members and loved ones. This four-part docuseries uses never-before-seen footage and first-person accounts to explore \"the cult of cults\" that shocked the nation with its out-of-this-world beliefs. What started in 1975 with the disappearance of 20 people from a small town in Oregon ended in 1997 with the largest suicide on U.S. soil and changed the face of modern New Age religion forever. The 39 members of Heaven's Gate who died by suicide believed their souls would \"graduate\" to an alien spacecraft behind the Hale-Bopp Comet.",
