  "overview": "Ice Vikings takes viewers inside a world never before seen on television: Lake Winnipeg's commercial ice fishing industry, where descendants of Icelandic Vikings race against time and weather to bring their catch to shore before the ice gives way. These unique, brave women and men face blizzards, cracking ice and danger from every side as they use traditional ice fishing methods learned from their ancestors: Icelandic Vikings who settled near Lake Winnipeg more than 150 years ago. Ice fishing is one of the most dangerous professions in the world, in one of the most unpredictable work environments on the planet: Lake Winnipeg. With big money at stake (commercial fishing is a $25 million a year industry in Manitoba), and more than 700 people each year setting out on the ice every winter, these ice vikings put their life on the line for every fish and paycheck.Â ",
