  "overview": "After a bad breakup, 27-year-old Cam seeks out the one person who always makes her feel good: Lil Wayne. Cam enlists her three best friends, all equally devoted to Weezy and equally challenged by adulthood, to join her on an epic road trip to see his last concert. The trip's many unexpected turns force the women to rely on their friendship -- and gas station wine -- to get them through it.",
