These bizarre and chaotic roommates, including characters such as the Neanderthal Urs, the Roman legionnaire Claudius, the Countess Adelheid, the feminist maid Griet, the insurance salesman Joachim, the teacher Svenni and the love-hungry poet Friedrich Dorn come from different eras and cause quite a stir in the couple's lives.",
