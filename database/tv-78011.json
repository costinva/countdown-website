  "overview": "It's no secret that people make mistakes. Every person involved in the production of a film can also make a mistake. The screenwriter will add a dubious fact to the plot; the cameraman will not notice the dangling microphone in the frame. Between shots, the actor suddenly changed his clothes - thanks to the editor and continuity. How many of these errors fit in one film? One or two? Oh if only!Especially for you, the creators of KinoFail took a closer look at the smallest details in the frame, and prepared video reports on blunders in well-known films.",
