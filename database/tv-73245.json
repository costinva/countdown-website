  "overview": "With his enthusiasm for learning new things and his 6'5', 250 pounds of questionably athletic mass, Paddy O'Connell is like an average, everyday outdoor enthusiast who's been inflated way beyond average, standard size. This show pairs him with coaches and mentors from different sports and activities, at which it's doubtful he'll excel, in a celebration of the one thing we can all relate to being a beginner.",
