  "overview": "Who casts spells on celebrities? Why do the most exemplary families collapse after 20 years of marriage and is it possible to protect yourself from the evil eye? Where are the sources of strength and why do so-called \"black spots\" literally attract people to them? How long does the curse last and how can I get rid of it?Viewers will learn about settlements whose residents are terrified to leave their homes because they believe that everything around them is infested with ghosts. About generations of people who, for decades, cannot remove the curse from their family. About houses standing on fissures leading to the other world.The expulsion of demons and crimes covered in mystery, the search for the living and the unsolved signs of the dead - the documentary-mystical project \"The Dark Side\" will tell about this.",
