  "overview": "Natural Born Killer is the definitive story of how the police stopped a serial killer in his tracks. School janitor Vincent Stanford was on his way to becoming Australia's worst serial killer, following the brutal murder of bride-to-be Stephanie Scott, and a range of plans to murder many others. Even more shocking is the theory that Vincent most likely practised his murderous craft in Europe for 20 years prior.This is the story of his conviction, his chilling confession, his possible involvement in other cases, and how he almost got away with it due to the DNA confusion with his identical twin brother.",
