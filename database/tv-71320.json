  "overview": "Did you know you can read Jesus's Sermon on the Mount in about 18 minutes? Yet packed into this short talk are more life-changing and startlingly original teachings than anywhere else in Scripture. In it, Jesus dives past the surface into the heart of what we need and desire--from God, ourselves, and one another. It's the spiritual straight talk we need about the things that matter most in life.",
