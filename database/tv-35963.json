  "overview": "At Stovner in Oslo is the small housing team Tangerudbakken located. It is an ordinary - and somewhat unusual - housing team. Here are six people with different developmental impairments. They own their own apartments and manage for the most part themselves, but have access to help if they need it. In the series Tangerudbakken Borettslag we follow the lives of residents for half a year.",
