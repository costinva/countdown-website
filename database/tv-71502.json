  "overview": "The Enfield Poltergeist tells the riveting story of the most famous poltergeist haunting in history. Combining more than 250 hours of rare audio archive, meticulous recreation of the setting of the haunting and original interviews with the people impacted by the case, the series is an ambitious, genre-bending story that explores the human fascination with the unexplained and its impact on those who live it.Â In 1977, the terrifying haunting of an everyday family in Enfield, London dominated headlines across the United Kingdom and had a tremendous impact on an entire generation of children. The mysterious case forever changed ideas about the supernatural, and showed that it wasn't just restricted to certain places but could be experienced by anyone, anywhere. The chilling story inspired fictionalized versions of the case, including the film \"The Conjuring 2,\" a television series and a stage play.",
