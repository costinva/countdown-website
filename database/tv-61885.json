  "overview": "In Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend, five new Iron Chefs will compete against Challenger Chefs in the grandiose Kitchen Stadium. According to the official synopsis, \"The competition's most successful Challenger will return to battle in a grand finale for the chance to be named the first ever â€˜Iron Legend.'\" Alton Brown returns as a host alongside Top Chef Season 10 winner Kristen Kish. Mark Dacascos is back as well, hopefully to shout out the secret ingredients this time around, too. And here's hoping that there's at least one cameo featuring original Iron Chef host Takeshi Kaga taking a big ol' bite out of a bell pepper.",
