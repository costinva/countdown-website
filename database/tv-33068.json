  "overview": "Southern Belles: Louisville follows the lives of five single, modern Southern women in their 20s and 30s in the heart of Louisville, Kentucky, offering an intimate look at the professional and romantic lives of this circle of friends. Southern Belles: Louisville is a real-life \"Sex and the City\" that takes place in the South, but not the South that stereotypes are made of. The backdrop is the progressive, art-centric and warm community of Louisville, Kentucky. The series will showcase the intense friendships and family values that are part of the Southern way of life. These five contemporary and independent women are all at critical crossroads in their lives: Some are confronting their biological clocks, some are still looking for Mr. Right and are trying to find their career paths, and one is preparing for her wedding.",
