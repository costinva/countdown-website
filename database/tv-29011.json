  "overview": "Wittekerke is a long running soap about life in an imaginary Flemish North Sea coast resort of that name. During 15 years many characters appear and most disappear sooner or later. Fairly constant elements are: the hospital, a hotel and the municipal police force, their staff, family and love-life. The last season focuses on serious crime.",
