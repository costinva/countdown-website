  "overview": "Dogs may get credit for being humanity's best friend, but to many people cats are just as much our loyal partners â€” even though if you asked cats they might not admit it! Cat People explores our fascinating relationship with cats through the lens of some of the most remarkable and surprising \"cat people\" in the world, defying the negative stereotypes of what it means to be a cat person while revealing the fundamental truths of what it means to have deep bonds with these fiercely independent, mysterious creatures.",
