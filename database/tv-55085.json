  "overview": "Love &amp; Death tells the unbelievable true story of Candy Montgomery, a 1980s Texas housewife accused of murder. Despite a loving family, a picture-perfect home, and an active presence at church, Candy is unable to shake her sense of suburban ennui. After an unexpectedly charged moment with fellow church member Allan Gore, Candy finds just the risk-taking thrill that's been missing from her life. Their ensuing, meticulously strategized affair unfolds mostly as planned – until their respective spouses, Pat and Betty, each discover their secret… and someone picks up an axe.",
