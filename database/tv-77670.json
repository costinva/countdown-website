  "overview": "A music and game TV show in which two teams compete: stars and participants. The first team consists of famous musicians, actors, presenters, composers and comedians, the second team includes TV viewers from different cities of Russia who love to sing, and not necessarily well. Participants perform musical numbers, which were carefully prepared in advance with experienced trainers and teachers. At the same time, they \"sing\" in other people's voices, to a soundtrack, hiding their real vocal abilities. The stars' task is to guess the participants who are deaf and cannot sing at all. Each episode features 18 viewers and four stars. Over the course of three rounds, both teams try to win one million rubles.",
