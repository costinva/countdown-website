  "overview": "Italian cuisine is so much more than pizza and pasta â€“ but there's still lots of tasty pasta in Bonacini's Italy. Famed Chef Michael Bonacini cooks his way through 15 Italian regions, exploring the flavours and textures that make these areas unique. Each episode takes us through an entire meal from one region, from antipasto, soup, or salad, to delicious primo, succulent secondo, and even sometimes a decadent dolce. Set in a warm, contemporary kitchen, Michael shows viewers how to make sumptuous Italian fare.",
