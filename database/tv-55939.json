  "overview": "In the ultimate test of their taste buds, talented chefs, restaurant critics, cookbook authors and amateur home cooks are vying to win $50,000 in the new high-stakes show. Competitors showcase their impressive palates in a series of increasingly complex tasting challenges that push their senses and culinary knowledge to the limits. With each dish dramatically revealed under a cloche, the action begins with 60 seconds of rapid-fire tastings where the competitors must identify specific ingredients, then proceed to the main-course round where the challenges become more difficult with every reveal. Each episode has two guest panelists, who are available to provide \"flavor favors\" â€” limited lifelines to competitors. In the end, only those that survive through the final tasting are awarded $50,000.",
