  "overview": "How would you survive inside the justice system if you were convicted of a crime that you did not commit? TV One's Evidence of Innocence spotlights the unbelievable true stories of four people who endured this life-altering nightmare - innocent of crimes for which they were arrested and ultimately imprisoned. Hosted by acclaimed civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, each one-hour episode of Evidence of Innocence focuses on one wrongfully convicted man or woman - Lisa Roberts, Richard Miles, Melonie Ware and Mark Schand - each faced with the enormous challenge of maintaining faith while awaiting the opportunity to prove their innocence. Locked in cells for years upon years, wrestling with fear, maddening loneliness, suicide-inducing despair, these survivors who somehow endured the struggle to have their cases overturned and regain their freedom, share their riveting accounts with Attorney Crump.",
