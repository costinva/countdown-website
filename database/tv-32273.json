  "overview": "On Wild Ops, veterinary medicine meets Delta Force intensity. A crack team of veterinarians, muggers and pilots attempt to capture, study and relocate wild animals. Utilizing helicopters, snowmobiles, ATVs, radio-collars, dart guns, ropes, nets, hobbles and mobile ER units, these wildlife wranglers chase a wide variety of wildlife: deer, moose, elk, wolves, pronghorn, and bighorn sheep, to name a few. Once captured, the Wild Ops team administers necessary medicines and tracking devices to ensure the health of the individual animal and the entire species for generations to come.",
