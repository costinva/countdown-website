  "overview": "Duan Ruonan and Fan Xiaowei were once inseparable friends. When Xiaowei was betrayed by her scumbag boyfriend, Ruonan brought her to live with her and her boyfriend. Little did she know that the three of them living together would lead to a taboo romance between Xiaowei and Ruonan's boyfriend, Li Xiao. They carried on a secret affair behind Ruonan's back, until their emotional entanglements finally surfaced on Ruonan and Li Xiao's anniversary. Their once close friendship quickly turned sour, and Ruonan left heartbroken. However, their joy was short-lived. As the passion between Li Xiao and Xiaowei faded, Xiaowei's extreme lack of security began to manifest as near-obsessive control over Li Xiao, leaving him feeling suffocated. In an unexpected twist of fate, Ruonan and Li Xiao met again, and the three of them were once again intertwined. Tired of Xiaowei's control, Li Xiao rekindled his old feelings for Ruonan and broke up with Xiaowei. Xiaowei blamed everything on Ruonan and joined Ruonan's new company to plot her revenge.",
