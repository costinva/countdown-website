  "overview": "The Marie-Labrecque School is a unique institution that welcomes sixty young girls aged 12 to 17, all pregnant or young mothers. The school has the dual mission of ensuring their schooling and preparing them to assume their role of mother so that they are able to take care of the fragile and totally dependent little thing that they have put or that they will give birth. Nothing is less sure! This is a major challenge that needs to be addressed in a few months.",
