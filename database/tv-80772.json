  "overview": "Out of hundreds of applicants from all over the country, only 16 people made it to Startuppers. Some have invented an engine, some have an idea to open an atypical theater, others dream of winning the hearts of viewers with their culinary startups, and some want to become a producer of their own music label. The Startuppers show will show whose projects will see the light of day, and who will turn the page with a business idea.The participants will have to fight for a meeting with investors ready to help develop the brightest startup project! In the meantime: creative tests for stress resistance and business acumen, overcoming oneself, meetings with star guests, master classes, competitive struggle, the bitterness of defeats and the taste of the first victories.",
