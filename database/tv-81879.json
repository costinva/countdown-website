  "overview": "Agnetha Lakshmi Pfeiffer has a whole lot of problems on her hands: Because of her shopping addiction, the bailiff is now after her. She takes the bull by the horns and because she doesn't know where to go, she sets off on a journey that she has been avoiding for the past few weeks: her mother Naina Zareen Pfeiffer has died. She hasn't had a relationship with her mother, a former Bhagwan follower, for many years.",
