  "overview": "Betty Boop is an animated cartoon character. She originally appeared in the Talkartoon and Betty Boop film series. She has also been featured in comic strips and mass merchandising. A caricature of a Jazz age flapper, Betty Boop wore a revealing dress that displayed her curvaceous figure. Despite having been toned down in the mid-1930s as a result of the Hays Code to appear more demure, she became one of the best-known and popular cartoon characters in the world.",
