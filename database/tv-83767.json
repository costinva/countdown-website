  "overview": "Major Anastasia Yasynska, a principled, determined, and unwavering leader, takes charge of an investigative team where she must work alongside Captain Kyrylo Starley. He is her complete opposite—charming, witty, and used to following his intuition. Together, they tackle the most intricate cases, but the more they work side by side, the stronger the tension between them grows, gradually turning into something more. Their methods differ, their personalities clash, and their emotions become increasingly complicated. Every case presents a new challenge, and every investigation brings them one step closer to their fate.",
