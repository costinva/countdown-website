  "overview": "Camp Getaway follows the staff of the ultimate adult playground, as they navigate the challenges and surprises that accompany working for a camp that offers a non-stop good time. Looking to escape the stress of the mundane work week, guests head to Camp Getaway seeking adventure, relaxation and endless happy hours. The upstairs and downstairs worlds collide as the staff live, love and work together, while tending to the ever-changing eccentric and outrageous wishes of their demanding summer camp guests. Though each staff member brings a different level of experience to the table, they all share a love for this lifestyle that enables them to let loose on the weekends... and not always after the guests leave.",
