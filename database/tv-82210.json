  "overview": "London, 1851. The industrial revolution is changing the city. Bringing vivid colour in amongst the dirty red bricks and smoke stacks of the noisy bustling streets are four young, thrill-seeking, outspoken and audaciously creative mavericks John Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt and Thomas Woolner otherwise known as the Brotherhood. Championed by the most famous art critic of the time, John Ruskin, the artists are also joined by sassy, sexy model Lizzie Siddal. Their quest for artistic immortality takes them into some of the most debauched, darkest and liveliest corners of the city.",
