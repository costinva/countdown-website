  "overview": "Long before the Internet escaped from the lab, connecting the planet and redefining what it meant to meant to be a computer user... ...there was a brave and pioneering band of hobbyists who spent their time, money and sanity setting up their home computers and phone lines to welcome anyone who called. By using a modem, anyone who knew the phone number of these machines could connect to them, leave messages, play games, send and receive files in a virtual community... and millions did. They called these places \"Bulletin Board Systems\", or BBSes. Their collections of messages, rants thoughts and dreams became the way that an entire generation learned about being online.Â ",
