  "overview": "The Hayashidas were a typical happy family of father, mother, two boys and two girls. Until it all changed suddenly with the untimely death of the father, Shinpei. While still mourning his passing, the children are hit by another bit of shocking news from their mother \"Truth isâ€¦ I'm pregnant.\" The news of their mother's pregnancy at 51 sets into motion a new series of challenges for the four children, particularly for the eldest sister, Manami, who now becomes the family patriarch forced to struggle with the pressures and responsibilities of \"child rearing\" and \"family ties\", not to mention greater philosophical questions about the meaning of life. A moving, life-sized human drama.",
