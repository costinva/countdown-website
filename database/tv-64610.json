  "overview": "A newly retired postman from a small town, Mietek Zasada, has to take care of the burial of Czeslaw's friend when the only funeral home in the area refuses to provide the service. Unaware of the obstacles and absurdities of funeral business, he sets up his own company and soon has to balance on the verge of legal regulations and moral principles. He also quickly comes into conflict with the local industry tycoon, and he can only count on the support of the eccentric daughter of a deceased friend and his disabled wife. When, in addition, dark secrets from the ex-postman's past begin to emerge, the world around him and his relatives begins to change irretrievably.",
