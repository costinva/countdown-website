  "overview": "The 13th Century St. Ogg's Cathedral is home to Bishop Hubert Cleaver and his support staff: Henry, the Archdeacon is prone to a tipple, whilst the Rev. Mervyn Noote, as his chaplain, provides support in his own naive, bumbling manner. Their life would be a fairly cosy affair if it were not for the officious Dean, Lionel Pugh Critchley, who never tires of telling the Bishop where he is going wrong.",
