The proportion of female police officers in England and Wales has increased from 7% in 1977 to 29% in 2017 but men still dominate senior positions by over 80%.From the Chief Constable to officers on the frontline, each episode is based around the unfolding stories of three women on the Force across a single, gripping shift. The Shift: Women on the Force offers a rare glimpse into the extraordinary demands this job can place on their lives - on duty and at home.",
