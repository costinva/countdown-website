  "overview": "Philippe is a top pianist. Obsessive and a perfectionist, he works hard to prepare a series of concerts at the Strasbourg Opera. His world, hitherto tidy and orderly, is cracking the day of his forty years. More and more violent tinnitus and strange visions are starting to disturb him. He is the only one to hear false notes on his piano. Without being able to control anything, Philippe is switching to another world... A world governed by his fears, his anxieties and especially by a deep trauma he repressed more than 30 years ago, when he was still a little boy ... Is he really falling into another reality, or is he just the unfortunate victim of his paranoid delirium?",
