  "overview": "In this brand new documentary series the inimitable Miriam Margolyes embarks on an epic road trip through the heartlands of Middle America, with her unique mix of charm, cheek and curiosity.Miriam is heading almost a thousand miles from Chicago to New Orleans - and along the way meeting the people whose voices and votes are reshaping the nation. From summer camps to county jails, all-girl motorbike gangs to a mass citizenship ceremony, the articulate, funny and refreshingly honest Miriam embeds herself in communities whose visions of their own country challenge everything she thought she knew about America.",
