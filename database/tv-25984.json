  "overview": "Cha Jin Wook is the son of a wealthy family who runs a large firm. He is known to pursue short term love only, but he is changing when he is crossing paths with Lee Yoo Mi. They both end up having an one-night stand together in a dating world of busy people who tend to flirt and chase ''certain'' relationships rather than a connection in which they are allowed to show their true feelings. Once they meet again three years later, they kick off a shaky push-pull romance which will keep them both on their toes as they slowly fall in love.",
