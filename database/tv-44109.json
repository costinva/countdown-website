  "overview": "The Amelia Gething Complex presents online sensation Amelia Gething, in this female-led comedy sketch show which harnesses her aspirational style and surreal humour. Amelia lives in a flat with her two best friends, Vinny and Poppy. It's a home like any other, except that anything can happen. Interspersing the madcap antics in the flat, the show spins off into other sketches in the outside world and breaks the fourth wall by directly engaging the audience.",
