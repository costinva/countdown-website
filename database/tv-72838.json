  "overview": "In each episode, two stars compete with each other to find out who of them will see \"Congratulations, you sing great\" on the screen at karaoke, and who will come there just to watch a video with animals and mountains.And eight strangers will help them with this. They all sing, one way or another. It's just that some people do it professionally, while others do it crookedly, but with soul. They are united by a love of karaoke, and only the score counter will judge.",
