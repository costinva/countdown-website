  "overview": "Paris, November 1897. In just a few minutes, a devastating fire destroys the Bazar de la Charité, a building that houses a very popular charity event, leaving more than 130 dead, mainly high society women and their entourages.Three women – Adrienne de Lenverpre, Alice de Jeansin and Rose Rivière, her maid – see their destinies turned upside down. Identity theft, forbidden love, radical life change, betrayal, emancipation: Le Bazar de la Charité plunges us into Parisian society at the end of the 19th century, as we follow the romantic destiny of its three heroines.",
