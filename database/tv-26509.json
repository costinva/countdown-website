  "overview": "Swamp Hunters follows the Taylor clan, a group of burly, loud and proud rednecks, who hunt for relics in the swamps around their home in Southern Mississippi. Their swampy hunting grounds are loaded with valuable finds from the days of the pirates, the civil war, and voodoo ceremonies, and each episode finds the Taylors braving snakes, boars, gators and rival relic hunters in the quest for historic finds that could land them big money.",
