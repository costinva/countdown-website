  "overview": "Fear has a sound and Xtreme Screams will ensure that thrill-seekers' screams - heard at exhilarating rides, attractions and experiences around the world - will reverberate in viewers' ears long after they watch each heart-pumping episode. From Colorado's Terror-Dactyl, which launches riders 100 mph over Manitou Springs, to a heart-pounding jump off the 260-foot-high Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, South Africa, one thing each adventure has in common is the ear-piercing shrieks coming from those brave enough to try it!",
