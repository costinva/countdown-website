  "overview": "Owing to a certain incident in her past, Reiko Kuki knows the value of money better than anyone. Thrifty with her spending, this poor, \"around-thirty company woman meets Keita Saruwatari, the moronic president's son and profligate spendthrift with no memory at all of how he spends his dough. When these two polar opposites spend a summer learning about money management with a bunch of other financially-quirky people, personalities and values clash to produce some unexpected comedy and romance.",
