  "overview": "The Great British Photography Challenge follows world-famous photographer Rankin as he mentors the contestants, providing a unique masterclass in the art and craft of photography. Every shot counts as Rankin's ‘students' build up to the task of creating and presenting a portfolio of their work, to be revealed at a climatic exhibition in the final episode. Although a winner is ultimately chosen, no-one is eliminated from the series, which takes a nurturing approach and embraces different perspectives as we follow all six throughout the process.",
