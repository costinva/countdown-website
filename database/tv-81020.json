  "overview": "The Sing Sing Chronicles is a four-episode exposé built on two-decades of original investigative reporting with unprecedented access to one of America's most notorious prisons. Crafted from an archive of more than 1,000 hours of footage filmed from 2002 to present day, the series tells the story of a journalist and a man convicted of murder who begin as strangers but become like brothers. Their unlikely connection, forged in the cell blocks of Sing Sing Correctional Facility, ignites a search for justice in four unrelated homicide cases. ",
