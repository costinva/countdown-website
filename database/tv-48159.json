  "overview": "Suen Man Yee (Liza Wang) is highly regarded in the \"legal world,\" so she is temporarily appointed to be a judge. However, because of her husband's heart condition (played by Ha Yu) and her two daughters (Patricia Liu and Myolie Wu), she decides to give up her position as a respected lawyer to take care of her family. When Man Yee's law firm hires a new attorney, Ching Hok Kan (Sammul Chan), his attitude towards law is different from what is accepted, as he does not handle matters according to the \"book.\" This causes difficulties to Man Yee, but since she appreciates his sincere heart, she decides to train him to become a useful member of society.Â ",
