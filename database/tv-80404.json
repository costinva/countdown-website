  "overview": "It's in the Game: Madden NFL reveals the never-been-told story of Madden NFL, from its archaic 8-bit origins to its success as an annual must have—against all odds.  For the first time ever, EA SPORTS is opening their vault of rare and never-been-seen footage, while also allowing cameras to follow along as the team finishes the next generation of the game. What started as an unlikely pairing between a computer whiz and a football legend, ignited a revolution and triggered a seismic collision between the worlds of jocks and geeks. They should have failed. Instead, their game changed the game—and our culture, too.",
