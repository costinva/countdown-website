  "overview": "Em Casa com os Gil follows one of the most famous families in Brazilian music during the creation of an unprecedented concert, which will bring together all generations of the Gils on stage for the first time. They've met for a creative retreat in the countryside of Rio de Janeiro. The cameras followed their daily lives, a never before seen interaction between the Gils, also Gilberto Gil's 80 years of life in preparation for the Europe tour. In addition to exclusive moments of intimacy, the retreat is also the center-stage for controversial discussions such as the diverse family background of the Gil family, racism in Brazil, the strong influence of Afro culture in society, among other topics â€“ all, of course, packed with songs that marked generations and the culture of Brazil.",
