  "overview": "The primitive era of human history can hardly be called a paradise like the biblical Eden. Instead of a quiet life, two tribes living along the banks of one wide river face severe danger every day. The Chief's tribe is losing ground due to the weakness and inexperience of their leader, who wants to be a friend to everyone. But the tribe of \"morons\" led by the Leader is at the peak of its strength and lives in prosperity. Therefore, one of the Leader's hunters runs away to his competitors, and the Leader's people joyfully accept him. But few of the savages understand what is really happening on the other side.",
