  "overview": "Summertime is the best time of year – the sun, the fun and especially the food! From fish tacos to lobster rolls and funnel cakes to elote, Beachside Brawl aims to find out which coast does summer food the best! Representing the west, acclaimed chef Brooke Williamson handpicks four premier beach chefs to put their skills to the test, while elite chef Tiffani Faison lines up her top picks to join the brawl and represent the eastern coast.  In this highly anticipated return to battle for these two TOC champs, both captains will cook alongside their teams and mentor them throughout the competition with one goal – prove that their coast does it best! Overseeing this beachside showdown, Antonia Lofaso, who was born in Long Island, NY and now lives in Venice, California, is the perfect host to preside over this battle for the best beach eats. Get ready for this delicious new competition just in time for summer!",
