  "overview": "Dara Ó Briain will be joined by archaeologist Raksha Dave and Egyptologist Dr Chris Naunton to explore the most compelling questions surrounding pyramids – 'How were they built using massive chunks of stone, so heavy that even today a modern crane would struggle?' or 'What were the Egyptian pyramid's true function?'; 'If, as Egyptologists suggest, they're tombs, why has no-one ever discovered a Pharaoh in any of them?'    They will also explore the more far-fetched theories surrounding the pyramids: Was one a giant power station? Were they built for, or even by, aliens? And the biggest mystery of all – why did the Ancient Egyptians start building them and then stop?    Debunking the many myths that encompass them, this definitive series will uncover the fascinating archaeological, historical, and scientific findings which tell the story of the Pyramids – revealing the secrets of these mega structures –- and will share eye-opening facts that will both surprise and captivate the audience.",
