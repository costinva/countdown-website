  "overview": "Picucha may seem old-fashioned, but she has modern ideas and a great sense of humor. At 85 years old, she pushes the limits of her age and does everything she can for her family and friends. Sweet Mother illustrates the everyday life of the elderly with clarity and levity, and shows that youth actually starts at 80. In the role that earned her the 2013 International Emmy® Awards for Best Actress, Fernanda Montenegro adds another success to her list of characters, which includes an Oscar nomination for the film Central Station.",
