  "overview": "Narrated by Nick Offerman, American Rock Stars follows John Shuster and his team of self-described \"scrappy regular guys from Middle America\" as they prepare to defend their gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics. The series, directed by Sports Emmy Award-winner Scott Boggins, goes behind the scenes with the team that stole the hearts of America in 2018 and rocketed the sport of curling to a new level of fame. Anchored by the team's captain, John Shuster, the series shows a new side to each of the team members - Matt Hamilton, Chris Plys and John Landsteiner - from their small-town roots all the way to the dramatic trials.",
