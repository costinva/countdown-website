  "overview": "This anything-can-happen competition will bring culinary matchups to the streets as chefs come together for outdoor cookoffs while the neighbors supply the goods. Eager chefs will try to convince the folks at home to open up their fridges and hand over their ingredients. Chefs can use anything they get â€” provided it fits into a single bin, that is. It'll be a one-and-done Kitchen Crash, as there's no guarantee contestants will find exactly what they're looking for AND there's no chance to restock throughout the competition.",
