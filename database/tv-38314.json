  "overview": "Grayson Perry explores the landmark events in all of our lives--Birth, Coming of Age, Marriage and Death. He works alongside people who are going through those universal experiences with the aim to try and reinvent these rites of passage so he can mark and celebrate them for modern secular Britain.In a major departure for Grayson, each episode sees him experiencing an extraordinary rite of passage in a number of worldwide societies â€“ journeys well outside his usual comfort zone. These include the beautiful and haunting birth ceremony in Bali, a visceral coming of age ceremony amongst the Tikuna people of the western Amazon, a traditional Shinto wedding in Urban Japan, and the unique death rituals of the Toraja people of Indonesian Sulawesi, involving mummified human corpses and buffalo sacrifice.",
