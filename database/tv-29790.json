  "overview": "Britain's landscape has changed dramatically over the last 50 years. Wild plants, bushes and trees have disappeared, and strange new plants have become familiar. Brand new six-part series, Wild Things, opens up a completely different view on the world around us. Along with one of the biggest British natural history projects ever undertaken, this series reveals how plants offer an understanding of changing British wildlife.Wild Things is presented by new faces - Royal Horticultural Society gold medallist and garden designer Chris Myers and his Labrador Lottie, and they are joined each week by one of Britain's top botanists Dr. Trevor Dines and Lichenologist Sally Eaton. From remote mountain tops to murky urban bogs, their wild plant hunts take them all over Britain as they attempt to unlock the secrets of the wild - often in the most unlikely places.",
