  "overview": "From humble beginnings rise four Fruit Ninjas to rediscover the long lost art of Juice Jitsu. Their mission â€“ to unlock hidden powers through the slicing of fruit and to protect their neighbours from bizarre villains they never knew existed! Running a juice stand as a front for the messiest secret service in the world, our ninjas grow to learn that it is what makes you unique (and even a little bit weird) that ultimately makes you strong.",
