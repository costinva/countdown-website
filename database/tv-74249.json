  "overview": "Katya, hiding from the problems that her brother \"threw\" at her, gets a job living in a mansion on Rublevka. In a huge estate, behind a high fence, oligarch Sergei gathers the whole family under one roof — his real, third wife and their children together, as well as two ex-wives and children from previous marriages, to announce to them that he is terminally ill and \"has not long to live.\"The ex-wives are already mentally dividing the inheritance, Katya gets closer to the eldest son of the owner of the mansion, Misha, who pretends to be an employee of the estate. His eldest daughter Olya, who is acutely worried about the forced return to Moscow from a warm country, finds support in the person of her new driver. And the numerous service staff not only watches the lives of amazingly rich people whose bags cost the same as their mortgages, but also does not stay away from a lot of intrigues.",
