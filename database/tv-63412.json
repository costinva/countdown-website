  "overview": "The drama tells the story of Han Ru Fei, a former idol who joined the archery team as an auditor, and becomes a disciple of Cai Jin Ye. Two people who did not like each other at first had to meet for any trifle, trying to get each other into trouble. During the time of communication, Han Ru Fei's company has become a powerful driving force supporting Cai Jin Ye's pursuit of dreams. Two hearts are constantly coming closer, and two unrelated arrows are trying to hit their own bullseye.",
