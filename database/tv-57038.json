  "overview": "A juicy four-part docuseries exploring the meteoric rise of tabloid media and the cut-throat players who blew up the news, Gossip digs deep into the ascent of Rupert Murdoch and America's insatiable appetite for dirt â€“ featuring The New York Post's Cindy Adams and a who's-who of insider interviews. Money, power, sex, fame: everything's fair game when celebrity scoops and society scandals move from the margins to the mainstream and column inches turn into currency that could destroy reputations or even make a President.",
