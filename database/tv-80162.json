  "overview": "Working 9 to 5 sucks. The corporate machine only gives us a weekend to really live, but how much can you do in just 64 hrs? Now, two athletes are on a mission to show us how to take back the weekend and BEAT MONDAY. Beat Monday is a series of epic weekend adventures designed to push the boundaries of what's possible between Friday night and Monday morning. Along the way, adventure athletes Mike Chambers and Jason Antin get into crazy situations, inspire the audience with their perseverance and discover local cultures outside our daily bubble.",
