  "overview": "Guillaume Lucchesi, in his thirties, thought he had drawn a line under the terrible tragedy which saw the two people he loved the most die: Sonia, his first love, and Fred, his brother. Ten years later, Judith, whose love has made his life worth living again, suddenly disappears during his mother's funeral. To find her, Guillaume will have to face all the truths that were hidden from him by his family and friends, as well as those that he'd long decided to ignore. For better, but mostly for worse.",
