And when weird things start happening, it becomes clear that he's also the mythic magical being the Trickster. What begins as an unnerving slow burn of strange events in Jared's already-messy life crescendos to an epic clash of magic, monsters and mayhem.Adapted from the Son of a Trickster trilogy of books by award-winning author Eden Robinson.",
