  "overview": "In 1995, after smuggler Lu Shaohua went bankrupt overnight, he discovered the huge profit potential of a new drug, methamphetamine, and became a drug manufacturer. At the same time, anti-drug police Lin Qiangfeng, after finishing his undercover mission, was transferred to the West Port City Narcotics Control Team to follow up on drug-related clues. Over the years, Lin Qiangfeng and his team were dedicated to the anti-drug campaign, while Lu Shaohua traveled both domestically and internationally, connected with various drug lords and became more and more ambitious. Ultimately, the anti-drug police represented by Lin Qiangfeng lived up to their mission and broke through Lu Shaohua's complicated drug-related conspiracy.",
