  "overview": "Ángela leads a seemingly idyllic life from the outside: she has two fantastic children, a charming husband and a spectacular house. However, this facade is a fraud and it costs more and more effort to maintain it. Angela is actually a woman abused by an obsessive husband who has convinced her that without him she would be nothing. Until one day Edu appears, an attractive young man who reveals surprising secrets to her and who is willing to help her by eliminating him from her life.",
