  "overview": "This is a healing journey of self-reconciliation. In the world of adults, the monotony of everyday life silently erodes the soul, between breaking down and recovering, wounds are stitched up and torn open repeatedly. Loneliness drifts through the bustling city, caught in the endless cycle of day and night, swallowed by a dense forest of steel and concrete, where neither light nor a sky of one's own can be found. Two souls, reflected in a rearview mirror, gradually shed their disguises and defenses, finding redemption and embracing each other in love. Reality and illusion intertwine, suspense and mystery weave together, and emotions and salvation coexist. Ultimately, the self is the way home. Looking at the world once more, one is no longer alone.",
