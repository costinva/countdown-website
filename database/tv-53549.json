  "overview": "Buford is a lazy bloodhound with a mournful bark and a sharp nose for solving mysteries who lives deep in Fenokee Swamp. He teams up with the teenage Boggs twins – Cindy Mae and Woody – and the trio solves confusing mysteries that baffle Sheriff Muletrain and his overeager, but dimwitted deputy Goofer McGee. Buford's abilities are expanded with ears that revolve like radar dishes, and his nose responds to clues like a Geiger counter.But Buford has two weaknesses: when the moon comes out, he howls his heart out (often at the most perilous moments) and he also has a running feud with a karate-whacking raccoon.",
