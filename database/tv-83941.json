  "overview": "Next Gen NYC follows a tangled web of friends raised in the spotlight — or at least close enough for good lighting — as they stumble into adulthood one brunch, breakup and spontaneous decision at a time. Whether stepping out of their parents' shadows or creating their own legacies from scratch, these twentysomethings are determined to conquer Manhattan — if they can figure out how to adult first. Together, they'll navigate friendships, careers and romance, proving that trouble runs on espresso martinis and questionable decisions. ",
