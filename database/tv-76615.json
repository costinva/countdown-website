  "overview": "The battle between righteousness and demons has lasted for a thousand years. The leader of the righteous sect, Sword Sovereign Feng Yue, and the demonic cult's Star Lord, Feng Xingtian, engage in a life-and-death duel. Meanwhile, their successors, Shen Shaoyou and Feng Lixue, form an unexpected friendship by chance. To protect his master, Shen Shaoyou accidentally pushes Lixue off a cliff. Lixue is rescued and taken away by Chong Hua, the strongest expert of the demonic cult. From that moment, their fates are rewritten—Lixue is destined to become the leader of the demonic cult, while Shen Shaoyou will rise as the righteous alliance's leader, setting them on an inevitable path to confrontation. Through countless trials and tribulations, they come to recognize each other's true hearts and ultimately stand together once more. Regardless of whether they hail from righteousness or evil, whether they grow up in celestial realms or demonic domains, one thing remains unchanged—their unwavering sense of justice and love.",
