  "overview": "Chris Webber's Full Court Pranks is a new hidden-camera series that features some of the nation's biggest athletes and sports celebrities playing elaborate -- but good-natured -- pranks on their most adoring fans. This ultimate fan experience gets the fans out of the stands and into hilariously awkward situations in the only show that lets everyday people get up close, personal and extremely uncomfortable with some of the biggest sports stars and celebrities in the world! Hosted by Webber, the series' first season will welcome special guests Rick Fox, Hope Solo, Nick Swisher, Candace Parker and more.",
