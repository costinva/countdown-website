  "overview": "A former negotiator at the BIS who has been sidelined, Antoine Clerc will reluctantly return to service when he finds himself taken hostage with his daughter in a bank. After handling the situation masterfully, he joins the RAID group led by Hélène Banier. First problem: everything opposes them, as much as he is open and over-empathetic, she is locked and psychorigid. Second problem: Antoine's life is a real shambles - three marriages, three divorces, three daughters and an intrusive father - and if he is an outstanding negotiator to resolve the most thorny crisis situations, on a daily basis he is totally overwhelmed by his family!",
