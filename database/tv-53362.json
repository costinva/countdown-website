  "overview": "Winsome W. Witch (whose character is also called \"Winnie\") is a friendly, yet somewhat inept, witch. Winnie's catch phrase when casting a spell was \"Ippity - Pippity - Pow!\" (when the magic spell conjures, the Jet Screamer entrance cue from The Jetsons, is heard). She often flies around on a broom that happens to be magically alive.",
