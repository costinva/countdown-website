  "overview": "Secret Prankster Nitro enlists the help of his teammates as they aim to pull off some epic pranks on their fellow competitors: will Bionic wear a bunny costume at a calendar shoot for April? Will Viper fall for a fake influencer's demands? And behind the scenes at the live Gladiators shows in Sheffield, there are even pranks on unsuspecting members of the public, as well as the Gladiators going head-to-head in games like Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Charades. And yes, of course they are just as competitive outside the Arena as they are in it!",
