  "overview": "Capi, a 12-year-old boy with a normal life, suffers from a terrible accident that causes him severe post-traumatic stress. No one seems to have more information: neither the school, his friends, nor his family can explain what has happened. However, the psychologist who treats him is willing to dive into his history and discover the reasons that have led him to this situation. Little by little, Capi begins to trust him and tells him that he has the power of invisibility, and that the terrible nightmares that lurk him every night have to do with the monsters and the dragon that haunt him. But in their history, they are not all threats. There is someone who does want to help you: a mysterious teacher, a newcomer to the institute, who will try by all means to make the invisible visible.",
