  "overview": "Overcompensating is a college-set ensemble comedy about the chaotic journey of Benny, a closeted former football player and homecoming king, as he becomes fast friends with Carmen, an outsider on a mission to fit in at all costs. Deeply funny and personal, the show explores the lengths to which we all overcompensate while finding out who we really are.",
