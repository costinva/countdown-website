  "overview": "Hair Goddess is TLC's exciting new series follows the big business and even bigger personality of Christina Oliva, the epitome of a self-made woman. Born and raised in Staten Island, Christina started her own hair extension company at only 18 years old, working out of her parents' garage. Within three years, she built a large enough clientele to upgrade to a little Staten Island salon of her own and eventually hire both of her sisters and her cousin to work for her. With the help of her family, Christina's now world-renowned hair extension empire is ready for the next level: a salon in the heart of Manhattan. Viewers will follow Christina and family as they deal with all the stresses of running a new salon, including the challenges of having a family business while balancing their personal lives.",
