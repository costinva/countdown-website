It is a series of explorations into the different periods of Indian history - political, social and cultural. It traces the crucial and significant landmarks in the evolution of the great Indian Civilization; a unique combination of multi-cultural, mu|tiâ€”religious and multi- ethnic communities constituting a pluralistic society unparalleled in the entire world. The episodes sometimes use the technique of a documentary, at other times drama, in their narratives.",
