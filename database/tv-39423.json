  "overview": "First-ever horror nature series, Dead by Dawn delivers captivating and excellent visuals and storytelling while audaciously leaning into classic horror folly and memorable, distinctive soundtracks alongside suspenseful nature stories that begin just before sunset and end just after sunrise. Each episode features wildlife in a different country, from Costa Rica to Indonesia to the swamps of the USA. Once the sun goes down, creatures of the night battle for survival. It's a countdown until dawn, and only the strongest and luckiest will live to see the sunrise. Warning: Be prepared to scream!",
