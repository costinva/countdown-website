  "overview": "In his #1 bestsellers, \"The 4-足Hour Workweek\", \"The 4足-Hour Body\" and \"The 4-足Hour Chef\", Tim Ferriss proposes radically counter-足intuitive solutions that take readers from zero to hero in minimal time. Newsweek calls him \"the world's best human guinea pig\", as he tests the extremes for the rest of us. He believes that nearly any skill can be \"hacked\" and learned in 1/100th the time most people expect... but can he do it in a matter of days? The Tim Ferriss Experiment (TFX) will push Ferriss to the breaking point as he attempts just that. In each episode, Tim will find the world's most unorthodox teachers and - together - demystify some of the world's coolest and most dangerous skills. Sometimes he'll succeed, and other times, he'll fail spectacularly while risking life and limb. Tim believes that there is the potential for greatness in everyone.",
