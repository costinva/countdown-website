  "overview": "Princess Diana's life was as dramatic as it was short-lived. She brought joy to billions. Her death sparked mass hysteria. In July 2021 she would have turned 60.Â Diana's Decades celebrates her life and achievements and shows how each era of her life encapsulated the spirit of the age and inspired profound social change. We speak to people who either knew her or whose lives crossed paths with Diana's to deliver the most intelligent analysis yet of her life and impact on the final decades of the 20th century.",
