  "overview": "The film industry is a world with too many variables. A film's success depends not only on actors and directors but on everything that happens behind the camera: endless fights between the screenwriters, mischief, love affairs, and money issues. Finally, the whole team gets together for a wrap party. They will not only drink champagne but tell each other everything they've been hiding. Love affairs come to an end and arguments die down while the director is trying to understand whether he managed to create something \"real\".",
