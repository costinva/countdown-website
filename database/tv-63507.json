  "overview": "Totally Completely Fine follows 20-something Vivian Cunningham, whose life is a mess. Last week she accidentally burnt down her brother's vegan food truck with a bacon-flavored vape and this week she's inherited her grandfather's coastal clifftop shack and is tasked with helping people who come too close to the edge. Strangely enough, they've responded to her chaotic, nihilistic brand of psychology. Maybe, just maybe, in saving these people, she'll slowly start to save herself?",
