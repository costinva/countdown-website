  "overview": "Crash Course Physics is set up to be supplemental if you're taking a class in the topic, or to give you an introduction if you're just naturally curious. They tend to go fast, but the beauty of putting these on YouTube is you can back up and watch it again and again to make sure you're grokking everything going on.",
