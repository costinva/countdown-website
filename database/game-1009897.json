  "overview": "After wrapping up the hit Amborettio, Wanech transformed his trusty C.A.N. into a cozy green-themed pub serving brew, burgers, fries, and wings. The place hums with synthwave tracks, punctuated by chiptune sound effects, giving it a playful retro vibe.In this top-down, casual cooking sim with arcade twists, you’ll serve hungry customers by cooking food in a unique way: as meals rain down the screen, hit the correct W, A, S, D keys in sequence to prepare each order. Master the rhythm of the kitchen and deliver every plate!Nobody really knows why Wanech traded adventure for appetizers—though rumor has it, it’s all to raise awareness for Amborettio. Whatever the reason, your mission is clear: keep the pub buzzing, the customers smiling, and the orders flowing!Music by Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio",
