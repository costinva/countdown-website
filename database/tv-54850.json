  "overview": "Nikita and Polina all started well: common interests, romance, rough sex. But after 3 years of marriage, love has disappeared: Nikita even in bed pays more attention to his phone than to his wife. Polina can't stand it and files for divorce. But after a few hours, he turns to his almost former spouse for help. It would seem that what can reconcile a couple on the verge of breaking up? Perhaps only the need to hide the corpse.",
