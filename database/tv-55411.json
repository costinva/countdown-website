  "overview": "\"THE SAN PEDRO BEACH BUMS* is what America needs more of-- zany fun, innocence and lots of laughs. This hour-long comedy features five colorful, likeable guys who find themselves involved in a variety of adventurous scrapes.The five young men — Buddy, Stuf, Dancer, Moose and Boychick — have been close friends since high school and today, equally share all their ups and downs. Somehow these five young heroes find themselves constantly confronting outrageous situations. Each situation, containing slapatick action and well-accented comedy, with heart along the way, hilariously snowballs towards a thoroughly rousing conclusion.",
