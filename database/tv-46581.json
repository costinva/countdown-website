  "overview": "14-year-old Holly's family is torn apart by her school essay detailing violence in the home. Dedicated social worker Lars is assigned to the case. Convinced by Holly's story, he places Holly and her seven-year-old brother, Theo, in foster care. However, when central family members – including Holly's stepfather – claim that the essay is nothing more than teenage rebellion, Lars's sense of certainty begins to fray at the edges. Are children always to be trusted? How much emotional turmoil can one family take? And who is really telling the truth?",
