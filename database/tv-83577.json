  "overview": "Bibaa &amp; Nicole: Murder in the Park, unravelling the story behind the shocking killings of sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, and the police misconduct that followed.  As the Covid lockdown began to ease in June 2020, a group of friends meet in a London park following Covid guidance to celebrate the birthday of 46-year-old Bibaa Henry. As darkness falls, the friends gradually leave the party, while sisters Bibaa and Nicole stay, dancing in the park. When they fail to return home, they are reported as missing, but their disappearance is not acted upon by the police and the search is left to friends and family. 36 crucial hours later, the bodies of Bibaa and Nicole are tragically found by Nicole's partner. Finally, the police take notice, but in a shocking development, the women's bodies are photographed and shared on social media by the police officers tasked with protecting the crime scene. Through moving interviews with the sisters' mother, Mina Smallman and the small group of family and friends at the centre of the search to find them, and insights from the murder detectives investigating the case, the series pieces together the sisters' final hours, the frantic hunt for a serial killer in the making, and the police misconduct that followed. With never-before-seen evidence and police recordings, the series offers a unique insight into the investigation, exposes the attitude behind the behaviour of the police, and examines the failures that left Bibaa and Nicole's loved ones fighting for answers. ",
