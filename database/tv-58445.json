  "overview": "Nothing foreshadowed trouble on the day when Igor found out that his wife Natalia had died suddenly. He was left alone with two daughters and a lot of questions. Why did the mother-in-law drop the phrase that he might not be the father of the girls? Why did Natalia keep the second phone in secret? And how do you raise children if you've been missing from work before? Igor will have to balance between parental worries and a painful investigation. He even hires a private investigator to find out at any cost how his wife lived and died.",
