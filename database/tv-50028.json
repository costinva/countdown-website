The iconic hospital is located in the heart of Antwerp and has one of the largest and busiest emergency departments in the country with about 40,000 patients per year. Viewers dive into the lives of doctors, nurses and ambulance providers during their lifesaving job. The cameras move in the vehicles when the driver squeezes through busy traffic and has to drive through red lights.",
