  "overview": "Based off of Double Cross, which is a giant slot machine, it was revived a few years later as Bullseye. In the regular game two of the windows provides categories to select with the third window selecting the amount of questions in order to win the prize. If a Bullseye appears instead, they can play the category as much as they want to. They keep going until one of them wins the round. The Bonus Island includes cash, prizes, and more Bullseyes. Landing on a Bullseye stopped that slot from spinning. However, landing The Lightning Bolt meant the contestant lost The Bonus Island.",
