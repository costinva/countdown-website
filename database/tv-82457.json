  "overview": "Ed Bex is a man with an eating disorder: as soon as he puts something in his mouth, he sees what happened to it. He uses this special gift in his unusual job: with 'The Last Greeting' he helps relatives to reconstruct the last hours of their dearly deceased. When Inspector Adams finds a body in an airtight bag, he asks for Ed's help. Ed has doubts: does he want to use his gift in a murder case? When he does get stuck into the case, he becomes entangled in a mix of absurd situations, personal chaos and deep pangs of conscience.",
