  "overview": "In the untamed wilderness of Central Alberta, where seasonal wildfires can destroy a town in a single day, a special breed of firefighters risk their lives to serve and protect the people who live and work here. When the calls come in, day or night, they're always ready for the worst, and always ready to do their best. Hellfire Heroes follows two firefighting crews, led by Chief Jamie Coutts of Lesser Slave Lake and Chief Albert Bahri of Yellowhead County. Slave Lake firefighters include 19-year-old rookie Logan Skahl, Lt. Patrick McConnell, an expert in vehicle extrication, rope and confined space rescue, and Ryan Coutts, the Chief's son. The Yellowhead County crew features straight-talking Gabby Sundstrom, hard-charging Captain Corinne Grant, and â€˜speed-demon' Mike Toniak. No matter what comes their way, from battling a raging home fire, to Search and Rescue, saving lives on the most remote highways, or delivering a new life, no job is too big, or too small. Because they're Jacks of all Trades. And Masters of them All.",
