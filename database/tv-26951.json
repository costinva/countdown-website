  "overview": "All we carry on secrets, things we dare not tell even our closest. This can include everything from infidelity, abuse, lies, bullying, revenge, to sin, sickness and forbidden love. Secrets of throwing everything over. In Min hemlighet (My Secret) we tell stories from everyday life that are inspired by real events. We dramatize the Swedish people's confessions about events that changed their lives forever.",
