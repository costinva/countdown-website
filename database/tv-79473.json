  "overview": "Stranded on Honeymoon Island is no ordinary relationship show, it will fast track it all. Twelve unlucky-in-love singles will be matched into couples and then stranded on a deserted island. Isolated and pitted against the forces of nature, will true love blossom and surviveâ€¦or dive?In this bold and original new adventure dating format, six couples are matched by experts and then immediately after committing themselves to each other in an intimate ceremony, will be dramatically abandoned in idyllic isolation for the adventure of a lifetime.On these remote beaches, fledgling relationships are soon put to the test as the couples live together and fend for themselves with few resources. Marooned and alone, they must communicate and collaborate to get by, with nowhere to run when the going gets tough. Will an escape from modern life bring them closer together or push them apart? Will it lead to love or loathing?",
