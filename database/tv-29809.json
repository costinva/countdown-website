  "overview": "The One is the only hunting show of its kind in the outdoor industry. The show is the first show to blend the reality/personality based programming with real hunting! It tells the story of Mike Stroff's crew and all they do to get to that one opportunity, that one location or that one animal and all that they go through day to day working in the outdoor industry. The cast is a group of very unique individuals that will no doubt entertain to say the least.",
