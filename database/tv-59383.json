  "overview": "In the early 1950's, the American military presence begins in a small West German region. In this context, the story of friendship is told by two young women who try to find their place in this time of upheaval. In doing so, they have to struggle again and again with the old order, the conservative forces from politics, church and society. Also playing an important role is the love story with a black soldier, who experiences freedom for the first time in Germany, but has to struggle with racist hostility.",
