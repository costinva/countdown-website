  "overview": "The Misery Index is the only game show where contestants can make a fortune out of other people's mis-fortune. The game will feature two teams, each consisting of one contestant and two Tenderloins. Teams will compete in a game of stakes ranking hysterically miserable real-life experiences — from getting stuck overnight in an elevator to walking in on your grandparents having sex — on a scale of 1-100 based on our Misery Index, a ranking system created by a team of therapists.",
