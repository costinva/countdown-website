His leader is Chu Yun, who was quite prejudiced against him due to work misunderstandings. At first, Qi Lin did not cooperate well with the team. However, after experiencing the \"luxury car hit-and-run case\", \"divorce house vacation case\", \"shared bicycle deposit case\", \"college student naked loan case\", \"ten thousand tons of grain enforcement case\" and other work tempered, Qi Lin has become more and more interested in enforcement. He gained a profound understanding of the \"emotion, reason, and law\" in the novel, and gradually developed a love for Chu Yun. The Qinggang Intermediate People's Court decided to hand over the difficult problem of the development of the Global International Center, a key municipal project, the \"Changsheng Village vacation case\" to Chu Yun's team.",
