  "overview": "It's 2036 and Helgoland has become the last safe haven for humanity. A small community of survivors are entrenched on Germany's only deep-sea island following an apocalypse that has thrown the rest of the world into chaos. A totalitarian society is established, tolerating only 513 people on the island at any one time.The survivors trapped on the island have limited resources to share and an inhumane social-ranking system determines the lives of each of the 513 inhabitants. Helgoland's only doctor is high on the priority list, whilst others are far behind and have to fight for a better place and, their ultimate survival. But they face another threat from the outside. On the mainland, a group of rebels are preparing to conquer the island and disrupt the last safe place for mankind.",
