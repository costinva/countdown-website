  "overview": "Madison Penrose prepares for her sweet sixteen. She wants to have her birthday party at the Roller Dome, a once-popular roller skating rink with a violent history to match. She and her parents go so far as to hire a party planner. A few days before the party, while alone in the roller rink, the party planner hears a strange noise. The scene then flashes back to 1999, where Charlie Rotter is the owner and entertainer of the Roller Dome (he is known as \"Lord of the Rink\" and dresses in costume attire). One day, Rotter is humiliated by an ungrateful teenage boy named Craig, who slaps a cake out of Rotter's hands and rips his mask off in front of everybody, including his six-year-old daughter, Skye Rotter.",
