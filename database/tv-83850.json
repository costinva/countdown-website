  "overview": "Tim Rex in Space follows a Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex) named Tim, his big brother Tommy, little sister Tia and triceratops bestie Kai as they tackle kid-shaped adventures with dino-sized solutions in space. Tim and his family live in a unique world comprised of a cluster of asteroids that make up the town of Rumbleton. This intergalactic environment is a quintessential 21st century suburban town, with each asteroid hosting family homes, cafés, shops, parks, and even a beach. All asteroids are connected by a network of slides, ziplines and trampolines, but can also easily be reached on a quick rocket ride. ",
