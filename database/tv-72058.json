  "overview": "A fresh and zany look at our upside-down-world. Nick and Perry are two super mutts who crashland on Earth. And it looks like they are here to stay! Can they survive on a plant where dogs are only interested in biscuits and dinky toy balls? Nick and Perry find themselves in all sorts of hilarious situations as they try their best not to act like the free-thinking superior alien canines they really are.",
