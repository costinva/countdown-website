  "overview": "Listing Large follows the journey of Real Estate moguls and business partners Odeen Eccleston and Lamont Wiltshire as they juggle their growing real estate empire while dealing with the demands of parenthood, friendship, and their past romantic relationship. Eccleston and Wiltshire have been business partners for close to ten years, taking the Wiltshire Eccleston Group (WE) from a small venture run out of their cars to a nationally recognized success story. Now, during a very challenging market, they are launching a new brokerage, hiring new agents, and breaking ground on a number of high-end developments â€“ all while exploring what the future holds.",
