  "overview": "Hosted by model, designer and former college athlete Beija Marie Velez takes an unfiltered look into the unique perspective of women in sports today. Like a Girl features some of the most compelling, groundbreaking, and badass female athletes who are turning the phrase \"Like A Girl\" on its head. They're all genuine superstars but have often been left out of the spotlight… until now!  Velez dives in deep with pro-athletes, Olympians and champions to share their intimate, personal perspective on the issues they face on and off the field. Mental health, social stigmas, body image, reproductive issues, gender, and race inequality, it's all fair game.",
