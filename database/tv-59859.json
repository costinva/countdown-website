  "overview": "The Pruitts of Southampton revolves around the Pruitt family living in Long Island, who live like royalty in a huge mansion. Slight problem is that they are flat broke &amp; live off the state. Each episode involves Phyllis trying a new harebrained scheme to raise money and keep it from the IRS. As you can imagine, it all ends in utter chaos.Â ",
