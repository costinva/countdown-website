  "overview": "Guy Fieri brings together eight of the most renowned chefs in the culinary world to compete in the Flavortown Market for the very first time on Guy's Grocery Games: All-Star Invitational. Each week the chefs go head-to-head to see whose shopping and cooking skills are a cut above the rest. They must navigate their way through the grocery aisles as they are tested in challenges from \"Express Lane,\" where they must create a signature sandwich and side using only 8 ingredients, to \"Budget Battle,\" where they must make an impressive weeknight dinner for four with only $25, to \"Frozen Food Feud,\" where they must make a dish only using frozen ingredients, and many more. Ultimately, the food does the talking, as a rotating panel of judges determine who checks out of the competition.",
