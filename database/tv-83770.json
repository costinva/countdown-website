  "overview": "After eight years of studying at the St. Petersburg Medical University, Mitya returns to his native village of Ozernoye, somewhere in the vast south of Russia. His family, friends, and the whole village are waiting for him with pride and impatience, because special funds were spent on his studies, and a young doctor at the local hospital is also very much needed. But everyone is surprised to find out that Mitya is not a surgeon, dentist, or even a urologist, but a sex psychologist. Conservative residents do not accept Mitya, they call him a \"pussy doctor\", his own father threatens to recant, but Mitya does not give up. Because he knows how much help is needed for people who are not enlightened in sexual matters, who for generations have tabooed the topic of \"this very thing\" and live in a world of myths, superstitions and prejudices.",
