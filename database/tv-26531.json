  "overview": "In this TLC series Making it Home: Greensburg, hosts Doug Wilson and Faber Dewar will see firsthand that \"giving your neighbors a helping hand\" is not just a clich√©, it's a way of life, especially in a community destroyed by a tornado. While neighbors in Greensburg, KS, have always looked out for each other, the storm has brought them even closer. Now, with hard work and lots of emotional resolve, this close-knit community is rebuilding their town. The time has come to transform those new houses into homes, as six families come together to tackle home improvement and design projects in each other's homes. Their goal: to create a welcoming and safe home environment for one another, and to show the world what can be done when a community works together.",
