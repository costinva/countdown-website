  "overview": "Three sisters Olga, Maria and Irini around at the age of 45. Daughters of a judge, grown in one two-store house that now belongs to the youngest sister, Eirini. When Olga gets married and Maria does the same, they grow apart for about 20 years, until Olga gets widowed and Maria leaves her husband after his adultery. The sisters then, return to their family residence. The name \"Harites\" was taken partly from ancient Greek mythology (The Three Graces) and partly from their surname, which was \"Haritou\".",
