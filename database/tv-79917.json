  "overview": "A difficult period is coming in the relationship between architects Nadezhda and Andrey – financial instability, work problems, Andrey's sick mother, whose care requires money, as well as unsuccessful attempts to have a child.Adding fuel to the fire is the arrival of their successful classmate Kirill, Nadia's ex-boyfriend, who comes to their town to build a large shopping center. Kirill makes a tempting offer to the couple: Nadia – to head the company leading the construction, and Andrey – to become the chief designer of his project. They agree, unaware that Kirill has a plan for them: he is going to take revenge on Nadia, who 15 years ago chose another.",
