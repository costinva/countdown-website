  "overview": "These crimes were not written about in the newspapers, not talked about on the radio. Thousands of criminal cases are still classified as \"secret\". But it is time to penetrate the closed archives. Masterful swindlers, elusive thieves and even serial killers - they also existed in the Soviet era.

And what criminal secrets were ordered to be forgotten?",
