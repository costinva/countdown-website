  "overview": "Uspjeh (Success) is a multi-layered drama focused on strong characters. Three complete strangers will be tied together through a series of unfortunate events when they try to help an assault victim. As the consequences of their actions seep into every aspect of their lives, these everyday people of differing backgrounds decide to take back control of their lives. It is a bitter ode to the city of Zagreb which brings dark insight into various structures of today's society through the lives of ordinary people driven over the edge by that same society.",
