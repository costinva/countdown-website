  "overview": "Ad agency superstar Michael Davis has it all. He's a great provider and is proud of the restored farmhouse where his wife, Rachel, and their three kids live. But Michael has lost touch with his family. He gets a wake-up call when Rachel announces that she's leaving unless he reconnects with his family. Michael wants to earn back their love and trust, but he doesn't even know how the kitchen appliances work. When his boss and best friend, Jordan King, agrees to give him less work, Michael begins to define his success as a family man, not a businessman.",
