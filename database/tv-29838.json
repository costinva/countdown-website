  "overview": "The Split is an authentic, layered and witty exploration of modern marriage and the legacy of divorce through the lens of the Defoes - a family of female lawyers at the heart of London's fast-paced and emotionally-charged divorce circuit.Esteemed divorce lawyer Hannah quits the family firm when her mother Ruth, formidable personally and professionally, refuses her promotion. Landing at a rival firm alongside old flame Christie, Hannah navigates scandalous affairs, big-figure settlements and fraught relationship battles - coming head to head with Ruth and impulsive sister Nina in the bitter divorce of Goldie and multi-millionaire husband Davey. Meanwhile, the marriage of younger sister Rose looms on the horizon.When their estranged father returns after 30 years the sisters are forced to confront their past. Facing the reality of her dad's abandonment, and reconnecting with â€˜the one who got away' Christie, Hannah begins to question her relationships with the men in her life - including her seemingly contented marriage to the smart and affable Nathan.",
