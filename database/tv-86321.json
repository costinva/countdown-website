  "overview": "The series begins during the wake of the family's controversy and upheaval with Todd and Julie in federal prison and follows the family as their parents are eventually pardoned, released from prison and return home. The series shows a side of the Chrisleys that has never been seen before with exclusive access to the family—Julie and Todd from prison and upon their release, Savannah, Chase, Grayson, Chloe, Nanny Faye, and for the first time, Julie's parents Harvey and Pam. The new series exposes the raw truth of the Chrisley's lives—past and present—and the reality is far different from what audiences have seen before. The family faces a critical point that will either make their bond stronger or leave it shattered forever. This series delivers an unfiltered, deeply personal look at their journey and introduces the real Chrisleys as they navigate this new chapter.",
