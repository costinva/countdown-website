He and reporter teenagers Jenny Trent and Hoppy set out on a globetrotting adventure to travel around the world in 79 days and beat the original record set by Finny's father. The trio are in competition for both the record and a £1,000,000 prize against the sinister Crumden, who supposedly was the butler of the original Phineas. Crumden is aided by his idiotic chauffeur Bumbler and his pet monkey Smirky. ",
