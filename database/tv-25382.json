  "overview": "Obama: The Price of Hope is an intimate portrait of the Obama Administration, which had an indelible effect on the nation and world between 2008 and 2016. In this two-hour special, National Geographic examines the Obama years with unique insider access to the president and his inner circle, including frank interviews with Obama himself. From his 2008 electoral victory, the energetic Obama was determined to take on the challenges of governing an increasingly divided country. Obama: The Price of Hope focuses on both triumphs and roadblocks, including the stimulus bill, housing crisis, universal health care, the Arab Spring, and rise of the Tea Party. The filmmakers also depict Obama's mission to end gun violence, his commitment to racial justice and his passion to inspire a sense of hope against all odds.",
