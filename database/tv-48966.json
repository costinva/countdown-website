  "overview": "The brilliant comeback of the losers. The losers in life come back bringing out their long hidden abilities rather than giving up all hope in the face of failure. Under the conspiracy of Joo Ri and Mr. Hwang, new comers at Lala fashion, Kang To and Hae Won are transferred to the development department in which those waiting to be fired are temporarily placed. The love and courage of the employees in the development department who stand strong in the face of adversity is pictured with flashy success.Â ",
