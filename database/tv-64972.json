  "overview": "After losing her sight at the age of twelve, Blanca is one step away from fulfilling her lifelong dream: working in the police force. But once she arrives at the police station for an internship, she comes up against everyone's distrust. Thanks to the skills that she has developed over the years, however, and the help of her dog Linnaeus, she reveals Blanca as a detective with a different and effective \"look\". Based on the novels by Patrizia Rinaldi, \"Blanca\" is the first television series in the world shot in holophony, a special sound recording technique that allows you to be in the protagonist's place: hear how she hears and reconstructs the world.",
