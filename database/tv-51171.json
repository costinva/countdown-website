Years pass by and these two meet again. And the trick of fortune switches their situation and environments.

Now these two people are looking at the world with different eyes. The childlike girl has finally learned the harshness of the world and the guy with once twisted mind has learned to enjoy the latitude of mind. In the end, these two start to understand each other, thus arriving at the \"right time\".",
