  "overview": "Hundreds of years ago, the inhabitants of a pacific town were kidnapped by Siderno, a supreme, ruthless, deadly, villainous, lethal and evil minded lord of the Viruses, to be transported to four planets used as incubation machines, where they would be mutated into monstrous viruses in order to conquer the Earth. Today, the Earth is sick, pollution and human beings have allowed an invasion of viruses to arrive and spread. Each virus has different characteristics and super powers: they transform themselves, they multiply, they mutate and they fuse to become more powerful.",
