  "overview": "High school drop-out, lover of money and women, rude demeanor, and a vulgar mouth; Kuzu Motohito (aka \"scum lawyer\") will do just about anything if it means he can win in court. When Takeda Masami, a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer (who believes totally in justice) turns up at the office he is paired with Kuzu Motohito. The odd-pair fight court battles and learn about each other, their career and their own personal lives along the way! ",
