  "overview": "The \"Fashionable vs Folk\" project is based on a long-standing confrontation between two respected and beloved popular presenters - People's Artist Nadezhda Babkina and the famous Russian fashion expert Vladislav Lisovets. The heroes of the program find themselves in a studio, where they listen to accusations about their appearance from their friends or relatives, after which they first fall into the hands of \"folk\" stylists Nadezhda Babkina, and then to \"fashionable\" stylists Vladislav Lisovets.",
