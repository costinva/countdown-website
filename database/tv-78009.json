  "overview": "A dog has been man's best friend for several thousand years. It is not known exactly where and when people domesticated the dog. Most likely, this happened in southern Africa, where the oldest breed of dog, the Africanis, still lives.Probably no one knows the exact number of dog breeds in the world. More than 450 of them are officially registered. The host of the \"Planet of Dogs\" program, Grigory Manev, went on a trip around the world to different countries and continents to understand how and why chow-chows and chihuahuas, lapdogs and shepherd dogs, setters and spaniels, mastiffs and retrievers.Amazing canine geography: from China, Malta and France to Spain, Holland, Russia and South Africa. Grigory meets dogs everywhere and every time he is convinced that dogs and owners are very similar to each other, no matter where they live.",
