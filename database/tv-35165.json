  "overview": "David Ortiz, the one and only Big Papi, has jacked his last mammoth home run into the Fenway stands. He retired after the 2016 season as one of the most decorated and best-loved players in Red Sox history. Of course, if you know anything about Big Papi, you know the man isn't about to rest on his laurels. He's already going out of his mind—and he's driving his family nuts too! They all agree on one thing—this man was not built for a retirement made up of \"puttering\" around the house. He needs to find himself some gainful employment—and fast! Watch Big Papi as he seeks out new jobs and opportunities with hilarious and surprising results.",
