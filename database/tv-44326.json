  "overview": "\"We can laugh at everything, but not with everyone\" said Pierre Desproges at the time of the Tribunal des flagrants delirious. By creating for television The Necessary Minute of Monsieur Cyclopède, in 1982, because he does nothing between 8:33 p.m. and 8:35 p.m., he proves the opposite to the whole of France. Every night he divides the country into indignant fools and happy fools. History, doctors, democracy, science, death, racism, in one minute, he goes through various provocative subjects, with logical demonstrations but always based on the absurd. We find there his inimitable verve, his good words, his cynicism, but above all a devastating humor.",
