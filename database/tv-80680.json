  "overview": "A new dark h̶e̶r̶o̶ healer is born! He's no shadow doctor. He's a shadow healer who cures, comforts, and even rights the wrongs of the world...? \"You haven't done anything lately. To be honest, we don't need you anymore.\" When a young healer named Zenos is deemed \"useless\" by the party of adventurers, he is banished from the group with a single gold coin as severance pay. Born in the slums, Zenos practices self-taught healing magic without a healer's license. As he wanders the streets with nowhere to go, he comes across Lily, an elf girl who's on the verge of dying from a wound to her stomach. \"Don't worry, it's not that bad. You'll be fine.\" \"Huh? It doesn't hurt and the wound is gone! What did you do?!\" A quietly run clinic in an abandoned town at the very edge of the slums sets the stage for the fantastic tale of a brilliant unlicensed healer who has no idea just how powerful he truly is.",
