  "overview": "Pupi Poisson, Sharonne and Estrella Xtravaganza, guided by Supremme de Luxe, will tour various parts of Spain to give visibility to various LGTBIQ+ stories and show the realities of the group outside the big cities.Â On this road trip, the queens respond to the call of several people who have made a call for help: people related to the LGTBIQ+ community who need their support to transmit a message of diversity in their environment, in small towns in Spain. The arrival of the drag queens will be a surprise and a revolution for the locals, who will discover that, beyond the fact that the queens wear heels, dresses or wigs, they promote an artistic movement that stirs consciences and has values as important as integration , freedom of expression or self-love.",
