  "overview": "What happens when a couple has gotten so comfortable together, they finally decide to tie the knot but don't recognize themselves in the mirror? It's time for Say Yes: Wedding SOS which will focus on transforming couples who have let themselves go. From every-day life challenges including balancing kids and work and trying to keep that special spark alive, the couples featured on the show are in desperate need of a makeover for their special day. In each hour-long episode, style expert George Kotsiopoulos will work with the bride and groom and get them ready to walk down the aisle. From wardrobe and hair to veneers and tattoo removal, the couple will meet each other at the altar in front of their friends and family with a new look and, most importantly, renewed confidence as they head off into wedded bliss. Viewers will go along for the ride as they watch the couples go from drab to fab from custom suit fittings, liposuction, corrective eye surgery, microblading and laser hair removal, just to name a few.",
