  "overview": "Gareth Malone is taking eight untrained singers and staging his own performance of Bach's St John Passion on the 300th anniversary of its first performance.Â Putting his own twist on the performance, Gareth has invited people from all walks of life to apply. His only requirement was that they had a good voice but either very little or no experience singing in a classical choir. From a budding young singer from Port Talbot who found his voice through his drag act, to a flute-playing amateur footballer from Cardiff, the choir is made up of a variety of passionate singers.They may not have ever sung in a classical choir before, or have ever heard of J S Bach, let alone the St John Passion, but with Gareth's help, they will tackle this demanding choral work alongside the BBC Singers and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.",
