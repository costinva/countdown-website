  "overview": "A magnificent transatlantic ship full of passengers, travelling from Europe to South America in search of a better future. Two sisters, Carolina and Eva, as different as they are inseparable. A handsome officer, Nicolás Sala, a man that fate has put in the wrong place. A mystery to be solved: the murder of a passenger whose name does not appear in the passenger list and who no one remembers. Love, intrigues and many lies… in a ship that hides a story in each one of its cabins and a dark secret deep inside. There is only one clear thing: the murderer will not be able to leave the ship.",
