It's a place where our heroine, precocious five-year-old Maggie, has drawn a map where she takes her favorite stuffed toys, Hamilton Hocks and the Ferocious Beast. Maggie loves Beast and Hamilton so much that she has created a whole world for them to explore! Together, they climb the highest mountains, cross the widest deserts, and have tons of fun.",
