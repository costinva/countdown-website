  "overview": "Midori Akitsu (27 years old), ends up in another world after dying from overwork?! I got reincarnated in another world after God blessed me with a special ability. This ability is \"to be loved by non-human beings.\" Huh?! Meaning that humans might not like me, but all the fluffy animals will love me? Whoaaa! I get to pet a white tiger and dragons to my heart's content! After being reborn as NÃ©ma, the youngest daughter of a top class noble family, I'm doing my best for the survival of humanity while enjoying this world's fluffiness.",
