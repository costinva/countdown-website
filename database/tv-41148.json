  "overview": "Through the expert eyes of former FBI Tactical Instructor, Greg Shaffer, Body Cam: Behind the Badge unpacks the real-life decisions officers make to minimize harm to civilians - and themselves - while trying to bring dangerous suspects safely under control. The visceral Body Cam footage shows the tactics deployed by officers as they face deadly shooters, fugitives who use vehicles as weapons, and unpredictable and ruthless criminals. What are the tell-tale signs that warn officers that a suspect is a threat? How do officers assess the odds, and how do they choose whether to follow or ignore their training to protect themselves and innocent bystanders? Including new reflections from the officers who were profiled in Season 1 of Investigation Discovery's hit series Body Cam, as well as one new segment each episode pulled from the digital series Body Cam: Captured, Shaffer unpacks how officers respond to these unpredictable threats and how their training protects them and the public in moments of extreme danger.",
