  "overview": "In the new SAT.1 adventure show, ten candidates fight in breathtaking challenges across Argentina for up to 100,000 euros. The better they cooperate as a team, the greater the profit. But one of them is sabotaging the group in secret! The candidates only want to know one thing: who is playing wrong? Who is the saboteur? Who is - the mole? At the end of each episode they have to answer 20 questions about the traitor. Those who are least able to answer correctly have to leave the show immediately. Which candidate has the mole exposed in the final and who is the sole winner of the entire prize?",
