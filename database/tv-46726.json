  "overview": "The Architecture the Railways Built sees railway expert and train enthusiast Tim Dunn exploring the stunning architecture that lines the railway network. He visits stations made up of simple stone buildings, decorative Victorian grandeur, art deco masterpieces and striking glass and concrete structures created over the last few years. But Tim doesn't stop at stations. He's been given a platform to explore any structure which owes its existence to the railway: viaducts, signal boxes, tunnels, pedestrian passages, workshops, railway hotels: as well as less obvious buildings like homes, swimming pools and Turkish baths.",
