  "overview": "Join car addict Tyler Hoover as he makes his way across America buying the coolest, hardest to find cars at even harder to find prices. As soon as he scores, he puts his new ride to the test, on race tracks, off-road adventures and road trips through the heartland. Tyler then meets up with his mechanic \"The Wizard,\" to diagnose whether he bought a winner or a loser, and decide whether to keep the car or flip it.",
