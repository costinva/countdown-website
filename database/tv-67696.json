  "overview": "As in Douglas Adams' legendary novel, the knowledge series \"42 - The Answer to Almost Everything\" seeks answers to important questions about the universe and life. But in contrast to the supercomputer Deep Thought, it does not wait 7.5 million years for possible information. Instead, with the support of commentator Nora Tschirner, it takes just a few minutes to clarify, for example, whether we could dig our way through the globe or how much life on earth weighs.",
