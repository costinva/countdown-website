  "overview": "After meeting in their hometown of Portland, Oregon, Jinkx &amp; Liam quickly found they shared a twisted sense of humor and started writing sketches together in quarantine. Sketchy Queens is born out of their weirdest ideas, featuring celebrity impersonations, a revival of Jinkx's first Snatch Game character Little Edie, and hilarious (and humiliating) new material from this duo's wacky minds.",
