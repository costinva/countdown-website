  "overview": "The Filmmakers is a series that centers on a fun, candid studio conversation with some of the talents behind the greatest Canadian films of the past 20 years. Featuring a lively, diverse mix of personalities ranging from icons to experts to the next generation of filmmaking talent, we find out how eleven of the most significant Canadian films were made - and why we need to watch them.Hosted by film expert Johanna Schneller, the 11-episode show airs on Saturday nights throughout the summer. Each episode centers on one film that will then screen after the show. The films are a cross-section of Canada's most significant works, including Incendies (Denis Villeneuve), Water (Deepa Mehta), Stories We Tell (Sarah Polley), and I Killed My Mother (Xavier Dolan).",
