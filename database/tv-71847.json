  "overview": "A hard-working young woman in the new era wakes up and finds that she has transmigrated into a novel she stayed up reading all night. Fine, what's done is done except she's also in the body of a vicious supporting role.Now a character in a novel, the modern-day girl has to cope with having a traitor father and a playboy brother. What's worse, \"she\" has already done all sorts of bad things in the earlier parts of the story, so her intentions to ensure that her character stays alive till the end can only be described as a long and difficult road. Only after experiencing things firsthand does she realize that the heroine can easily capture one's smile without much effort. Let's see how the \"vicious\" supporting character without the heroine's halo and golden armor turn her pile of bad cards into a winning hand.",
