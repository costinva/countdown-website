  "overview": "A prestigious private high school has students who rank academically at the top of the nation. The school's student council president is Miyuki Shirogane, and their student council vice-president is Kaguya Shinomiya. They are attracted to each other but do not confess their feelings for each other due to their stubborn pride. About half a year has passed since they have kept their feelings private. Now, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya think the person who confesses first will be the loser. They both think of ways to make the other person confess first.This mini-series ties to live-action theatrical movie and was developed along with the second theatrical movie. It doesn't hold an actual full story, but rather bonus story with certain moments, the main story is told in the movies. Unlike anime which follows manga, this story takes liberty and has changes in the content so it isn't the same thing re-told in live-action format, but the base premise is the same.",
