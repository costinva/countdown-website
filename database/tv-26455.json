  "overview": "Hot Package is an entertainment variety show, created by Derrick Beckles. The show parodies network entertainment shows such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood. Instead of sourcing its news from real celebrities, TV shows, and films, all of Hot Package's \"entertainment\" news comes from found footage, including clips from forgotten B Films and bizarre TV shows.",
