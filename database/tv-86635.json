  "overview": "The plot of «Nerves of Steel» introduces us to Max, a young and talented manager. His strong, but surprisingly nasty character helps him reach the top of his career but scares away others. Max's grandfather believes that life has no meaning without friends and love, so he finds his own way to influence his grandson. Now Max has a choice: get engaged to the girl his grandfather has chosen for him, or lose his leadership position in the family business and be excluded from the will. The elderly man's chosen one is a plain and not very attractive nurse who works in a nursing home. How will the acquaintance of these very different people end?",
