  "overview": "With many of us at home now looking for meal inspiration, a brand new eight-part series on RTÉ One Cook-In, with award-winning chef Mark Moriarty and Bord Bia, aims to give us home chefs a survival guide of easy-to follow, uplifting recipes for nutritious meals made from the humble contents of our kitchen fridges, cupboards and freezers. Nothing could be more delicious and simple!As we try to maintain a balanced  diet while reducing supermarket visits as Covid-19 restrictions remain in place, Cook-In with Mark Moriarty will be armed with recipes that make the most out of the food we have at home:  fresh, freezer food and non-perishables, tinned pulses and packets and even left overs.",
