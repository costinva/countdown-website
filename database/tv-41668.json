  "overview": "What's old isn't just new again, come doomsday, it'll save your life! Whether threatened by hurricane, power outage or nuclear fallout, most of today's devices that we rely on won't work in a catastrophe - if the internet crashes and power fails modern technology could be rendered useless. Knowing this, survivalists and preppers are on the hunt for bygone technology that will work in any worst-case scenario.Masters of Disaster centers on Survival Research Inc., on the outskirts of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and a talented crew of craftsmen who source, restore, and sell vintage objects that may be useful in any calamity.",
