  "overview": "In the story, US President Joe Biden flies to Russia undercover to find out how his sanctions policy has affected the lives of Russians. Russian Russian patriot Joe loses his documents on the very first day, but he finds a new friend — a real Russian patriot who becomes his guide in Russian adventures and the knowledge of that mysterious Russian soul. Biden gets a job as an English teacher at a regular school and lives in Khrushchev. Meanwhile, CIA agents are taking a Russian pensioner Ivanich, who looks very similar to Biden, to the United States.",
