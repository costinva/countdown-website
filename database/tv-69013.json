Oper Boris Fadeev was not distinguished by a special zeal for work - he always sought to avoid unnecessary tasks and evade responsibility. Problems in the family, alcoholism and poor mental health complicate his already difficult life, in addition, he learns about a hereditary disease, due to which he may soon die. Not wanting to die ingloriously, Fadeev, to the surprise of those around him, is transformed and begins to take on the most difficult cases, not at all caring about his safety. Boris is sure that he will be able to leave beautifully. Here's just one catch: no matter how hard he tries, he stays alive over and over again.",
