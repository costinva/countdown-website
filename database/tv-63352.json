  "overview": "Eva, a reclusive seventeen-year-old, meets a group of teenagers who enjoy recreationally using Icelotropine, a medication stolen from a sleep-clinic, in an attempt to cope with the pain of their tedious lives. The drug's psychotropic effects allow them to freely navigate between their dreams and reality. Eva is introduced to the group by Sebastien, but as the story unfolds, their escapist dreams become infectious nightmares as the line between their sleep states and reality quickly starts to blur. Sebastien finds himself trapped inside a hellish maze-like nightmare to which only Eva seems to have the key.",
