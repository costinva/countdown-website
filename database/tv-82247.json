  "overview": "In this brand-new series, George Clarke meets people who are taking on challenging huge builds for powerful emotional reasons, from being drawn back to an area that they've always loved or a place with strong family memories, to taking on a house that's close to their heart - like historic ruins that need rescuing, or a wreck of a beach house. We follow them as they uproot their lives, stretch their finances and test their relationships, all in order to build wonderful homes of their dreams.",
