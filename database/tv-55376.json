  "overview": "The world's largest conservation project has been created in China. Discover the breathtaking wildlife hidden inside its stunning national parks. This stunning series opens with China's mountainous terrains, where foxes, antelopes, and snow leopards thrive in harsh conditions. It then moves to dense forests that host the extraordinary snub-nosed monkeys and iconic giant pandas. Finally, on the fringes of the city, people must make space for nature and find a way to live alongside some spectacular animals. With 20% of China designated as protected land, how are the Chinese people adapting to their country's conservation efforts? And could this landmark project inspire similar projects across the globe?",
