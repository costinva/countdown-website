  "overview": "Africa's Trees of Life tells three stories of the endurance and survival of Africa's most iconic natural history symbols – from predators to prey, extreme environments and legendary trees. A pride of lions, a territorial leopard and a cheetah mother play out their lives in the shadows of three impressive trees – the sausage tree in the Luangwa Valley in Zambia, the Acacia camel thorn in the Kalahari in South Africa, and the marula tree in the Manyeleti near the Kruger National Park. This is the incredible story of the hunters and the prey that depend on these remarkable trees – the trees of life.",
