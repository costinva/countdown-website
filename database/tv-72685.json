  "overview": "Bruno is not just any cop. He is Boom Boom Bruno, the district's cowboy. Everything here is under his control. His criminals, his hookers, his boss. He is thrilled with his new partner Mark - it's up to him to teach this insecure boy to be a real man with balls. When a drag queen is found dead on his turf, however, both Bruno and Mark must fight their own prejudices and meet resistance coming from all sides to solve the case.",
