  "overview": "From the high school stage to center stage, MTV follows the stories of some of the most talented teenagers in the nation as they balance the enormous pressures of pursuing their dreams while navigating their way through the normal trials and tribulations of high school. Created by Nick Lachey and Colton Gramm, the show features students from Cincinnati's famed, School for the Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA). These gifted students face difficult decisions in planning for their futures and because of their common bonds of artistic expression, form life long friendships along the way. In this intensely competitive world of performing arts, MTV viewers will meet dream seekers from all over -- a ballerina who dreams of dancing at the celebrated Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre, to a gifted hip-hop dancer who's new to the school and chasing the dream of dancing in music videos to a student who dreams of one day performing on Broadway. Each student is following their dream, and the cameras will be there to capture everything that comes along in their pursuit of their goals: The ups and downs, the adulations and the tears, and that moment when they risk it all.
