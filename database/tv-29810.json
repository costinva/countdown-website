  "overview": "Asuka is a high school student who sees the apparition of a dead \nstudent named Haruka, asking Asuka to find her body. Asuka and her \nfriends attempt to find the eight scattered pieces of Haruka's corpse in\n the school, and learn more about the Red Person that is hunting them as\n they do so. The Red Person hunts students who are alone at school to \nkill them, and until they exit the school gates, the Red Person will \nkeep appearing before them. When the Red Person kills a student, it \nscatters the student's body into eight pieces, and tasks another person \nto find the pieces in the school. If Asuka fails to find Haruka's body, \nthe day will keep repeating and she and her friends will keep dying \nuntil they do.",
