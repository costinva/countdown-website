  "overview": "An Binh is very self-conscious about his appearance because of burn scars from his childhood, so that he doesn't have the courage to pursue his dream of a music career and always hides behind a mask when singing. Minh Thang in contrast is a strong, open-minded guy who dares to say and do what he wants. Because of an incident, the two of them meet and so a love story begins that is both interesting, humorous, and equally touching about the journey of overcoming the limits in pursuing what they love.",
