  "overview": "This drama is a human legal story centered on lawyer Otokita Hajime and detective Iseya Kai, who are partners both in their private lives and in work. Together, they take on divorce cases to help those suffering from a partner's betrayal. Their opponents are anything but ordinary; from a sleazy, high-profile TV host who assaults his junior female announcers behind his likable public image, to a so-called \"fickle woman\" who betrays her same-sex lover to marry someone of the opposite sex.",
