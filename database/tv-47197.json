  "overview": "In Flour Power, we tap into the baking culture sweeping through offices across the country and turn it into full scale workplace warfare! In each show we visit a different business to watch four colleagues go head to head for the Flour Power trophy. From distillers to vets, salons to solicitors, these amateur bakers are determined to cook up a storm and win the office bragging rights.",
