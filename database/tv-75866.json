  "overview": "A biographical film based on the best-selling book of the same name by Vladimir Pozner. A story about how an era influences a person's fate. And how a person himself changes over time: remains true to his values, makes compromises, becomes disillusioned with ideals, but at the same time continues to search for answers to eternal questions.",
