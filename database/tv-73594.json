  "overview": "Kurose Reiji is a 17-year-old high school boy whose family members are full of problems. Due to this circumstance, Reiji has no particular dream and wants to get a job instead of going to college to make his mother's life easier. Just as Reiji was spending his days vaguely, he had a fateful encounter with an idol called Aoe Nagi, who proposed to Reiji that they commit suicide together. Will Reiji be able to find the light in his life after all the problems occurring one after another around him?",
