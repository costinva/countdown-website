  "overview": "What would your life be like if two sports commentators followed and commented on it? Semih and Selin's love, fight, excitement and jealousy are conveyed through the eyes of two sports commentators Fikri and Mesut. Conversations to the crown, fierce battles, efforts to turn the match back on, positions viewed in slow motion. Even though Semih and Selin never see the commentators, we visit their world every week and witness different competitions with the participation of famous guests.",
