  "overview": "The Sixth Commandment tells the story of how the meeting of an inspirational teacher, Peter Farquhar, and a charismatic student, Ben Field, set the stage for one of the most complex and confounding criminal cases in recent memory. It also focuses on how suspicions around Field's relationship with Ann Moore-Martin, Peter's deeply religious neighbour, unlocked a series of chilling revelations.The Sixth Commandment explores the way in which both Peter and Ann were manipulated by Field, capturing the extreme gaslighting, the gripping police investigation and the high-profile trial, while poignantly highlighting the devastating effect of isolation and loneliness, as Field closed in on them. It also celebrates both Peter and Ann's lives as cherished mentors, much loved relatives and adored friends.",
