  "overview": "Set in Szczecin, Poland, the series begins after the body of a young woman is discovered under the melting ice. It asks ‘Who was she? Why did she die? Who did she leave behind? Did people who are now mourning know who she really was? These questions and the search for answers will provide the main female character with a powerful, although initially unconscious incentive to confront her own circumstances: of a single mother playing the role of a perfect police officer, and above all, a woman in crisis.",
