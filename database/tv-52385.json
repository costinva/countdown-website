  "overview": "Will these ex-cons feel imprisoned in their own relationships, or are these couples ready for a life sentence together? The couples will face plenty of firsts in their new lives together - from new marriages to divorce, new homes to new children, all while living under the challenges of their parole. Possible restrictions abound: early curfews, random check-ins, drug tests, travel prohibitions, consorting with ex-cons combined with the temptations of alcohol and drugs, the stakes have never been higher. Will they stay together and stay out of prison?",
