  "overview": "In Fight to Survive, Akbar Gbajabiamila hosts a social experiment in primitive survivalism—with a competitive twist. Seventeen competitors, including former \"Survivor,\" \"Alone,\" \"Naked and Afraid,\" and \"American Ninja Warrior\" contestants, must survive 25 days on a remote tropical island combatting brutal conditions—and each other—to win $250,000. In one of the most intense survival-of-the-fittest competitions ever televised, the competitors battle one another for essential tools and resources in the fight to survive.",
