  "overview": "Hip Hop Treasures provides a behind the scenes look at the people and items that gave birth to the cultural phenomenon that is Hip Hop. With the help of LL COOL J, Ice T, field collectors Cipha Sounds and Yo-Yo along with Chief Museum Curator Paradise Gray and curator Pete Nice, some of these elusive items are brought back to the archive and will be put on display at The Universal Hip Hop Museum. The museum is poised to become \"The Official Record of Hip Hop\" and is currently in the process of building the world's largest Hip Hop memorabilia collection. The permanent home of the Universal Hip Hop Museum will open to visitors worldwide in 2024.",
