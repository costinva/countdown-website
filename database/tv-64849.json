  "overview": "Qin Xi is an art director who puts love first, but is independent and has a high IQ. One evening she accidentally saw that her boyfriend's childhood friend was going to kiss him. Four years of accumulated disappointment forced her to resign immediately and part without delay. At the same time, the phone was bursting with spam, in which the game \"Play an ex-boyfriend\" was being promoted. The enraged Qin Xi didn't hesitate to open a fantasy game to unlock a love strategy with a two-faced guy.",
