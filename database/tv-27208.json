  "overview": "Mining the waters off the Alabama coast in search of shrimp, or \"saltwater gold,\" as the shrimpers call them, is a treacherous job for the crews who work for the popular Dominick's Seafood, owned by Dominick Ficarino, in Bayou La Batre, Ala. This series follows the captains and crews of three of Dominick's boats, who work up to 40 days at a time -- sometimes working for 48 hours straight. In addition to the long hours, the crew members battle unforgiving weather conditions, equipment failures, competing boats and, at times, even one another.",
