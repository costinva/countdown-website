  "overview": "Sixteen-year-old Nathan is the illegitimate son of the world's most feared witch. He's spent his whole life being monitored for signs he may follow the same destructive path as his father. But as tensions escalate, the old boundaries between \"good\" and \"bad\" fray and Nathan will discover what sort of person he truly is. This is an angsty, roller-coaster ride of a young adult show about a troubled kid who has the indomitable will to survive and defy the odds.",
