  "overview": "Three mothers in their 30s, 40s, and 50s cross paths with Torako. One is a working mom who is worried sick about her child's future. Another became a second wife and entered the upper echelon of society whose net worth is in the top 3%, but feels she doesn't belong. The third is a despondent divorced mother working at her parents' restaurant. Although there is a huge difference in their standard of living, the three women long for the same thingâ€”for their child to get into their dream school.",
