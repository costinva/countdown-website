  "overview": "You can start from scratch at any age. Even when you're 60 years old and everything seems to be fine with you. Viktor Molodtsov, a lonely widower, an official of the \"old school\" of the Zauralsk city hall, who does not recognize modern technology, unexpectedly learns that he has an adult daughter in the capital… And she heads one of the departments of the Ministry of Digital and Advanced Development. Unlike her gentle and immoderate father, Ekaterina Kulik is very confident, tough and progressive — she constantly modernizes all existing work processes. Molodtsov's \"relations department\" finds an opportunity to get a job as an ordinary employee in the Ministry. He goes to Moscow to find out if this is really his daughter, and if so, to gain her trust.",
