  "overview": "They're here to prove that haunted houses aren't all that scaryâ€¦ or are they? Some shenanigans are underway, but so are friendships, dreams, and love.Home is the heir of a very wealthy old money family, and he's been living his best life up until the moment his grandfather passed away. He's now back in Thailand to inherit everything, only there's a big fat catch: all the properties his grandfather left him are infested with persistent evil spirits, and nobody would buy them. Peach is a talented chef whose life has turned upside down ever since a near-death accident that makes him see ghosts. He becomes a shut-in so much so that his younger sister Pangpang, a wannabe TikToker, begins to worry. One day, Peach is invited to a homecoming party at an allegedly haunted house which turns out to be legit. Pangpang films the whole haunting scene, posts it online, and it instantly becomes viral.Seeing that video for the first time, Home starts shaking with anger. He and Kan, the family's attorney, make it their mission to seek Peach out and demand responsibility by making him bust the ghosts in all the properties. Two men looking for home are now joining hands in this ghostbusting business, and it seems that the most messy party of four very different people is about to get started.Heartwarming friendships, haunting stories, and a whole lot of smiles are waiting for them somewhere along the way. Redefine the definition of \"home\" with them.",
