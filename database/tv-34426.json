  "overview": "While travelling to exotic locations and writing about enlightening experiences may sound like an adventurous occupation, the life of a travel writer is not always as glamorous as it seems. Word Travels is a new TV series that follows freelance journalist Robin Esrock and national travel columnist Julia Dimon as they battle deadlines, jetlag, culture shock – and each other – to file the best travel stories possible. Filmed in 24 countries across six continents, each half-hour episode of this 24-part series reveals the real story of professional travel journalism – the truth behind the byline. Join these two young writers as they travel the world while sleuthing stories, following leads and working to strict deadlines.",
