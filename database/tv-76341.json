  "overview": "When a new client comes into James Busby's hair salon, all he knows is their name, never their story. As each powerful episode unfolds, we join him on a gripping journey of discovery as he cuts to the crime.Featuring hairdresser and host James Busby, well-known for his transformative online hairdressing content, contributors arrive at his salon and sit in the chair, just like in any hairdressers. While they have their hair washed, cut, dried, and styled, James nurtures them through a powerful, revealing and personally rewarding chat that allows them to share their story and the impact on them, their friends, their family and the wider public too. Each contributor opens up to James in an honest chat that's unfiltered, to the point, real and emotional.Â ",
