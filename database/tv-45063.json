  "overview": "On a sparsely traveled road deep in the Colorado mountains, college student Andy Braddock drives to a New Year's Eve party to try to rekindle a relationship with his ex-girlfriend. Distracted by his phone, Andy collides with a snowbank and hurtles into a ravine. Wounded and alone, Andy turns to his quickly dying cell for rescue, but help is far from a phone call away...Two narratives play out simultaneously: watch horizontally for a cinematic view; twist vertically to experience Andy's phone as your own, as he fights to stay alive.",
