  "overview": "Skam España is a portrait of the generation of boys and girls born since 2000: their thoughts, problems, feelings, and wants; and above all, what they are ashamed of and what they don't say. The series accompanies a group of 16-year-olds on the journey of their life following their day-to-day in real time. Dependence on social media, how they face sex, love, and ruptures, the search for identity and the need to fit in. Skam España is an spanish adaptation of an Norwegian online television show called Skam.",
