  "overview": "E4 enters the sizzling world of summer jobs in the sun with Club Rep Wars. The show will follows two teams of wannabe club reps competing to win the chance to work a season on the party island of Zante.Each week a new arrival will spend time with two separate teams of reps, getting a crash course in the job and helping to put on fun packed events and activities to help holiday makers have the time of their lives.Once each new recruit has worked, lived, and partied with both teams they'll have to decide which of the two has what it takes to bring the most fun, throw the best beach parties and help them bag the overall prize – a job as a club rep for the rest of the summer.Sizzling temperatures, pool parties, hot bodies and even harder graft, the series will follow all of the action on the strip – from new friendships, fleeting romances, fierce fall outs and competition sabotage!",
