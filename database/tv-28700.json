  "overview": "A restaurant called \"Yōshoku no Nekoya\" (Western Cuisine Cat Restaurant), which is located on the first basement floor of a building at a corner of a shopping district near an office area. While it normally feeds salarymen, there is a secret in Nekoya. Every Saturday when the shop takes a day off, Nekoya is teeming full of \"special customers\". For the office workers, it is a familiar place with familiar dishes, but for these Saturday customers — \"people from that world\" — it is nothing but cuisine never seen or heard before.",
