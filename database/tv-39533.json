  "overview": "Rick Bryant, master auctioneer, puts on one of the biggest shows in the Missouri Ozarks. Buyers and sellers come to Bryant Auction from hundreds of miles away every week for a bidding showdown. It's anybody's guess who will win and who will lose, but everyone knows they're in for an eyeful of rare collectibles, crazy one-of-a-kind items, and a colorful cast of characters who'd do anything to energize a crowd. Every day brings new items and new drama at Bryant Auction. In the new 10-part series Sold!, History goes behind the scenes with Rick and his crew as they track down objects with profit potential, haggle with sellers, and create a stir on the auction floor to get the bidding wars going.",
