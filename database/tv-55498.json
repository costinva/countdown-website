  "overview": "The three men sometimes collude, sometimes collide. And for better or worse, Towako ends up caught in the middle. Like when she starts preparing to spend time with a new man. Who tags along? Her three ex-husbands, of course. My Dear Exes is a heartwarming comedy about four kind-hearted souls that invites viewers to think about the meaning of family and the paths we choose in life to make us happy.",
