  "overview": "Tony Pergatelli is a low level bureaucrat in Purgatory--a claims adjustor for Death. Day in and day out, Tony reviews the files of the newly dead and decides singlehandedly whether they're approved or denied to get into Heaven. He's unqualified, unsure of himself and unbelievably burdened by the weight of his choices. It's just one thing after another!",
