  "overview": "Dex is a 9-year-old artist, explorer, and ‘paleontologist in training'. Like Dan, Trek, and Dana before him, Dex uses his Dino Field Guide to magically see and study dinosaurs in the real world. But Dex envisions them a little differently. Thanks to his artistic eye, Dex wants to reconsider how dinosaurs looked and lived and he's not afraid to get right into the action to do it. Fortunately, he's got his geology-loving neighbor Kayla along for this prehistoric ride. Join Dex and Kayla as they re-examine and question everything we thought we knew about dinosaurs. ",
