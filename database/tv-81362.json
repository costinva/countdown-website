  "overview": "Kitami Makoto once led a life full of betrayal and had lost his ability to trust others. Similarly, Ashihara Ritu is bound by past wounds, struggling to live within his own despair. By chance, the two meet and begin a peculiar shared life together. Ritu's innocent and unpretentious approach to life starts to melt Makoto's closed-off heart, allowing him to feel trust and affection once more. However, the relationship between Makoto and Ritu is far from simple, as their pasts loom over them like insurmountable walls. Facing their weaknesses and despair, the two begin to grow together. How will Makoto reclaim his lost sense of self, and will his relationship with Ritu illuminate a new path for them both? Their future now begins to take shape, bit by bit.",
