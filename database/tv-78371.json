  "overview": "The show \"Stars in the Jungle\" will feature 19 popular artists. From the first day, 10 people will live in the jungle camp, and the rest will appear after someone from the first team leaves. The main task of the participants is to earn coins on difficult challenges, which can be spent on food or taken away as a cash prize – it all depends on the choice of stars. The maximum winnings can be more than 30 million rubles!Every week, one of the participants leaves the project in the traditional voting for this format, which means that the audience will again witness intrigues, conflicts, coalitions, conspiracies and everything that makes a cool reality show a real reality!",
