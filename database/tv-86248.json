  "overview": "«Kto kuda» is not just a travel show, it is a real travel game, where the hosts become players. Here they do not rely on fate and do not toss coins: Leo and Angelica choose where they will go themselves and compete for a place in a luxury hotel. For one day, the hosts go to different parts of Russia to get to know the city and its color better with the help of specially prepared tasks for each other. Whoever passes the tests faster gets the right to spend the night in the most luxurious hotel. The loser will spend the night in an ordinary cheap hostel.",
