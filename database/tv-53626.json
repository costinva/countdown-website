  "overview": "Based on a true story, The Good Mothers follows the story of Denise, daughter of Lea Garofalo, Maria Concetta Cacciola and Giuseppina Pesce, three women who dared to defy the ‘Ndrangheta mafia. To help them, prosecutor Anna Colace, having just arrived in Calabria, has an intuition: to be able to defeat the ‘Ndrangheta clans, you need to focus on the women. It is a strategy that brings with it great risk: The ‘Ndrangheta is famous and feared for its iron fist and insidious power. The Good Mothers follows Denise, Giuseppina and Maria Concetta in their attempt to free themselves from the criminal power and collaborate with the authorities.",
