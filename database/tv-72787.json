  "overview": "In our chaotic world, wouldn't it be nice to slow down, take a deep breath, and chill? Get comfy with Melbourne-based artist and social media icon Phil Ferguson (@chiliphilly) as they settle down to crochet a cute plush hat, based on treats like baked goods or hot lattes, all while threading through stories of their own. Unwind and unspool with this Bob Ross for a new generation -- It's time to Chill with Phil!",
