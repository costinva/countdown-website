  "overview": "A new show with Olga Buzova and Dmitry Dibrov. Two teams are playing a non-standard game. Men are playing against girls. They will have to guess what the people of our country consider normal and what is not. The participants will have to answer five highly social questions. The one who gave the most correct answers wins. The correct answer will be the one that the majority of Russian residents gave as a result of a social survey. In addition to the players, ordinary people with personal stories and star experts will come to the studio, who together with the players will try to figure out if the way they live, what they think about and what decisions they make are normal.Each question is something that the inhabitants of our country often thought about themselves, but were afraid to answer honestly to themselves. \"This is Normal\" is the only show in the country where the participants frankly and uncut admit what is normal for them and what is not.",
