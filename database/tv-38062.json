  "overview": "What does it take to maintain a pristine reputation and meet the impossible demands of an A-list clientele at one of the nation's top five-star resorts? Bravo goes inside the luxurious world of the Parker Palm Springs hotel in the new docu-series Welcome to the Parker. Each episode follows the inherent drama, exhausting lives and complicated relationships between the top-notch hotel staff and their exacting and sometimes very particular guests. There's never a dull moment at this retreat for the rich and famous-whether Parker designer Jonathan Adler demands a full-time \"pillow fluffer\" to maintain the hotel's lush d√©cor, or an over-the-top food critic puts everyone in a tizzy, or a group of Hollywood insiders trash the hotel's most expensive suite with a tricycle and too much beer.",
