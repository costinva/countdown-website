  "overview": "Gods of Tennis celebrates the golden era of tennis in the 1970s and 80s; a time when cultural changes in the modern world descended on the most famous tennis tournament in the world - Wimbledon. Telling the inside story of the legendary players who transformed the game, the series features a cast of sporting geniuses; icons like Navratilova, Borg, and Evert, giving first-hand accounts of the seminal moments in their careers, at a time when a global audience was captivated by an annual Wimbledon soap opera. Alongside personal insight, this distinctive period is brought back to life. The series features rich cultural, political and sporting archive as global events like the cold war, the sexual revolution, race relations and the fight for LGBT rights found expression in the Wimbledon Championships, the game's most traditional sporting arena.",
