  "overview": "A dreamy culinary school graduate, Sashka, comes to conquer Moscow. He dreams of having his own restaurant, but for now he has to work in a third-rate eatery and put up with a rude manager. The guy is even less lucky with his neighbors: the only available option is a workshop in an abandoned factory building, which has been chosen by four strange types: Discord, Death, Plague and Famine. These four horsemen of the apocalypse signed a contract to destroy the Earth, according to which they are supposed to have their most cherished wish fulfilled. But another weighty condition is that they must arrange this apocalypse themselves, and if humanity is destroyed by aliens, artificial intelligence, an ecological disaster or even mutant mushrooms, the horsemen will not receive their reward. So for several centuries now they have had to save humanity from the deadly dangers raining down on it, which the inhabitants of the planet do not even suspect. Sashka amazes the four with his culinary skills, teaches them to watch TV and quickly becomes one of the rescue squad.",
