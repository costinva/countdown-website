  "overview": "Hollywood Love Story is a series in which Paris Hilton, an Insta-famous celebrity before there was a name for it, introduces tales of wannabe singers, model-actresses, rappers, photographers, designers and DJs trying to make it in modern day Los Angeles. They've all got big dreams and backstories and exemplify the current so-called \"selfie culture.\" Each episode explores the blurred lines between the fantasy and reality of living in Hollywood craving fame and sharing it all on social media, where success and self-worth are measured in likes, follows and reposts.",
