  "overview": "The gripping story of Tarik, who wants to take revenge on his brother's murderer, and Elif, who cannot face the fact that the only thing to hold on to in life is the murderer, meets the audience with Fedakar. Elif, who lost her mother at a young age, is a devoted sister who supports her siblings Sefer and Narin. While Elif leads a life full of difficulties, she loses her younger sister Narin and only Sefer remains with her. While the two brothers are holding on to each other, Elif is suddenly devastated by the allegation that her sister Sefer is the murderer. The happy and peaceful life of Tarik, the sole heir of Karaca Holding, one of the few companies in Turkey, suddenly changes with the murder of his older sister, whom he loves dearly. Tarik kidnaps Elif to catch Sefer, who went missing because she thought that Sefer killed her older sister Yesim. While Tariq swears to avenge his sister, Elif and Tarik set sail for an impossible love. Will time help break down the insurmountable obstacles? Will the power of love be enough to forget the sibling pain? Will Elif's mercy heal Tarik's wounds?",
