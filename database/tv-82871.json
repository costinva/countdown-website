  "overview": "If there were a guide for love, would Bunny not have been a pushover? Although she is crazy over good looks, Bunny believes sincerity is more important when dating. The result? Her first love with terrible looks and an awful personality turns out to be the worst, and she becomes known as a school-wide pushover. With the determination to never fail again, Bunny declares she will no longer act like a doormat and only date alpha males when four outstanding oppas appear before her. Bunny's heart gets no rest amid the endless parade of high-quality flirting, aimed to win her over and become her number one oppa. Is this a guide to stop being a pushover? Or is it a proper dating course for falling in love? Will Bunny the pushover transform into a dating genius?",
