  "overview": "AJ Odudu presents this contest in which eight up-and-coming interior designers battle it out to make over - and ultimately win - an apartment of their own, worth Â£250,000. Judge and award-winning architect Dara Huang pushes their creativity to the limit as they work on a different room in their apartment each week. At the end, if their keycard lights up green, they live to compete another week. If it's red, their time in the competition is up.",
