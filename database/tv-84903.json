  "overview": "The original JOJ TV series presents medical stories in a completely different way than before.The fictional stories about medical errors or failures are in many cases inspired by real events.Tomáš Maštalír as MUDr. Daniel Ludsky is an expert on diagnoses and medical malpractice. As a forensic expert, he often cooperates with the police. Dr. Ludsky is not the hero we are used to - he is intelligent, uncompromising, arrogant and impatient. He hates sloppiness and incompetence, so he doesn't have many friends among his colleagues. But he believes in the truth and in the patient's right to be treated decently. He is not very happy in private either. He is divorced and, alongside his work, struggles to find time for his teenage daughter.",
