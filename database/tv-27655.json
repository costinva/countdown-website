  "overview": "They say cats have nine lives, and Felix seems to have been no exception. Nearly thirty-five years after his first show, the wonderful, wonderful cat was meowing his way into the 1990's. CBS was so convinced that Felix should be welcomed aboard the Saturday morning lineup that they rushed out 55 five-second bumpers for the 1994 season.",
