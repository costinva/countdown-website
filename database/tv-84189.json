  "overview": "Greatest Escapes of WWII looks at some of the most incredible escapes of World War II. From both sides of the war and all around the world, captured soldiers, sailors and airmen dared the impossible to win their freedom. They dug tunnels, stole planes, forced their way through deadly jungles, and marched huge distances pursued by death squadsâ€¦ a testament to the unrelenting human spirit that refuses to concede. These are their stories.",
