  "overview": "To get close to the indulgent warlord Yan Xuan, Jiang Yao, a member of the anti-warlord organization, Feiwu, pretends to be an item at an underground auction, hoping to be bidded by him. As the target is about to fall into the trap, Jiang Yao's plan is unexpectedly disrupted by a mysterious man who bids a high price for her. Only when the mysterious man walks into the spotlight does she realize that he is actually her old flame from five years agoâ€”Chi Yanzhou! At present, Chi Yanzhou's loving gaze has turned glares of hatred. It turns out that he was the first target of the Feiwu Organization, and Jiang Yao, who has returned from studying abroad, is chosen as an undercover agent. With time and interactions, the two gradually fall in love. For the big picture, Jiang Yao ultimately chooses to complete the mission, but it indirectly leads to the death of Chi's father and the disappearance of Chi Yanzhou. When they reunite after a long time, Chi Yanzhou has become extremely powerful. With a heart for revenge, he tries every means to torture and humiliate Jiang Yao, both causing chaos in Jiang Yao's life and plunging into deeper agony.",
