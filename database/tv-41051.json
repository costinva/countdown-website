  "overview": "Hitler's Bodyguard is an explosive 13-part series from the makers of the acclaimed Churchill's Bodyguard. Now for the first time thanks to previously never before seen SS records and images, the series provides a unique insight into the men that guard Hitler and explores one of the most enduring and unanswered questions surviving from World War II. Why, in 25 years, did no-one manage to kill Adolf Hitler?",
