  "overview": "You can't keep a good dog down. Or a bad cat either. Meet the wildest gang of four-legged friends ever. A loyal dog. An evil kitten. A bear waiting for aliens to take him back to outer space. Plus -- an obsessed bird, a pair of criminal cats, and many, many more. You've never seen animals like these before! The Twisted Whiskers are always getting into seriously strange situations â€¦ and that's when the fun starts.",
