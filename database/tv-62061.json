  "overview": "Ann Ishiwatari had a carefree and comfortable existence until the sudden disappearance of her husband turned her life upside down. Now she must make her way as a single mother with a son who has just entered an elite high school. In this new social environment, she meets Yuko Hayashi, a successful businesswoman and the glamorous Ms. Kanbara who is plagued by her husband's extramarital affairs. Though outwardly happy, their lives hide troubling secrets that can't be known. But fighting through pain, these three never-say-die moms parlay their struggles into unexpected new life directions, and perhaps even re-experience the magic of romance in this life-size love story.",
