  "overview": "Dekirukana was an educative children's television show produced by NHK between 1967 and 1990.The show consisted of 15 minute episodes and was based around craft work, mainly using paper. It showed kids how to use scissors and adhesive tape. The protagonists were Noppo, played by Ei Takami, and the anthropomorphic gopher Gonta.Dekirukana was broadcast during the 1980s and 1990s with great success in many state-run networks in Latin America, to whom NHK donated the programme, among other didactic shows. In these countries the name of the show was translated as Â¿Puedo hacerlo yo?, but it is informally known as Nopo y Gonta, after the main characters.This program was also broadcast by Rupavahini in Sri Lanka and in mid 1990s in TVP1.",
