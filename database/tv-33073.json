  "overview": "A documentary series set inside the New York Daily News, Tabloid Wars is like visiting a tornado. Everyday is a deadline -- 365 days a year! Each episode of Tabloid Wars follows 4 - 5 characters, the journalists of the New York Daily News, as they track and pursue New York City's most exciting stories. Against the backdrop of a vicious war with the New York Post and the unrelenting deadlines that are a part of their world, we'll get to know each character as they battle for stories in areas of crime, disaster and celebrities.",
