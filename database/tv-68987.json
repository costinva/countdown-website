  "overview": "TV journalist Anders Agger and TV chef Anne Hjernøe go on a road trip to find home for the handheld summer vacation in Denmark. They have borrowed an old wagon rye bread with a top speed of 90 and are rolling around the country from Skagen to Sydfyn. With coffee breaks, forgotten dirt roads and small, seductive food experiences.",
