  "overview": "Yuki Rin's parents passed away and she has been living with her older brother Koichiro. Koichiro was an IT engineer who worked for the government until he was recruited by a vicious cyber crime group one year ago. That was when Rin's ordinary, happy life crumbled. She miraculously survived despite taking her brother's bullet. Then she was brought into FACE, a cyber crime special investigation unit which the Cabinet created in secret, on the strength of her profiling ability by Minegishi Shugoro. Believing in Minegishi, Rin joins the unit's members to combat cyber crime which can destabilize the nation.",
