  "overview": "You can't help but notice that cute guy at the gym, in the bar or around the neighborhood. You smile at each other. And all you're thinking is one question... Is he gay, straight or taken? Well, now you can find out how your intuition measures up by watching this new kind of dating game. It's a dating game with a twist like no other. One woman meets three men for a series of dates and then must decide who is gay, who is straight and who is taken. She has to select the one straight, single man in the trio in order to win a luxurious dream getaway for her and this available bachelor. If she makes the wrong call, the man she incorrectly chooses gets her prize instead!",
