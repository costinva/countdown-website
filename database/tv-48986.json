  "overview": "Like fish bait cast into a pool of sharks, idealistic Dorfmann arrives in Brussels with visions of a united Europe to serve an ambitious British Director of the European Economic Community, Michael Spearpoint. Planning to get rich exploiting the newly-liberated nations of Eastern Europe, wily bureaucrats and entrepreneurs compete to misuse the na√Øve Dorfmann, dubbed \"Prince Stupid,\" for their own ends. Easily deceived (especially by beautiful women!), Dorfmann instead stumbles along, crisscrossing foes, drawing fire and sparking mayhem in a comically woven web of intrigue and misadventure! Also stars Alexei Sayle and Almanta Suska.",
