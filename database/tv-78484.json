  "overview": "Crime Patrol Dial 100 attempts to bring stories of crime happening all around the country. Crimes that tell us that we need to be careful, we need to be watchful. Crimes that tell us lives could have been saved. Every crime we hear of, either warns us to be careful or scares us, it could happen to us. Every crime ignites a feeling, It should not have happened. Would knowing the Why? behind a crime, help in stopping a crime from happening?",
