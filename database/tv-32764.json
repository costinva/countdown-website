  "overview": "The creators of 'Spitting Image' present a comic strip (as in a collection of short and rude funny papers) on television. Presented by four rubber animals living in the London Sewer, namely Doc Croc (who had the ability to use his tail as an extra appendage) and his three ratty underlings: Vaudeville Vince Vermin, Jemimah Wellington-Green and Luchetti Bruchetti (birth name: Lou Brush). Every week they would unleash a cavalcade of puns (mostly revolving in and around the toilet) during their framework sequence, but the real highlight of the show were crudely animated cartoons and one slightly more impressive stop motion serial from 'Incredibly Cheap Productions' in association with 'We Could Use This Set For Something Else DLC' Some of the recurring 'comics' included the 'Odd Bot Family', 'Kenny McTickle and his magic Kilt', 'Tommy's Time Trousers' and of course 'Wooly the Wonder Sheep'.",
