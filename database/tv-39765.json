  "overview": "Britain's Youngest Football Boss follows top flight football club West Ham United women's team and their 19-year-old Managing Director Jack Sullivan in his first full-time job since leaving school at 16. As women's football explodes, the team makes its debut in the professional Women's Super League, and Jack's dad David Sullivan - one of the richest men in Britain and the Chairman of West Ham United - has tasked him with transforming the club's fortunes. With exclusive behind the scenes access, this is a revealing and intimate look at what it takes to be a professional female footballer in today's game, and whether a loveable but inexperienced teenager can change the face of women's football.",
