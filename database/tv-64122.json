And although he has tried countless times to change dentist in search of someone who does not fill him with dread, nothing frightens him more than the idea of having to have his teeth checked. But all that changes on the day that he visits the Gao Leng Dental Hospital – and meets the hospital's chief dentist Jin Xun'an.Jin Xun'an is not like all the dentists that Bai Lang has met before. He is gentle, caring, and kind. And Bai Lang begins to feel that Jin Xun'an sees him as more than a patient – and has romantic feelings toward him. But can love really spark between a dentist and his patient? Meanwhile, Zhou Cheng Hao a senior bartender at Bai Lang's bar and the owner's close friend is developing a close relationship with He Qing Tian – a rebellious young man 12 years his junior.
