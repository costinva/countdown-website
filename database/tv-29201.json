  "overview": "The Pacific Ocean covers one third of the Earth's surface. It is larger than all Earth's land combined, holds half of our world's water, and hides the deepest place on our planet. It is a place where huge and iconic, rare and dazzling creatures live â€“ and where creatures yet to be discovered lurk. The Pacific sees the most violent storms, creates the most powerful waves, and is powered by the strongest currents. It boasts the largest coral reefs and the richest kelp forests. Its submarine landscape plummets from sea grass prairies to the ultimate abyss, and its tropical seamounts starkly contrast with its massive ice floes. Over five cinematic episodes, Big Pacific breaks the boundaries between land and sea, moving throughout the Pacific Ocean to present a broad range of locations, species, natural phenomena and behaviors. Four of the episodes focus on an iconic characteristic of the Pacific: Passionate, Voracious, Violent, and Mysterious, to weave stories from across the Pacific that illustrate the multi-faceted character of this ocean.",
