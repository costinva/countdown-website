The queens face each other in a series of creative and acting challenges, including fashion runways, live performances, and music video recordings; all of this as they try to impress the judge's panel and avoid elimination. The queens will use their talent and personality to make it to the grand finale and compete in a lip-sync battle to snatch the crown.",
