  "overview": "Life happens fast. And in an instant, disaster could strike. A poisonous snakebite, a rushing tsunami, a skydiving mishap or a brake failure. When the choices you make mean the difference between life and death, what would you do? Each episode features the stories of real people caught in desperate situations, and offer viewers the choices these individuals faced in their struggle to survive. Through caught-on-tape moments and CGI, Do or Die is virtually at the scene of a life-or-death situation. But before finding out how the hero survives, viewers can put their own instincts to the test by evaluating three survival options for each scenario - two of which could be deadly. We give you the facts that will improve your odds of survival the next time you're in a Do or Die moment. With only a few seconds to react, would you make it out alive?",
