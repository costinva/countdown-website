In the most remote reaches of the smallest and most peaceful country on the island, the Kingdom of Bayle, is the small village where a girl named Nikola lives a humble life. One day, while she's out gathering firewood as she does every day, a massive dragon—a creature that's supposed to only live deep in the mountains—appears in front of her. Just as it's about to attack the village, a man named Haga rushes to the scene. Haga is a member of the King's Seekers, a top secret investigation team. Nikola has never once felt bored with her peaceful life, even when every single day is practically the same, but after meeting Haga, she's so intrigued by Haga and his travels that she decides to step out into the world herself... and then the learns the true nature of her world.",
