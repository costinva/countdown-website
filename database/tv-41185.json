  "overview": "The Trouble with Maggie Cole is set in a picturesque small coastal town with a close-knit community. It follows the stories and fall out for Maggie Connors who doesn't pay attention to the cautionary adage that â€˜those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones'.Maggie is a central character in town who makes it her business to know a bit about everyone's lives. When a radio journalist interviews her for a small reportage piece about local life she gives him far more detail (and embellishment) about the locals and their personal lives than he was counting on. In the days and weeks following the show's broadcast, Maggie sees the butterfly effect of how her very public gossip-fest affects various figures around the town and disrupts their lives.",
