  "overview": "The Space Race is back on! Larry McGlynn, Torie Lazaros and Cole Sommers\n are America's top space dealers – they hunt down and flip space kit and\n space hardware. Whether it's the pilot's seat from Gemini 12, an \nuneaten astronaut meal pack or the kit bag Buzz Aldrin took to the moon,\n if something's been to space it's worth BIG money. Every item they come\n across has a story – each one is a fascinating episode in the history \nof space exploration. And sometimes, there's a puzzle too: bits of space\n kit aren't always easy to identify. What did they do? These guys aren't\n just dealers, they're space detectives. Sometimes, to realise an item's\n true value, they have to find out where it was used, and how. So they \nhave to speak to people in the know – real space engineers and \ndesigners, and occasionally, the heroes who played a part in actual \nspace missions.",
