  "overview": "Escape to Monkey Island, deep in the tropical forests of Sri Lanka, where troops of toque macaques, tufted grey langurs, and purple-faced leaf monkeys have made their home among the crumbling ruins of ancient temples. In this verdant jungle, abundant fruit provides ample feasts for these foragers, but even in primate paradise, trouble awaits. Follow these charismatic monkeys as they deal with unpredictable weather and struggle to raise their young in an environment where hidden forest dangers lurk around every corner.",
