  "overview": "Kinfolk is a new musical show in which close relatives of very famous stars of our pop show sing. 100 players from all over the country will gather in a large studio and try not only to become famous by telling the audience about themselves, but also to earn money, because in the common bank there is one and a half million rubles. You just need to guess whose brother, godfather or matchmaker is performing so famously on stage in front of them.",
