  "overview": "The spark in Lene's marriage is long gone and when she suddenly loses her job at a prestigious advertisement agency, she feels lost and humiliated, wondering what to do next. One drunken night, she posts a scantily clad picture of herself wearing a traditional folk costume - mostly as a joke - on the website InsideFans. Lene soon realizes there is a niche audience out there who are thirsty for more and willing to pay for it.",
