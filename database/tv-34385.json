  "overview": "There are 12 people on the podium in front of the player. The player is asked to match each of them with the corresponding feature on the board (their profession, hobbies or personal achievement). First, the player must decide which feature on the board he will guess, and then chooses the person to whom, in the player's opinion, this feature corresponds. In case of a correct guess, the player remains in the game, and with each correct answer the amount increases, approaching the main prize, which can be won by guessing the features of all 12 strangers. After another correctly guessed stranger, the participant has the right to stop the game and take the money he earned.",
