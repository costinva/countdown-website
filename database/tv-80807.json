  "overview": "The side effect is Anouk, Marco, Fanny, Alex, Safa, Emma, Ahmed and many others who are going through high school with their heads filled with plans, doubts and intense emotions! It is also the effect of friendships that transform, unexpected rivalries, loves that are born, adults who take up too much space and trials that weaken. In the corridors of the school as in the courtyards, people stick together and confront each other, have fun and intimidate each other ... In short, it's everyday life, with its ups and downs, turned in a way rhythmic - in the manner of docurality - to capture hyper spontaneous slices of life.",
