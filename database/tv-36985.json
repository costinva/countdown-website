  "overview": "Investigative journalist Bruno Palmieri has an infallible memory for details. He has been living carefully, with a bullet lodged near his heart for the last 30 years, but now nearing retirement he decides to throw caution to the winds and live life with gusto, reconnecting with the love of his life and trying to resolve a few old cases. Meanwhile, his illegitimate daughter Maddalena arrives at the editorial office, the result of a relationship with his old flame Paola, who left him after he was wounded so as not to disrupt her life further after discovering she was pregnant.",
