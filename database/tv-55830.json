On their wedding night, Sigrid and Leif survive a wrath of terror from Thor, which sets them - and a crew of crusaders - on a merciless mission for vengeance, against all odds. This heroic story of love, loss, and revenge, is a journey to hell and beyond... across fantastical lands, battlefields fierce and bloody, and wars waged against gods and demons.",
