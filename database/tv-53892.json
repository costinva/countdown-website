  "overview": "Politie Dienst Infra is a reality series in which we follow the specialists of the Dutch police service Infra. Not only do we follow them during their day-to-day activities, but we also get to know their previous experiences and what it does to them mentally. Where others take a step back, they take a step forward. For the first time it becomes clear who they are, how they are educated and trained and what they can and are capable of doing.",
