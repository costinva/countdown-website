  "overview": "Small town mysteries are always seductive. They are inherently emotional and intimate, and when the whole town is affected, the stakes couldn't be higher. In this ID GO original series, we recount small-town murder investigations that consumed the locals for weeks, months or even years. Featuring compelling local news footage, we hear these gripping stories straight from the mouth of broadcast journalists who reported them as they broke. This digital companion to Hometown Homicide shows that sometimes murder strikes twice in the unlikeliest of places.",
