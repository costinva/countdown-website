  "overview": "Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders is a gripping three-part docuseries that revisits a chilling crime that shattered the nation's trust in the safety of everyday brands. Chicago, 1982: at least seven people die after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules, sparking nationwide panic and one of the largest criminal investigations in U.S. history. Is there one mastermind behind these horrific deaths, or is that simply a convenient scapegoat in a darker conspiracy and potential cover-up? The series reopens the case that turned the world's best-selling drug into a terrifying symbolâ€”and changed forever how we view the products in our own medicine cabinets.",
