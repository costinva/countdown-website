  "overview": "The story follows Shen Xifan, a dedicated workaholic and hotel housekeeping manager, who suffers from insomnia and migraines due to her high-intensity job. Seeking relief, she turns to traditional Chinese medicine and meets the gentle and refined doctor, He Suye. However, her busy schedule often causes her to forget to pick up her prescriptions, much to He Suye's frustration. What starts as a mere doctor-patient relationship takes an unexpected turn when they realize they live in the same neighborhood. Through a series of chance encounters, their feelings gradually blossom. Having experienced a painful first love, Shen Xifan is cautious, while He Suye, abandoned by his first love, has since closed off his heart. As Shen Xifan slowly approaches him, their awkward yet endearing interactions lead He Suye to rediscover the meaning of love, eventually making him the one to pursue her instead. Meanwhile, He Suye's dedication to traditional Chinese medicine inspires Shen Xifan to find her true aspirations.",
