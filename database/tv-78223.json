  "overview": "Sasha Reid and the Midnight Order follows Reid and her secret society who share a common obsession - the dark psychology of those who commit harm and the desire to protect those that law enforcement has ignored. They band together to work outside the system to protect the vulnerable, solve cold cases, and dive into the dark minds of killers using forensic expertise and world-class data skills. Their motto is to have compassion first, but let the evidence lead.",
