  "overview": "Four princesses have come from the netherworld and taken up residence in a giant tree-house in Hikarigaoka, Japan. Unfortunately for the princesses, learning to live in this new place is more difficult than expected. It certainly doesn't help that all four of them are idiots. This is the story of their failures and misunderstandings as they struggle to adapt and find acceptance in their new life.",
