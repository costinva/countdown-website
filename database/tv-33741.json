  "overview": "Based on the hit Scandinavian format, this outlandish yet emotional social experiment aims to discover how people's lives and values change once everything they own is stripped away. This new series exposes people's relationships with their personal belongings as they forego everything they own – clothing, furniture, money and all coveted possessions – for 21 days. Each day, they may retrieve one item that they cannot live without, and priorities will inevitably emerge. Expected to go about their daily lives by showing up to work, maintaining their families and keeping up with social circles – without their everyday necessities – each person jumps into survival mode in order to determine what is most essential to them. With no shortage of outrageous and uncomfortable moments along the way, this transformative journey has a life-changing impact as they each uncover what truly matters to them most.",
