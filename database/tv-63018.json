  "overview": "World War II was marked by epic battles that decided the fate of nations and changed the course of history. From Germany's Blitzkrieg attacks on France, which launched the European campaign, to the Allied invasion of Berlin, which signaled its violent end, we bring these seminal conflicts to life through never-before-seen colorized combat footage. WWII Battles in Color puts you in the center of the action through rarely-scene films from the frontline, plus personal memoirs and oral histories from both sides of the battle lines.",
