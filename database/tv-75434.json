Focusing on the race to return the interiors of these buildings to their former glory, we reveal fascinating and previously unseen work done by historical interiors experts as they source, beg, borrow and steal furniture, artwork and precious artefacts for their sites in time to open these stunning buildings to the public for the tourist season.",
