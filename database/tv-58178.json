  "overview": "In Mil Colmillos an elite commando must escort several snipers to within viable shooting distance, finish off the target and return to the extraction point. But everything falls apart when a strange entity starts taking out soldiers one by one, setting off a desperate race to find a way out of the dense and unpredictable jungle. Outnumbered and hunted, they are about to face a dark and sinister secret that is over 500 years in the making. The jungle will become hell for this group of soldiers, who will race for survival through a dead-end labyrinth that is as evil as it is unfathomable.",
