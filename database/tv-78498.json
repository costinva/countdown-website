  "overview": "Security Zhang Hao bragged to his villagers in Erlong Lake village. To cover it up, he had to transform into a commercial genius, claiming to have brought \"enormous investments\" back with him and returned with a \"professional team\". His return coincided with his long-time friend, Li Minghan, a graduate student who had devoted herself wholeheartedly to her hometown's development and rural revitalization efforts. In this unique context of northeastern rural China, where the two people vastly differ in terms of their origins, working styles, and educational backgrounds, they offer a series of punch lines that harmoniously blend differences. As the hope of the entire village, Zhang Hao, unwittingly becomes the common target of 'tiger parenting' and at the same time, eager for success but lacking both business acumen and experience, becomes a prey to the scams.",
