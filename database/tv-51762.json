  "overview": "The story revolves around a 9-year old boy by the name of Hanada Ichiro living in a small-town in rural Japan. He is a menace in the area in which he lives in and one day, he gets knocked down by a car when he`s up to his dirty pranks. After that accident, apart from getting a nasty scar and going bald, he is able to see ghosts and monsters.

He is accompanied in his adventures by his friends Souta and Kei-chan, and his dog Jiro. The story is poignant and very touching.",
