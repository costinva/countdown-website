  "overview": "Set in the breath-taking coast of Ireland, Bad Sisters follows the lives of the Garvey sisters, who are bound together by the premature death of their parents and a promise to always protect one another. The tight-knit Garvey sisters have always looked out for each other. When their brother-in-law winds up dead, his life insurers launch an investigation to prove malicious intent - and set their sights on the sisters, all of whom had ample reason to kill him.",
