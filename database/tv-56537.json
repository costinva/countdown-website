  "overview": "Buffering follows Iain, a children's TV presenter with an aversion to kids and in an up and down relationship (mainly down) with TV producer Olivia. Iain's housemates Rosie, Greg, Ashley and Thalia, alongside Ashley's old flame Robbie, are all navigating that age where they're too old for nightclubs but too poor for mortgages.Â Part of a generation who are told they must live the perfect life, these friends discover it's not only ok but healthy to fail, over and over again.",
