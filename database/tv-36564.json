  "overview": "After the October 2016 revelation of the Access Hollywood tape that featured reality show host-turned-presidential candidate-turned President Trump making misogynist remarks, speculation ran rampant that other similar (or worse) tapes were \"out there\" â€” from The Apprentice outtakes and Miss Universe footage all the way to the infamous \"Russia dossier\" tape.Through it all, one determined man has contended that not only these tapes exist but they need to be seen and heard. The series follows Arnold as he uses his network of connections to search for the truth behind these elusive recordings of Trump. Along the way, he will look into the network of powerful people and companies who have kept these revelatory and potentially damaging recordings under lock and key.",
