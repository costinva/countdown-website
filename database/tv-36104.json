  "overview": "Landon Mondragon buys a neglected midcentury house in South Scottsdale, Arizona, with plans to transform the entire space into a handcrafted work of art. In order to transform this dark and closed-off house, Landon will need to tear out the walls, remodel the kitchen and update the bathrooms. Landon then decides to add a massive 700-square-foot master suite with a $50,000 price tag to get maximum value out of the home's unusually large lot size.",
