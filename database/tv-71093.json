  "overview": "With testimony from those closest to each case, #DEAD2ME will explore the stories of ten couples from all over Britain whose relationships were borne out of the digital age.While these relationships started promisingly enough, they would all take a turn for the tragic, and in each case a running commentary provided by their digital dialogue and postings reveals how and why.These shocking accounts draw upon intimate interviews with friends and family who witnessed these tragic events unfolding – but were powerless to prevent them – along with investigators, psychologists and digital experts.Pieced together with exclusive access to evidence critical to each case, such as social media posts, bodycam footage, text messages and chat history, each episode paints a vivid picture of a particular couple's unique story.",
