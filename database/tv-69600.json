  "overview": "In Ancient Camelhot, King Allfire and the Knights of the Square Table battle evil nights and protect their castle. It's mainly based around Flicker, a bright young dragon who hopes to become a night one day. He serves as a squire to Sir Longelot. His name speaks for himself. And is in love with the beautiful young princess Flame (who loves him in return.) And it's just a bunch of fun filled adventures of the dragons from \"Camelhot\"!",
