  "overview": "Hunter Moore was a self-proclaimed \"professional life ruiner\" who found fame in the early 2010s by founding IsAnyoneUp.com, a notorious â€˜revenge porn' hub. The site posted explicit photos of women and men, often without their permission and with devastating results. He built a cult following of those who hung on his every raunchy move. Featuring poignant, exclusive interviews with multiple women and men who fought to have their images taken down, law enforcement agents who worked the case and the crusader who fought to take Moore down, this three-part series documents his comeuppance at the hands of the only force more fearsome than an army of internet trolls: a mother protecting her daughter.",
