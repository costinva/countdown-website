  "overview": "Pavel is an ordinary young man whose father once left the family without explanation. But, instead of being angry with the parent, Pasha does not believe that dad could have done a bad deed on purpose and decides to investigate his disappearance, coming up with all sorts of theories, and checking their truth in the course of events. Life without a father turns out to be difficult - the boy is pressed by financial need, and he entangles with the crime boss Herman, who gives his ward small assignments for a good fee. One day, a bandit instructs Pasha to carry a bag of money, but during the trip, he loses it. Realizing that things are bad, the guy decides to try to find the bag on his own. The search leads him to a lunatic asylum.",
