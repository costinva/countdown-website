  "overview": "The Faithful is based on The Old Testament's Book of Genesis and told through the eyes of the courageous and passionate, yet flawed women whose descendants would shape three of the world's great faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Faithful is about discovering and losing love, the challenges of marriage, the joys and heartbreak of children, confronting temptation and finding faith.",
