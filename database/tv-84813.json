  "overview": "The story of the series takes place in the picturesque and somewhat sleepy town of Tichý Brod, surrounded by beautiful nature, whose peaceful atmosphere and relations between the inhabitants are disturbed by the brutal murder of an 11-year-old boy, Daniel. The investigation is led by local police captain Elena Mikušová (Gabriela Marcinková) together with her new colleague, Major Adam Hanzel (Tomáš Maštalír), whose aloof and socially inept approach initially complicates their cooperation. Gradually, however, they uncover not only the clues leading to the killer, but also the secrets that the town's inhabitants have been hiding from the others for years... The new series is a Slovak adaptation of the successful British format Broadchurch. The original series was a worldwide success and won millions of fans with its captivating story that reveals human fates and dark secrets against the backdrop of a shocking murder.",
