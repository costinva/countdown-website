  "overview": "Småstaden is about the small town of Larstad, where Sweden's youngest and most involuntary municipal council, Simon Hoffman, is commissioned to save the city from total decay. Together with his friends, Simon notes how the job disappears, people move away and cinemas, restaurants and cafes echo empty. How should the young council of municipalities deal with this complicated task, without any skills or lifeexperience?",
