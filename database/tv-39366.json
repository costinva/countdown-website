  "overview": "Paul Gigante leaves the FBI to be a detective for the rural Bakersfield, California P.D. But the sophisticated Gigante has more trouble trading opera for the Bakersfield Sound than he imagined. To his bored fellow officers, especially not-so-good old boy Denny Boyer, the professional, dedicated city slicker's way harder to figure out than even the most diabolical cow-napping.",
