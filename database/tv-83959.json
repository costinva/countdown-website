  "overview": "Early 2000s. Ksyusha arrives to conquer Moscow with a five—year-old child in her arms - without money, connections, or any prospects. There is no turning back — she ran away from her hometown, fleeing from her abusive husband. Her new friends help her survive in the capital: a diligent medical student, Olya, and a flighty Masha, who dreams of marrying a foreigner and going abroad. After 20 years, fate gives her friends another chance at happiness.",
