  "overview": "The young girl Moli who was about to enter high school, was struck by lightning while running late and was sent to Continent of Mingzu. What is this, so it's a Q version of a world?! What about the promised beautiful youth! Oh well, at least everyone is half beast~ I'll reluctantly join in for the time being! The status of a magician or some other heavy responsibilities like that, I don't want it. I just want to foolishly spend my sweet time being. Selfish!",
