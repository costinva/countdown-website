  "overview": "In Bargain Block New Orleans Keith and Evan will take their successful business model south for the winter to help communities restore abandoned homes to their former glory. The richly historic city will present unique restoration challenges for the couple, including repairing hurricane-damaged properties, bee infestations and strict construction codes that are vastly different from Detroit. Fortunately, Shea is always a phone call or a short flight away to help Keith and Evan when tricky business decisions arise, as are a few new local friends who will help the duo navigate the city's wild ways.  ",
