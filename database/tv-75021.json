  "overview": "It's 1998 and 17-year-old Videoland employee, HAYLEY, has just come out. Sort of. She's pretty sure she's a lesbian, but she needs help figuring out exactly what that entails. Naturally, working in a video store, she has access to a vast library of films, but finding meaningful representations in those films proves challenging. Evil lesbians, ambiguous lesbians or just no lesbians at all - how is Hayley supposed to become the best lesbian she can be, when there are no role models for her on-screen? With the help of her best friend TANYA, store manager MEL and co-worker DANIEL, Hayley must find a way to be herself, embrace her sexuality and impress the girl of her dreams.",
