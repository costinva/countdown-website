  "overview": "The Great Food Truck Race is headed to the Wild West, where host Tyler Florence welcomes seven teams of brand new food truck operators as they embark on the adventure of a lifetime. Just like the pioneers, they'll be using some of the West's most distinct ingredients in challenges that test their culinary skills. Each week, they'll race across the desert landscape to a new town where they'll face new challenges, cook incredible dishes and, as always, try to outsell the competition. The team that earns the least will have to walk away from the wagon trail, but the two teams that have the grit make it to the end will square off for the $50,000 prize.",
