  "overview": "The 1980s brought together a charming girl singer, a shy boy with an angelic voice, the heir of a famous thief, and the son of a famous Brazilian musician, forming the most important and \"superfantastic\" children's group in the history of Brazil. Now, some 40 years after their heyday, former members Simony, Tob, Mike and Jairzinho reunite to share memories of the band that marked generations.",
