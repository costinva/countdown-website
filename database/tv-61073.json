  "overview": "Denis Lawson stars at Kit Curran, a self-obsessed and somewhat renegade DJ at Radio Newtown - until he finds himself at odds with the new station boss. Kit Curran is rude, objectionable, somewhat of a con-man, and shows little more than contempt towards his colleagues and listeners. A real radio rogue, his show on commercial station Radio Newtown comes under fire from the new station manager, Roland Simpson, and loses his job at the end of Series 1. Series 2 sees Kit doing pretty much anything to make some cash - primarily in Brentford, performing house conversions and installing double-glazing as 'Curran Associates Incorporated'. Originally screened on ITV in 1984. A second series screened on Channel 4 in 1986, with the title reduced to simply Kit Curran.",
