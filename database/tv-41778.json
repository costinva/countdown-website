  "overview": "Hard Knocks brings together two private detectives with completely different styles, searching for bad guys in Los Angeles. The level-headed Gower (Bill Maher) and his tough-guy best friend Nick (Tommy Hinkley) open a private detective agency in Beverley Hills, trying to tap into the city's rich clientele. What they find each week is a town full of wackos with many problems that need solving.",
