  "overview": "What does it mean to be the greatest of all-time and how is that honor decided? In this series, Peyton Manning asks 100 experts in various categories to rank each contender using statistics, innovation and legacy as criteria. From Henry Ford, Jeff Bezos and Oprah to Evel Knievel, Harry Houdini and Johnny Knoxville, this fast-paced series puts ten G.O.A.T.s head-to-head in different categories each week, including toys, inventions, daredevils, sports cars, sports stadiums, candy, titans of industry and dynamic duos. Starting from number ten and leading up to the number one spot, viewers learn incredible facts as well as the history behind each followed by a vigorous debate. No ordinary countdown show, this is an exploration of the best of the best and their historical impact that we still feel today. At the end of each episode, of course, only one can be crowned the G.O.AT. Which will it be and will you agree?",
