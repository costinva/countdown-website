  "overview": "Antoine Verlay, an unlikeable police officer but a good investigator, and Florence Chassagne, a renowned yet neurotic art historian, are forced to work together on art trafficking. Antoine knows nothing about art, yet Florence frequently has conversations in her head with the late great dead painters..! To solve the crimes, the poorly matched duo must decipher the paintings to get to know the personality of the artist, and understand the motivations of the thief. A funny and exciting clash of cultures and crime capers ensueâ€¦",
