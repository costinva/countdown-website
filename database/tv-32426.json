  "overview": "When night falls and you're the only one at home, the coziest of houses can transform into a sinister, unfamiliar labyrinth. A noise in the yard or an unfamiliar shadow down the hall can send shivers down the spine, especially when you discover there is someone else in the house. In the suspense-filled new series Home Alone, a quiet suburban house becomes the setting for unimaginable horror. Highlighting stories of revengeful exes who refuse to disappear, the victims find that the walls around them are no longer a safe sanctuary.",
