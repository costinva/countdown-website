  "overview": "Magicians and psychics, occultists and mystics. They have accompanied the world throughout history, and sometimes changed its course. We will tell you about the fates of unusual people of the last century: the healer of the Romanov family Nizier Philippe, the poet-magician Valery Bryusov, the composer Alexander Scriabin, the Soviet fortune teller Juna and many others. Mysterious legends, mystical duels, musical apocalypse and incredible predictions - everything that the turbulent twentieth century is remembered for. Why have people always sought to touch the unknown? Who and how practices magic these days? And how do miracles coexist with technical progress?",
