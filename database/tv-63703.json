  "overview": "Anna is a successful lawyer who does not hesitate to tell her longtime friend Larisa that she wants to choose a \"husband for three months\", as she has a complex project and needs a lightning rod and constant sex. Two ideal options reached the final of her selection: a young technocrat-pedant and an age-old businessman-reveler. Both are successful, both are interesting, and both are passionate about her. However, suddenly Anna finds out that her life will sparkle with new and not the fact that with bright colors. She will become a grandmother. A son of a fool returns from England with a Pakistani daughter-in-law. So now Anna chooses not a \"husband for three months\", but a grandfather for her granddaughter.",
