  "overview": "Ginger, Earl Grey and Boba are three tea-party-loving Teddy Bears who have adventures with their friends in Tea Town. Ginger creates fashions and invitations, Earl Grey does the baking and tea-making and Boba makes things beautiful. With their flying teacup that transforms into a tea party table, they have tea parties in all kinds of places like the tops of trees, on the upstairs porch at Grandma's teapot and even in the clouds.",
