  "overview": "Aditya a.k.a. Adi is happily two-timing with Sophie and Sarah, each claiming to be his wife. His â€˜arrangement' with both women, often leads him to hilariously twisted situations, where his best friend and a wannabe rapper Yoyo steps up to save him, but ends up creating a new problem altogether. Adi's house turns into an insanely funny carnival of chaos, when other characters who are related to each of them drop by.",
