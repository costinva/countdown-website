  "overview": "The emperor was seriously ill, the prince was young, the rebels were plotting rebellion, and the army was approaching the city. Her country and family were about to be destroyed, so she wrote to the King of Nanchuan and begged him. As long as he could send troops to rescue her, she would agree to any request. He finally came and saved her and her husband and children. No matter how ruthless she was, he was still reluctant to part with her, but the price still had to be paid. What he wanted was never the throne in the world, but just one person.",
