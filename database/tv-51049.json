  "overview": "The playwright John Ashenden is recruited as a spy during the First World War by the British secret service but becomes increasingly disenchanted with the tasks he is given to perform. The start of each episode shows progressively more of an aged Ashenden living in France in the mid-1960s, reacting adversely to a piece of music on the radio.",
