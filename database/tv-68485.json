  "overview": "G'wed delves into the working class culture of \"surviving with a sense of humour\". The distinctive voice of Liverpool and the lived experience of the kids from the city will be at the heart of this comedy, tackling big issues like grief, sex, diversity and class differences with a wicked sense of humour.From Reece, the anti-hero at the heart of the show, a superficially misbehaving, potty-mouthed lad, who constantly surprises, whether that be quoting Mother Teresa, his knowledge of the work of John Steinbeck or his incredibly mature take on grief, to Aimee - ferociously determined, go-getting and emotionally mature â€“ G'wed showcases a part of the country, and a bunch of characters, that you rarely see on TV.",
