  "overview": "This Time with Alan Partridge will see Alan handed a career lifeline - the chance to stand in (temporarily) as co-host on This Time, an evening weekday magazine show. The show itself is a heady mix of consumer affairs, current affairs, viewer interaction, highbrow interview and lightweight froth; very much the sweet spots for a man whose CV boasts over two decades of weekday local radio. And with an array of diverse subjects on the agenda, it promises the perfect fit for a man whose broadcasting style has been described as â€˜equidistant between chitchat and analysis'.",
