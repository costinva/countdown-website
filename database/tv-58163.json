  "overview": "Bling delves into the dazzling world of jewellery and beyond; from buying and selling to making and fixing eye-catching pieces, figurines and more. In the show's very own Bling store, bling is king. It's a one-stop shop with four distinct counters, one dedicated to each process, with charismatic experts on hand to guide, advise and get the best deals. The series is full of heart-warming stories as excited couples seek that perfect wedding band, sell a hidden gem such as delicate jewellery, fix a much-loved family treasure, or even create a one-off bespoke item.",
