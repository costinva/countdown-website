  "overview": "The participants in the TV show are married couples who have a conflict with each other. Guests are connected to a lie detector. In addition to the presenter, the studio includes experts: a profiler is a specialist who can \"read\" a person's deception by his facial expressions and gestures, as well as polygraph examiners. During each episode, its characters ask each other questions in order to piece together or restore their relationship. Before starting the conversation, the presenter records heart rate data. These numbers are shown throughout, which helps determine the temperature of the discussion. Experts - Sabina Pantus and Roman Ustyuzhanin[2] - help determine whether a person is telling the truth when answering the next question. Also, to escalate the conflict, several other participants in the difficult situation are present in the auditorium. In the end, both sides must either reach a peaceful agreement or remain apart",
