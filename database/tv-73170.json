  "overview": "Prosecutor Shi Junfeng and assistant Chen Xue sank from the provincial procuratorate to the grassroots. Through handling the case, let the business of making and selling drug drinks be severely punished, let the girl bedroom be free from peeping, let the judicial broker be held accountable for fraud, let the students no longer indulge in the horrible script killing, and help the parties who can't get divorced to set up a family.",
