  "overview": "Hosted by Jason Priestley and featuring Xzibit, Chip Foose, Jeff Beck, Jay Leno and Tim Allen, Rides will take the viewer on a visual journey into the vehicular masterpieces... from designing and building, right into the passenger seat of the most extreme rides around! Hip Hop and modern rock n roll culture have bestowed upon us a stamp of funkiness and coolness, influencing everything from clothing and fashion to speech and television. Besides flaunting flashy diamonds and elaborate homes, their rides are often their real pride and joy... Enthusiasts will love footage of the rides on the road and their incredible journey to art form. Included are detailed glimpses into the engines, interiors, and exteriors. We ll also take the viewer to some of the hottest places to accessorise while checking out the latest in technology, whether that be a stompin audio or bumpin hydraulics. Few people ever receive the opportunity to explore these vehicles this close-up!",
