  "overview": "A fallen top police officer and an aspiring young public prosecutor have two very different motives for opening a closed murder case. But when they do, it turns out to be Pandora's box. As the bloody trail seems to lead them ever deeper into the police and the justice system, both parties suspect a conspiracy. Or does it all come back to a terrorist attack that shook the town 18 months ago?",
