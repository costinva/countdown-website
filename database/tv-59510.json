  "overview": "Dancing with Myself, from Irwin Entertainment, is the ultimate family-friendly high-spirited competition that brings out the performer in all of us.Every week a new group of fun-loving dancers from all walks of life and of all ages compete in a series of high-energy dance challenges that are designed and demonstrated by the show's celebrity creators, including Shakira. Isolated in their own pods, contestants have a short time to learn the new routines, add their unique flare and then perform their hearts out in front of a live audience.  As each round of the competition progresses, Shakira and her judging panel provide instant feedback and encouragement, but, ultimately, it's the studio audience that decides who wins Best Dancer of the Night and gets to take home the cash prize.",
