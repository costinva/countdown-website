  "overview": "With the most difficult days of confinement as a backdrop, the series narrates eight crossed stories in which a character acts as a common link between them. Javi, a nursing assistant, acts as an intermediary between patients and their families during the coronavirus pandemic. With the desire to soften the trance for both parties, Javi begins to embellish the messages to alleviate those difficult moments, all while longing for a movie love: that of Dr. Cabanas, a distant professional who does not have time to Javier's romanticism.",
