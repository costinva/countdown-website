  "overview": "A murder, lives shattered, pain, grief and a woman alone in danger. A vision, a door that closes without being crossed... Divided between reality and desire... Because all he took with him was love... We are on the roof of an abandoned building where two bodies lie there with their guns next to them. They seem to have shot each other. The blue police beacons are flashing and the officers are isolating the crime scene.",
