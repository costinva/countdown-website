  "overview": "Hosted by Bachelorette star Tyler Cameron and Brooklyn-based interior designer Delia Kenza, Barkitecture is a dog lifestyle series for the goodest (and fanciest) boys. It captures the lifestyles of dog-loving, dog-obsessed people who are gifting their beloved fur-babies with the most ridiculously extravagant dog houses imaginable. In each episode, the hosts work with doggie parents to build a fully customized dog house that redefines sitting in the lap of luxury.",
