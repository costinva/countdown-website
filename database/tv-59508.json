  "overview": "In the life of fire inspector Natalya Kustova, everything is fine - each inspection ends with a serious jackpot. For the sake of profit, she will stop at nothing: she will undress even her own brother and sister. Kustova thinks that everything in life can be bought: solid friends, an apartment, premium brand clothes and a handsome boyfriend. But she is mistaken... During a routine examination, it turns out that Natalya urgently needs a healthy kidney. She has three months to find a donor. And this is just the beginning, because where there is one kidney, there are seventy-one - especially if the object of your sudden passion needs the 72nd.",
