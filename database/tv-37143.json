  "overview": "I Am a Killer gives a fascinating and in-depth insight into the stories of prisoners on death row in America, awaiting their fate. Showing that there are multiple sides to every story, each episode profiles prisoners convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The series features never before seen footage with extraordinary access to prisons across America. Each convicted prisoner recounts the events that led up to their crime and, shockingly, the event itself. We discover their motivations, their expectations and ultimately how they now view the crime, after time spent on death row. Different viewpoints and the impact of decisions made in a split second that have changed the course of the killers' lives throw into question the viewer's opinions towards the killers.",
