  "overview": "Designer and mom of two, Veronica Valencia and her team, will meet with clients to learn about their family background and meaningful moments from their past. In each episode, she'll consult with a genealogist to learn more about her clients' cultural identity and create a life-size mood board inspired by the aesthetic details of their family story. Veronica and her expert team consisting of design guru Tommy Rouse, master builder David Bohler and talented artist Joshua Smith will then transform the home, creating beautiful and modern spaces that honor the family's cultural heritage. She also will include special heirloom projects, such as artwork and artifacts, that weave the homeowners' personal legacy into the overall design.",
