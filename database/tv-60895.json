  "overview": "Taxi driver Vincent and his 18-year-old daughter Anna drift through Munich while capitalism slowly dissolves around them. Vincent has to accept that he is no longer needed: his job is dying and his daughter wants nothing to do with him. Anna finds her way around on her own â€“ she always has. But the apocalyptic events of a fateful Oktoberfest night lead to their paths crossing again. How far are you willing to go as the world spirals out of control?",
