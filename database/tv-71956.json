  "overview": "The Australian Army Training Team fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the South Vietnamese Army during the Vietnam War. The Team was Australia's first unit to enter the war, advising the South Vietnamese forces and working alongside the CIA to raise an indigenous guerrilla force. With many telling their stories for the first time, they bear the physical and psychological scars of that combat.",
