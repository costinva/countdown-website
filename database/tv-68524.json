  "overview": "Nan Fei and Qi Jia Yi are a pair of besties who are both over 30 years old and facing societal pressures for women. Nan Fei's boyfriend Chen Fang is going through a career change and he is hesitant about marriage. In a story that follows the lives of two contemporary women over 30, Nan Fei and her boyfriend Chen Fang are a couple whose relationship is on the rocks. He is busy with his career and hesitant to get married. Furthermore, troubles from the ex-wife and family problems exacerbate the situation. On the eve of her wedding, Qi Jia Yi suddenly realizes that marriage should be for love rather than security. She then bids goodbye to her selfish and snobbish husband, and finally meets her true love in Jiao Yue. However, she is unsure about moving forward with him because of her inferiority complex. Meanwhile, Nan Fei treks to poverty-stricken areas to help people who were born with defects or were injured but did not have the money for plastic surgery regain their confidence. Through working together on a home renovation, Qi Jia Yi and Jiao Yue gradually develop feelings for each other. After thousands of turns, Nan Fei and Chen Fang as well as Qi Jia Yii and Jiao Yue learn to see their hearts clearly and realize the true meaning of a better life.  ",
