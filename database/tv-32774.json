  "overview": "Four people living together in an apartment can give rise to a lot of funny situations, especially if they are as different as these four: Fredrik is the nominal apartment owner, a bit superior to the others, currently \"between two jobs\". His girlfriend Cilla would prefer that they lived there alone, without Fredrik's crude brother Jan-Olof or the young cab driver Anton.",
