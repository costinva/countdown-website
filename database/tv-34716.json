  "overview": "Supported by a large pool of guest actors, Carry Goossens and Jan Van Dyke (and originally also Gaston Berghmans) star in a series of short, often stereotypical comedy sketches. These quickies are supplemented with some longer serials that return every episode. The adventures of two clumsy handymen are shown in \"Sus &amp; Klus\", while in \"Tommeke\" a funny ginger rascal continuously makes his mother end up in total embarrassment.",
