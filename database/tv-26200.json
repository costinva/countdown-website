  "overview": "Oslo Airport (OSL) is Norway's main airport with tens of millions of travelers each year. This makes the airport the second largest in Scandinavia. Every day and night 15000 people work to keep the airport running 24 hours a day. These people face daily emergencies, prisoners, thieves, finding contraband and ensuring that it is safe for passengers and crew to travel. In other words, in OSL 7-24 we get a unique and exclusive insight into the action-packed life of Norway's busiest airport.",
