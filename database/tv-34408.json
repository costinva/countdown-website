  "overview": "Based on the British sitcom with the same name, Catastrophe starts with a one-night standâ€”an encounter that is not meant to have a future. Audrey, a Quebecer and Frank, an American who is a Francophile, experience the most intense six days of their lives. A few weeks later, Frank gets a phone call from Audrey: he finds out that she is pregnant. The couple decides to have a go at parenting together, despite knowing each other very little.",
