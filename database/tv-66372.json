  "overview": "Following a personal tragedy, forensic anthropologist Dr. David Hunter left his career as a police consultant and settled down as a general practitioner in a small town in Norfolk, England. When a murder occurs there, in which a severely mutilated woman's body is found, the local police turn to him with a request for help. Hunter has reservations about getting involved. When a second woman is murdered, the townsfolk tear each other up with suspicions - and \"newcomer\" Hunter is also blamed.",
