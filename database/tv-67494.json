  "overview": "Saengtai never believed in destiny or things such as ‘Soulmate' but rather in his ability to make his own choices. In every rainfall, the sound around him silences, making way for the voice of his soulmate to be heard. On the other hand, ‘Phat' patiently waited for the unfamiliar voice but had never been fortunate enough to hear it. Even in the midst of a downpour, the voice of his soulmate was elusive. Their differing beliefs were like a game of tug-of-war played in the rain, with a rope of fate pulled by a stubborn person trying to win the other's heart and a denying person trying to escape the truth. If destiny played a role, would Saengtai be able to go against the will, or would it be Phat, who had been played by destiny?",
