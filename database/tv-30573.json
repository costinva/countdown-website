  "overview": "Kelsey Grammer Presents: The Sketch Show is packed with laughs every minute literally! The series' signature quick-fire puns, gags and sketches will showcase the comedic talents of five distinctive performers: Kaitlin Olsen, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Paul F. Tompkins, Malcolm Barrett and original UK cast member Lee Mack. The unpredictable and swift-moving sketches sometimes last mere seconds as they deliver popular one-liners. Featuring a remarkable average of 30 vignettes per half hour, The Sketch Show is a refreshing change - irreverent, smart and silly, and never slow.",
