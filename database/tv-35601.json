  "overview": "Laila Bagge wants to get the most out of life. She wants to be a good mom, carry out all her dreams, constantly take on new projects, have fun, develop, help others, feel loved and have deep relationships. With very many balls in the air at the same time it can easily be chaos, but after all she is (almost) always in control. At the end of the day there is only one thing that is really important to her; family. We are following Laila Bagge, who dares to share his privacy more than ever before, and the son of Liam, whose life revolves around studies, martial arts, family and friends. ",
