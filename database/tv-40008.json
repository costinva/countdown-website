  "overview": "A close group of friends share joys and sorrows, but their friendship is tested over the years. The six are constantly struggling with the challenges of their generation. In Dertigers the life of a close-knit group of friends of six people in their thirties is central. Pieter, Nora, Tinne, Bart, Alex and Saartje have been friends since their student days in Antwerp. The six grapple with the challenges of their generation, the balance between work and family andâ€¦ the secrets of an unresolved trauma that ties them together inseparably but that also threatens to tear them apart.",
