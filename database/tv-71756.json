  "overview": "Lost Women of Highway 20 is a sprawling, true-crime odyssey that begins with the disappearance of a 13-year-old Rachanda Pickle. When Rachanda disappears in 1990, detectives discover a trail of missing and murdered women along a ghostly stretch of Oregon's US Highway 20 that goes back for decades, leading them to a killer who has been hiding in plain sight. With narration from Spencer, Lost Women of Highway 20 is a gripping documentary that asks poignant questions of our society's treatment of women - then and now.",
