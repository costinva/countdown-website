  "overview": "Pink Collar Crimes is an outrageous true-crime series inspired by a growing crime wave in the country: felonious females. These are the impossible-to-believe, often absurd, true stories about the most unexpected women – PTA moms, country-club chairwomen, and more – who took big risks, pocketed big cash and then served hard time. Each episode includes insight and analysis from prosecutor, author, and television correspondent Marcia Clark.",
