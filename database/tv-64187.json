  "overview": "Ghosts of Time follows 4 kids who meet Theo, a mischievous and eccentric old ghost. He's trapped in his derelict mansion unless he returns his stolen antiques to the rightful owners he stole them from in the first place. Whenever the kids and Theo touch the stolen antique, they get transported back in time. Then the fun begins as they have to figure out who the piece belongs to and return the artifact. When the kids time travel, they too take on ghostly powers, which takes some getting used to!",
