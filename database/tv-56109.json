  "overview": "31 year old Omota Uramichi is the gymnastics coach in the children's educational TV program \"Together with Mama.\" He might be sweet on the outside, but all boys and girls are inevitably scared off whenever they get a glimpse of the adult darkness that's the result of Uramichi-sensei's emotional instability. This is a tragic eulogy to all the \"boys and girls\" who are now adults!",
