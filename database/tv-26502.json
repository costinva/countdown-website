  "overview": "They rarely appear in public and do not want to expose their lives for show. They are successful businessmen, owners of multi-millionaire states, heads of large Russian companies and holders of controlling stakes. And they are ready to share their fortune with those who really need it.In the unprecedented reality of the TV channel \"Friday!\" Multimillionaires will hide under the guise of homeless vagrants, spend the night in shelters, work in factories and beg for alms in the streets. Sharks of business will plunge into the harsh realities of other people's everyday life, to learn the needs of ordinary people and to sacrifice considerable sums to the needy.Look, maybe this tramp, street musician or seller on the market is the \"Secret millionaire\" who is ready to give big money to someone who, in his opinion, is actually worthy of it.",
