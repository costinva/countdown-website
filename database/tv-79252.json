  "overview": "Mishima, a student living in a remote countryside, was being bullied by the boys in his class. The reason? Because Mishima \"seemed gay.\" In reality, Mishima did like men, but he had no way to resist, and secretly dressing up as a woman was his only solace. One day, as Mishima was enjoying his usual alone time on the rooftop, he happened to witness Kirino, the leader of the bullying group, holding the lipstick Mishima thought he had lost. Kirino was secretly trying to apply the lipstick that Mishima had used to his own lips. A youth story that boys, who sought a place where they could be their â€˜true selves' somewhere in this world, want to convey the most right now.",
