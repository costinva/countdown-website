  "overview": "Royals at War examines the strategies used by the royal families of Europe during World War II in the face of increasingly powerful nationalist parties. Connected by family ties, the families witnessed the rise of power of Fascism and Nazism and found themselves, voluntarily or involuntarily, at the centre of Hitler's political scheming. The two episodes will recount the various families' ambiguous and difficult dealings with these.",
