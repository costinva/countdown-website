  "overview": "Valley of the Damned examining seven murders that rocked the beautiful, desolate mountain region of Fremont County, deep in the Colorado Rockies. This vast, inhospitable region of Southern Colorado is known as Prison Valley because it is home to 15 prisons including America's only Federal Supermax. This valley has more correctional facilities than any other in the US, so in a town where you're surrounded by prisons, how does someone get away with murder? ",
