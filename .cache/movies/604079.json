  "overview": "Every year, fifty teenage boys meet for an event known throughout the country as \"The Long Walk.\" Among this year's chosen crop is \"Maine's Own,\" Ray Garraty. He knows the rules: that warnings are issued if you fall under speed, stumble, sit down. That after three warnings - you get your ticket. And what happens then serves as a chilling reminder that there can be only one winner in the Walk. The one that survives.",
