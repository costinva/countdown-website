  "overview": "We follow the artist Markoolio and his mother Irma in their everyday life. When it turns out that Irma's cottage on Ingar√∂ in the Stockholm archipelago, (which Marko bought for her so that she would be free from alcohol) is moldy, they decide to build a new one. It will be a house-builder's journey edged by their Finnish hot temper, but also a lot of laughter, pranks and unexpected meetings on the construction site.",
