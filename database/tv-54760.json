  "overview": "Having known each other since they were young, Tu Si Yi and Lin Zheng Zheng were originally a happy couple. When Tu Si Yi debuted as an idol, fame got in the way of their relationship and they drove them apart. Tu Si Yi starts endorsing a game and suddenly gets trapped inside it to become the 3rd prince and protagonist of the story. To save her boyfriend, Lin Zheng Zheng enters the game as a player and realizes that she is the 3rd princess and the villain. With only the three lives allotted in the game, Lin Zheng Zheng must assist Tu Si Yi in becoming king. However, Tu Si Yi has lost all of his memories and considers Zheng Zheng to be his biggest enemy. His subconscious also has no interest in the throne as he enjoys the music instead. Will the two ever find their way out of the game and into each other's arms again? (Source: chinesedrama.info) ",
