  "overview": "Thomas Numme, Harald Rønneberg and two other friends send Truls Svendsen on a number of fun assignments along the Norwegian coast in Truls - Oppdrag Hurtigruten. Before Truls can board the Hurtigruten in Bergen, he must go through a hefty safety course which, among other things, involves a drop of thirty meters with a lifeboat. The trip later goes to Florø where he learns beer brewing at Kinn Brewery and to Stadt where surfing puts Truls' physics to the test. On Måløy there will be spectacular nature experiences, and on Herøy Truls will be commissioned to play the main role in a historical game.",
