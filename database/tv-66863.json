  "overview": "Chanshi is a young religious girl from the Jewish community in Brooklyn who decides, just before her wedding and despite her family's objections, to abandon everything familiar to her and immigrate to Israel. In the Holy Land, Chanshi embarks on a wild and reckless journey, but the transition from a life with a clear set of rules to a life without any rules at all, is not at all what she was expecting and throws her into a whirlwind of life experiences.",
