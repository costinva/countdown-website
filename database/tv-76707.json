  "overview": "Trond and Rune were born and raised by the coast, and love everything it offers in terms of exciting experiences and wonderful ingredients. The mountain goat Margit, on the other hand, gets seasick just at the thought, and with the boys as teachers, she gets to try everything that a land crab can't really do anything about. Together they will seek out culinary experiences along the southern coast. \"Kystmat\" with Rune &amp; Margit &amp; Moi offers spontaneous comedy, magnificent nature, exciting experiences and master cooking in a delightful mix.",
