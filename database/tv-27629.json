  "overview": "Heimat is a trilogy of episodic films by Edgar Reitz which views life in Germany between 1919 and 2000 through the eyes of a family from the Hunsr√ºck area of the Rhineland. Personal and domestic life is set against glimpses of wider social and political events. The title Heimat is a German word meaning \"homeland\". Its use is partly an ironic reference to the film genre known as Heimatfilm which was popular in Germany in the 1950s. Heimatfilms were noted for their rural settings, sentimental tone and simplistic morality.",
