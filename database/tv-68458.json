  "overview": "Often we do not think about why the chair is in the farthest corner of the room, and on the wall there is a painting donated by someone that you have never liked. Olga Agdasi, a space psychologist, is convinced that these and other subjects have a direct impact on our lives. Often, they do not allow us to leave our comfort zone and build another reality around ourselves. Therefore, a psychologist will give advice on how to change the space in order to fulfill dreams and achieve their goals, and a professional designer will put ideas into practice.",
