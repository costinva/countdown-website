  "overview": "Superhuman is an hour-long unscripted competition series that tests the abilities of ordinary people to use their extraordinary skills. The episodes were picked up following a two-hour special which aired Jan. 4, 2016. Kal Penn will return as host for the all-new episodes. Online casting calls have begun for individuals who possess distinct, nearly super-human abilities in fields such as memory, hearing, taste, touch, smell and sight. For anyone looking to showcase their remarkable talents - take this first step by registering on the casting website at fox.com/superhuman/superhuman-casting. The original special featured 12 ordinary people with extraordinary skills competing for a grand prize of $100,000. Penn, along with a guest panel, provided insights and comedic commentary about the competitors' unique abilities, while guiding the studio audience, who ultimately decided who took home the title of â€˜Superhuman' and the $100,000 grand prize.",
