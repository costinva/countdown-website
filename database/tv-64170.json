  "overview": "Hosted by The Boulet Brothers, this spin-off series of The Boulet Brothers' Dragula stars monster drag artists from the show's previous seasons returning to the competition for a chance to win a $100,000 grand prize and the title of Dragula's first Titan. Each week the returning drag monsters must compete in makeup, costume creation, and performance based challenges to prove that they are the best of the best, while the weakest among them must face terrifying physical feats or risk elimination until only the true Titan of Dragula remains.Â ",
