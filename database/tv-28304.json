  "overview": "The Shocking Truth digs deep into notorious real-life murders and crimes and explores how Hollywood turned them into its most memorable thrillers. The behind-the-scenes stories of how these gruesome events became unforgettable movies is as fascinating as the true crimes themselves. Through cinematic re-enactments and exclusive interviews with the writers, directors and cast members, as well as the detectives, attorneys, and criminologists who investigated the actual crimes, we lay out a compelling story line â€” how despicable wrong doings became art, creating moments etched in our pop culture.",
