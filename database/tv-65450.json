  "overview": "We meet Ana Escudero in Miami with her entire family in a two-story house until one fateful night when Ana's entire world crashes down on top of her. In the grand debut of the telenovela, the rash Ignacio Bustamante destroyed Ana's life when he runs over her brother while he is trying to change the tire to his car. To cover up the accident, Ignacio purposely throws a sleeping gas bomb into her house while her mom and brother's fiance are inside and then sets the house on fire. Everyone believes it was Ana who died. Her brother, who was in a coma, came out of it, but paralyzed. Afraid for their lives, they move to New York for two years before Fabian dies of an aneurism. Because of this, Ana vows revenge on the Butstamante family and takes on a new persona. Unknowingly, at the same time, Ana meets the brother of Ignacio named Gustavo, the son who had been disowned by his father for refusing to go into the family business and wanting to pursue an acting career. Ana falls in love with Gustavo, not realizing that he's part of the family that she wants to seek revenge on.",
