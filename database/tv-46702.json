  "overview": "Julia is inspired by Julia Child's extraordinary life and her show The French Chef, which essentially invented food television. Through Julia and her singular can-do spirit, it explores an evolving time in American history â€“ the emergence of a new social institution called public television, feminism and the women's movement, the nature of celebrity, and America's cultural growth. At its heart, the show is a portrait of a marriage with an evolving and complicated power dynamic.",
