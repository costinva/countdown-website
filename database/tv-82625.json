  "overview": "The Klyachev family lives in the picturesque town of the Golden Ring: writer Anton Pavlovich, his son Leonid, a blacksmith, and grandson Prometheus, who works as a lifeguard. The Larin family lives in the same city: taxi driver Valentina Petrovna, her daughter is a tour guide Sveta, and her granddaughter is an artist Julia. Prometheus is convinced that Julia is a fraud. He uncovers one of her scams and turns her over to the police. Their meeting becomes fateful not only for the characters themselves, but also for their relatives, who no longer hoped for personal happiness.",
