  "overview": "The cognitive program Funny English is the most fun and easy way to learn how to speak English. Everyone has long known that it is easier for kids to learn a foreign language if the lesson is built in the form of a game, when all the child's attention is focused on what is happening. The more interesting the game and the brighter the impression of it, the faster and easier it is to remember incomprehensible words and boring grammar rules. In this project, a children's language telecourse, a game and an exciting adventure, which help make learning English easy, fun and entertaining, have been wonderful combined.",
