  "overview": "In the wake of every murder, clues appear. Some are easy to spot, and some are well-hidden. In each episode of Murder Decoded, we tell the forensics-driven stories of committed investigators finding the tiniest trace evidence, using cutting-edge science to understand its relevance, and deciphering which clues mean nothing and which ones will put a killer behind bars all to bring justice to victims' loved ones.",
