  "overview": "An engrossing mystery unfolds set in the remote northwest of Ireland, Crá, follows Garda Conall Ó Súilleabháin as he searches for justice in the most personal of cases—the murder of his own mother, Sabine, whose body is discovered 15 years after her disappearance. Forbidden from joining the investigation, Conall partners with a determined young journalist, Ciara-Kate, who is using her true-crime podcast to expose the village's deepest secrets. As they unravel the truth, they must confront a community bound by silence and its own moral codes.",
