  "overview": "As a doctor, Zhang Du Hang is far from impressed with Lu Yang as he finds her to be overly rational and calm. Lu Yang actually shares a similar contempt for his methods which she finds to be from the wild. They are both transferred to the same department leaving them no choice but to cooperate with each other in the face of urgent situations like a merchant ship in distress, transnational disaster relief, a virus epidemic and anti-terrorism efforts. Their story is an ode to the contemporary Chinese navy.",
