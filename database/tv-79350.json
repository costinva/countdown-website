  "overview": "Vyacheslav Tretyakov is a superstar of modern Russian cinema. The perfect picture is spoiled only by the devastating reviews of the blogger-film critic Nikita Kislyak. Tretyakov tries to force Kislyak to delete the video and breaks into a public fight. To restore her reputation and avoid trial, the star will have to fulfill the condition of the hated film critic — forgetting about pride and large contracts, play the main role in an unknown provincial theater.",
