  "overview": "Once upon a time, there was a witch named Elaina, who set off on a journey across the world. Along the way, she would meet all kinds of people, from a country full of witches to a giant in love with his own musclesâ€”but with each meeting, Elaina would become a small part of their story, and her own world would get a little bit bigger.
