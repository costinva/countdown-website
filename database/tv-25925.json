  "overview": "Filmed over four months in one general hospital, Confessions of a Junior Doctor follows the lives of young doctors trying to cope with the pressures of the profession at a critical time for our health service.Northampton General Hospital could be any hospital in Britain. Hard-working staff serve a local population that is increasing, but the hospital has little money for more beds or more doctors. The 210 junior doctors working here range from first year recruits – fresh out of medical school – to senior registrars on the cusp of becoming consultants. All of them are trying to give the best possible care and balance work with the rest of their lives. Northampton opened its doors to the film crews to show how the hospital – and the juniors they support – are working against the odds to do the best job they can.",
