  "overview": "SurrealEstate revolves around real estate agent Luke Roman and an elite team of specialists who handle the cases that no one else can: haunted and possessed houses that literally scare would-be buyers away. Researching, investigating and \"fixing\" the things that go bump in the night, the team works to create closure — and closings — as they struggle with demons of their own.",
