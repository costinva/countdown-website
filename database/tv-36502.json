  "overview": "One of the greatest artists of all time, the legacy of Leonardo daVinci (1452-1519) includes some of the most well-known paintings ever made. But daVinci's talent exceeded far beyond painting - he was also a successful architect and engineer, and his drawings of military weapons have been highly regarded and studied for nearly 500 years. These drawings capture exceptionally engineered weapons unlike anything that had been developed at the time they were created, yet there is no record that these designs were ever constructed ... until now. Discovery Channel's world premiere original series, Doing Da Vinci, puts a team of 21st century builders, engineers and historians together to take on one of history's greatest minds as they attempt to build daVinci's weapons once and for all.",
