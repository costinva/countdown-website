  "overview": "Zeus: King of the gods, ruler of the world. He's cruel, stylish and all-powerful. That is, until he's not.Having long enjoyed his status as king of the gods, Zeus's reign has never been truly threatened. That is until he wakes up one morning and discovers a wrinkle on his forehead. Believing it to be the harbinger of an ancient prophecy which foretells his destruction, neurosis sets in: Zeus becomes convinced his fall is coming. As his paranoia takes hold, the god of gods - seeing signs everywhere - starts to dangerously self-destruct.And he's right to be worried. Zeus's one time friend and now prisoner, Prometheus, is orchestrating a plan to bring him down. The plan involves three disparate humans, all of whom are totally unaware of their cosmic significance or the part they must play in saving the world. No pressure. (Some pressure.)",
