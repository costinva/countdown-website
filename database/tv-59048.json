  "overview": "The Consultant is a darkly comedic workplace thriller exploring the power dynamics between employer and employee, asking how far workers will go to get ahead. When a failing business hires a consultant to streamline their business practices, they assume everything will be fine — an easy, painless process — only to discover that the odd Mr. Patoff has gained an immense amount of power in a short period of time, invading employees' lives and quickly becoming more of a menace than anyone could have anticipated. ",
