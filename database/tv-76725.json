  "overview": "Each week, chance will designate a participant as the Power Player, who will have all the powers in the house and will decide who sleeps where, who eats what, who has this privilege or that handicap. But he will have to keep his identity secret at all costs. At the end of the week, the Power Player will designate the player who will be eliminated. Unless he unmasks the Power Player, in which case it is the latter who will be eliminated! Between strategies, alliances and low blows, who will be able to tame power?",
