  "overview": "The World Poker Tour features a collection of prestigious tournaments played in top casinos and card rooms across the globe, including the glamorous Bellagio in Las Vegas and the Aviation Club de France in Paris. It all leads up to the WPT Championship finale where the \"survivor\" walks away with more than $1 million. But that's just a fraction of the money up for grabs over the course of the series. The WPT widened the television audience for poker by injecting cutting-edge television production values into the dramatic world of high-stakes, upscale, tournament poker with its innovative WPT cams revealing the player's hole cards.",
