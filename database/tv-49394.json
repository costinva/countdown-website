  "overview": "Every summer, about twenty teenagers go for a month to a rehabilitation camp in the middle of nature: Albanta, a remote place far from everything they know so far, where they face their fears and traumas. Gonzalo spent a month there and when he left, he committed suicide. A year later, his sister Olivia decides to enter the camp in search of the reasons that led to him taking his own life. But it seems that Albanta has other plans for her and for the rest of its inhabitants.",
