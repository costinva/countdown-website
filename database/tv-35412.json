  "overview": "James Corden's Next James Corden takes Corden from late night to the world of a fictional reality competition show to find a young up-and-comer to be his Late Late Show successor. While Corden is by no means leaving The Late Late Show anytime soon, he knows that someday, years and years from now, he'll have to hand over the reins to a new host, and he wants ample time to select and groom a worthy successor.",
