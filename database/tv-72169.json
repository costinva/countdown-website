  "overview": "May, New Year, birthdays — the Pyzhov family celebrates everything together. The daughters have already matured and bring their grooms to the house, who are trying their best to please the head of the family. He, in turn, believes that no man in the world is worthy of his daughters, and is constantly looking for flaws in guys. Everyone has their own character and beliefs, but the mother finds an excuse to gather everyone at the table to discuss news and problems. Every meeting is just a holiday, but the main thing is to survive it and not quarrel until the next one!",
