  "overview": "It centers on a headquarters of the Valais cantonal police. Their work is usually confined to contemplative trifles: runaway sheep, recalcitrant traffic offenders and presence at village festivals. But suddenly, an unbelievable murder attempt wakes the police officers from their deep sleep. Finally something is happening. But before the Tschugger (dialect for \"policemen\") can jump on the case, the federal police officer Annette is already ready and takes over. The local police chief, Biffiger, appears cooperative on the surface, but his heart beats for his police station, and he knows from experience that not everything from Bern can be trusted. The mismatched Tschugger duo Bax, the wannabe cowboy, and Pirmin, the phlegmatic one, investigate parallel to the federal police officer and use the home advantage. \"Tschugger\" is a comedy caught between exaggerated boredom, village festival charm, dramatic depth, explosive pseudoaction and raclette smell.Â ",
