  "overview": "Based on the web comedy series \"Who...\", Beauty and the Baller is a single-camera comedy series about a pro athlete and his hot down-to-earth wife and what their life is like off of the court. Despite their fame and fortune, at the end of the day John and Deena Castle are just like any other couple when it comes to resolving problems, managing family and friends, and making sure the love that brought them together keeps them together. An Emmy-winning tv producer, creator Michael Ajakwe Jr.-- also the founder of the Los Angeles Web Series Festival, the world's first and most popular all-web fest-- is determined to bring both audiences together by demonstrating the impact New Media storytelling can have on traditional storytelling through the process of adaptation by, essentially, experimenting on his own creation.",
