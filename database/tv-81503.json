  "overview": "LUMINARE CHRISTMAS! creates a magical atmosphere that's perfect for all ages, fueled by sonically lush vocal and instrumental musical performances. Their iconic sound can be described as a combination of Mannheim Steamroller's classic holiday vibes, with the high-energy rock of Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and the stirring cinematic atmosphere of Hans Zimmer. The end result is a musical fusion for the senses that is sure to captivate audiences.",
