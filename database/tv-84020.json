  "overview": "Bob Stewart's popular game show franchise includes \"The New $25,000 Pyramid\" with Dick Clark hosting a daily daytime broadcast for CBS. The CBS network at the time of Pyramid's debut and continuing through 1982 had a winnings limit of $25,000 anyways. Since Bob Stewart packaged a weekly syndicated Pyramid game show with the same amount, and because of the winnings limit for the network, the Subsequent Syndicated Spinoffs awarded an even higher amount, via a tournament of champions. At the same time, CBS continued to order more episodes through 1988.",
