  "overview": "Solving a murder is like putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle. Sometimes, the pieces snap into place with ease and other times, they don't fit. In Dead Reckoning, the police must meticulously reconstruct the puzzle. Once all the pieces are found, investigators must then figure out how everything fits together, crack the case and bring justice for the victim.",
