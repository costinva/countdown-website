  "overview": "Girl Scout Cookie Championship is a baking competition dedicated to the perennial sweet treat! Host Alyson Hannigan, of How I Met Your Mother fame, will oversee the contest, while Nacho Aguirre and Katie Lee are set to judge the bakers, alongside a rotating third panel member, including Carla Hall. This gotta-see-it showdown is unlike any other cookie battle you've experienced before. The competitors must transform the Girl Scout Cookies you know and love (Thin Mints and Samoas and Trefoils, oh my!) into over-the-top edible art. The name of the game is flavor, of course, plus showstopping design and undeniably impressive creativity.",
