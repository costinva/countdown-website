  "overview": "After Boss and Jued go through love failures, Boss suggests Jued that she come to work at Break Up Service, a company that specializes in breaking up couples. Initially, they dislike each other, as they each played a role in the other's past breakups. However, as Jued proves her skills through hard work, Boss eventually acknowledges her competence. She begins to enjoy her job, relishing the role of a manipulator in relationshipsâ€”destroying others' romances becomes her way of venting her frustration over her own failed love life. As they continue working together, Boss realizes he is falling for Jued. But Jued doesn't share his feelings. What will happen to their partnership and their mission to break up other couples?",
