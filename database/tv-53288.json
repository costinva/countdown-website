  "overview": "Professional darts Eddie is in a crisis. Fame gone, money gone, wife gone and physical fitness also leaves much to be desired. With the help of his old buddy Nobbe, who is also a rusty dart professional, but with a strong tendency towards alcohol, Eddie wants to find his way back into life and his career and to prove that he was not called \"the wasp\" for nothing. Easier said than done. Before \"the wasp\" can stab reliably again, Eddie first has to take the path of self-knowledge and overcome some setbacks.",
