  "overview": "Every day, countless adults utilize the internet with insidious intentions to groom, sexually exploit, and abuse children online. Committed to helping law enforcement stop these perpetrators, child advocate Roo Powell and the team at her nonprofit organization SOSA (Safe from Online Sex Abuse) work in collaboration with law enforcement to detect and identify the menacing adults who use the internet to harm children. Undercover Underage follows Roo as the 38-year-old mother of three transforms her appearance into a teen online. Once adults engage with Roo's underage decoys, it's a race against the clock to gather enough information to positively identify the offenders and get them on law enforcement's radar.",
