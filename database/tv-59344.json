  "overview": "Tulsa King follows New York mafia capo Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi, just after he is released from prison after 25 years and unceremoniously exiled by his boss to set up shop in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Realizing that his mob family may not have his best interests in mind, Dwight slowly builds a \"crew\" from a group of unlikely characters, to help him establish a new criminal empire in a place that, to him, might as well be another planet.Â ",
