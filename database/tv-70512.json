  "overview": "About what leads to sex, and what happens immediately after it. In one of the novels, a guy agrees to have a child with his best friend, unaware of her insidious plan. In another, a casual acquaintance makes a vegan wonder if sex contradicts her beliefs. And the dispute between two strangers about feminism is resolved in bed, where a woman is not going to remain in debt to a man. The heroes of the stories tell not about sex, but about what surrounds it.",
