  "overview": "In 1994 Jan Wilborg fell backwards out of a hotel window in Copenhagen. The police quickly deemed it a suicide but throughout the years many have speculated whether or not his death was actually a murder. Wilberg's involvement with the placement of a new airport has been speculated as possible motive that the police did not thoroughly investigate. Now Discovery is looking deeper into this twenty-five-year-old cold case in a new true crime series.",
