  "overview": "At Rome's Fiumicino Airport, security personnel work around the clock to keep Italy's busiest airport free of criminal activity. Italian State Police tackle drug trafficking and illegal immigration at this gateway to Italy and the European Union. And a crack security team remain alert for signs of thieves in the airport's expansive shopping areas. Illegal drugs, fake passports and purloined perfume: it's all in a day's work at Fiumicino.",
