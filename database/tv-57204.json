  "overview": "Machine Island, an island isolated from most of the world has been torn asunder by a conflict between 3 factions vying for control. There are plentiful resources on the island enabling each faction to build a near limitless supply of robots to have at their disposal. The worldwide government has sealed the island with a Gravity Curtain where only their government-issued machinery can freely enter and leave the island. Each faction controls one portion of the curtain and the island's conflict has escalated to the point where the massive tension and destruction will eventually cause the Gravity Curtain to collapse within itself and destroy the planet . The government sends out the 2 member Death Caprice Squad: Ken Kaido and Ryo Magami - the pilots of the Mazinkaiser SKL, to neutralize the curtain and end the dispute once and for all.",
