  "overview": "The Devil Speaks uses real audio recordings to peel back the layers of a case. From police interviews to recorded phone calls and voicemails, these recordings are a launching-off point as friends and family connect us with the victim and law enforcement officers walk us through the investigation. In the end, a final piece of chilling and revealing audio is the lynchpin to helping solve the investigation.",
