  "overview": "The world's first reality show \"Waiting\" is about girls who are in pen-pal relationships with men in prison.Waiters, absentees, favourites - that's what girls who have tied their fate to prisoners and put their lives on hold call themselves. They gather in large communities where they support each other, share their worries and dream of family happiness. They are overcome by fears and doubts, afraid of deception, but hopeful that their story will be special.For the first time on television we will go to remote towns of our country to the girls who will share their incredible stories of love. Together with the viewers we will try to understand why they decided to link their lives with a man on the other side of the barbed wire. Each episode tells the story of one of the girls - how did they meet, how did the environment react to their unusual romance? In the finale, we will find out whether such relationships have a future.",
