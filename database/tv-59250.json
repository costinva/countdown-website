  "overview": "The action of the action-packed film takes place around an auto track. The story begins with the murder of the director of the racing team \"Favorite\" Fedor Golovin, who is the leader of the last competitions. This death means the death of the team - without serious financial support, its continued existence is questionable. The murder was organized by a criminal structure, which, controlling the results of car racing, controls the sweepstakes at the stadium next to the car track. Due to the circumstances, the administrator of the \"Favorite\" Konstantin Chizhov refuses to put up with the collapse and decides to do everything to revive the team and try to win the final race of the season.",
