  "overview": "Murder Loves Company examines how murder can happen anywhere – even among a close group of people. We meet a group of people in a unique world, whether it be a group of coworkers, or neighbors in a tight-knit community. Someone in this group will be murdered and someone in this group is the killer – the identity of each is a mystery and always a surprise.",
