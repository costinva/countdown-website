  "overview": "Set in a vivid, hyper-realistic land inhabited by ferocious - and often silly - dinosaurs. While the landscape and dinosaurs may be prehistoric, modern elements familiar to kids, from ice cream cones to race cars, will burst onto the scene and delight viewers. Dino Pops will deliver engaging and easy-to-digest bursts of dinosaur-related information aimed at preschool-aged children.",
