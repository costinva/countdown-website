  "overview": "Go behind the velvet rope and enter the exclusive, intensely competitive world of New York nightlife real estate, where there are millions on the line - and where those who don't take advantageâ€¦ get taken advantage of. Meet NYC's high-end listings agents as they cut deals for the hottest restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Follow along with Alex Picken and his agents - Michael, actor turned power agent; Haz, a brash young talent; Danielle, sexy senior agent; and Jason, a cocky rainmaker - as they try to stay on top of not just each other, but make a killing in the city that never sleeps.",
