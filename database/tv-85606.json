  "overview": "Yuu Yuutani, a first-year high school student with sharp eyes, large piercings, and flashy two-tone hair, is not a well-known bad girl who everyone makes way for. She is actually a very good girl at heart, and her mind is always full of thoughts of the school's Madonna, Atori Mizutori. Wanting to attract the attention of the disciplinary committee chairman Atori, Yuu decides to quit being an honor student and become a \"bad delinquent!\" A school comedy depicting the struggles of a slightly foolish self-proclaimed delinquent is about to begin!",
