  "overview": "As shark populations are declining, finding ways to share the seas is more critical than ever. In a series of jaw-dropping stories, survivors recount their harrowing encounters with massive sharks ... where some emerged miraculously unscathed and others were less fortunate. By studying the key hot spots that make up the most shark-infested waters in the world, we can learn what attracts these massive predators to frequent these areas. Video evidence can show us how these incredible hunters lean on their highly evolved skills and reveal how we can minimize our risks when entering their domain. Sharks have adapted over 400 million years to become the perfect sea predators, and our survival on land is interlinked with theirs in the sea.",
