  "overview": "This is the documentary from the adventurous expedition as far north as possible in the Arctic Ocean with the small sailing boat \"Berserk\". Against all odds, Jarle Andh√∏y, Alex Rosen, and the king of the animals - David Mercy sailed in the wake of the Viking chieftain OTTAR and furthest north to the arctic polar edge. In a mixture of Viking and robber style, the ramshackle beach-chopping is done in Norwegian history, on Shetland and Norway, but the journey comes to an abrupt end when the Berserk expedition is thrown out of its own land on Svalbard.",
