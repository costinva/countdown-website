  "overview": "Sarah is just trying to \"be audit she can be\". After finally quitting her job at a major public firm, Sarah finds herself as the Senior Accountant for SUNRYZER A.I., a fast-track to IPO tech start-up that is preparing for their annual year-end audit. While she's trying to make a good impression, her new accounting team of Hunter and Makayla isn't making it easy for her to focus on work. Meanwhile she doesn't get much support from her Manager Tracy, Controller Dave, or CFO Jessica. On top of all her normal work duties, she finds herself caught up in workplace drama thanks to top-notch auditor Lindsey and a nosey janitor. This workplace comedy sheds light onto the hilarious scenarios CPAs, staff accountants, and audit professionals find themselves in on a daily basis.",
