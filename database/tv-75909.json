  "overview": "When Gonzalo Torregrosa, owner and founder of Torregrosa Funeral Home, passes away, Dámaso Carrillo, his right-hand man in the company, doesn't hesitate that the best for the business is taking the reins himself. However, against all odds, Nieves, the septuagenarian widow, decides to take the lead in the family business, with the assistance of her inept yet enthusiastic son-in-law, Chemi, a Marketing expert, and in defiance of her daughters' plans to close the Funeral Home and start a gym. While Dámaso conspires and manipulates his colleagues against the new management, the company will face competition from Transitus Funeral Services and their expansion plans, as well as a #MeToo case that threatens Gonzalo Torregosa's legacy. ",
