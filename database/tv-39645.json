  "overview": "Sinking Cities explores how four global cities are coming to grips with the real-time effects of rising seas and extreme weather. Many of the world's most vital and historic cities were built on the coast because of their accessibility to trade via rivers and oceans. But, as the planet has warmed, geography and development have left billions of people living in the shadow of an impending disaster. Through the stories of New York, Tokyo, London and Miami, Sinking Cities presents an urgent and eye-opening examination of what may be one of the biggest threats to human survival.",
