  "overview": "Song Yijv, a senior student at the Traditional Chinese Medicine University, has long relied on the assistance of teaching assistant Xiao Jing to pass her water-related courses. The two, who have known each other for many years, have always maintained a mutually beneficial relationship. However, after a daytime meteor shower, Xiao Jing begins to act strangely, leaving Song Yijv puzzled and raising a small alarm in her mind. Indeed, the current Xiao Jing is a person from a future time and space. He has infiltrated the present reality in pursuit of a rare medicinal herb. His mission is to get close to Song Yijv's grandfather and seize the opportunity to steal the herb. Unexpectedly, due to a three-month time deviation caused by the time travel, Song Yijv's grandfather entrusts her care to Xiao Jing, creating a challenging situation for him. Determined to achieve his goal, Xiao Jing forces himself to engage in awkward social interactions. Yet, the spirited and bright Song Yijv gradually warms his heart, becoming the antidote to his inner struggles. However, the shadow of separation quietly approaches as their bond deepens.",
