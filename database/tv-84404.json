  "overview": "In this escape room comedy show, two teams – Team \"Content Creators\" and Team \"Comedians\" – compete against each other, trying to be the first to find their way out of cleverly designed adventure rooms. In each episode, a duo from each team faces off in identically themed settings, where they must prove themselves. Climbing, crawling, swimming – and using their brains – are all part of the challenge. Julien Bam and Joon Kim provide commentary from off-screen.",
