  "overview": "Hotbox is an absurdist comedy sketch television show that aired for one season in 2009. Each episode was framed with a \"hot box\" falling from space during the title sequence. As scientists perform various experiments on the box, random sketches are \"played\" on the box. These random sketches included cartoons, puppets, parody commercials, fake movie trailers and bizarre sitcoms.",
