  "overview": "This series is an authentic, raw and revealing look at Gypsy's new life on the outside. From the joyful moments as she is free to make her own decisions for the first time, to the challenges of navigating life and relationships while facing her past, including the abuse she suffered at the hands of her mother, and Gypsy's own notoriety and fame. In this delayed-coming-of-age story, Gypsy must reconcile the pop-culture, celebrity version of herself while trying to forge her brand-new identity in a \"normal\" world as wife, sister, daughter and most of all â€“ a free woman.",
