  "overview": "This 150-episode series of shorts chronicles Dorothy's long stay in the land of Oz. The Munchkins are portrayed as tiny globs; the Scarecrow is a fool named Socrates; the Tin Woodman is a bully named Rusty; and the dandy Lion is called Dandy. The Wizard, who speaks like W.C. Fields, can perform little magic beyond card tricks. Nevertheless, Dorothy continually pressures the Wizard to send her home. A constant threat is posed by the solid-green Wicked Witch of the West, who tries to make the dragonette Desmond follow her orders and attack the group of friends, even though he has no malice toward them.",
