  "overview": "Sprawling estates and magnificent castles dot Britain's landscape, passed down from one aristocratic heir or heiress to the next. But life in a stately home isn't quite the fairy tale it's made out to be. Join Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke as she ventures through some of the most storied and remarkable estates in Great Britain. From England's Newby Hall and Holdenby House to Scotland's Inveraray and Floors Castles, this is an all-access look at grand residences and the families who keep their histories alive.",
