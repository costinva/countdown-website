  "overview": "Du Kai Qi is an independent, single woman who loves comic books and her job as a chef in the fine-dining French restaurant, Figaro Cuisine. When an unassuming man, Fu Zi Jie, moves in next door, they immediately begin to bicker over trivial matters. But when Zi Jie shows up as a new employee at her restaurant, Kai Qi, as well as other staff members, mistake him for a lowly intern, not knowing that Zi Jie is a classically trained chef who just returned from France and that Figaro Cuisine is actually his father's restaurant.",
