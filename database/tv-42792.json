  "overview": "The worst homes in Houston's best neighborhoods are getting Texas-sized makeovers in the Going for Sold. The series stars real estate agent Jon Pierre Tjon-Joe-Pin and his wife Mary, a former flight attendant who left her career to pursue her love of design and start their home renovation business. In each episode, the busy parents of two turn forgotten homes into charming and affordable properties that appeal to young families looking for a high-end look without the hefty price tag. With a love for bright colors and bold design, Mary incorporates artful features into each home, including removable wallpaper, bamboo sinks, modern staircases and geometric paint accent walls.",
