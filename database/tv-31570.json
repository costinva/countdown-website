After everyone gets over the surprise, the ladies begin probing the woman's style and personality. Laverne and Co. may argue over the right course of action.

But one thing's for sure: These ladies will get the job done.Along the way, they'll be delivering a heaping helping of fashion tips and how-to information that anyone can use. At the end of each mission: a big reveal moment filled with tears, laughter and some serious OMGs. Then they hop in their fashion ambulance, and it's on to the next style crisis.",
