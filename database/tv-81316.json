  "overview": "Step back in time and remember the tastes of your childhood, as we celebrate the iconic sweets and snacks we loved - and lost - across the decades. From Texan to Tooty Frooties, Fruit Salads to Flying Saucers, Parma Violets to Pacers, Horror Bags to Hedgehog Crisps... and treats that didn't stand the test of time, like Candy Cigarettes. Unwrapping the secret stories behind our favourite sweets and snacks, we also relive rituals - from the best way to tackle a Sherbet Fountain to the dangers of a black tongue after too many Black Jacks. ",
