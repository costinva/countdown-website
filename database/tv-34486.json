  "overview": "Married to Wesley for 25 years, Bel has spent the last 18 years as a homemaker and mum to their twins, but having just waved them off to university, now has a void in her life. Enter Teddy, brother-in-law and long-time best friend, begging her to step in and rescue the family business - a down-at-heel beauty salon in Manchester's Northern Quarter.Like Bel, it could do with a bit of a face-lift. And possibly a clear-out, since it employs her high-maintenance family: mother Ivy-Rae, sisters Leanne, Tina and Heidi.Into the mix comes beautiful 20-something Personal Trainer Lorelei who seems to have caught Wes's eyeâ€¦ can Bel reconcile the demands of her business, her warring family and the problems in her marriage?",
