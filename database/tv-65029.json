In an attempt to overturn the situation, Prime Minister Washida launches project Utopi-AI, an experimental endeavor utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to select leaders to govern a demoralized city. The AI's choice for the city's leader is Maki Aran, a high school boy of 17 with dreams for a utopian society. Its choices for other governing members are also in their early 20s. With this young team, Aran utilizes AI to direct reforms and turn a dispirited city into an idealistic Utopi-AI. Original screenplay by Yoshida Reiko, writer of many hit animated features.",
