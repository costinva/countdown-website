  "overview": "Shazam! is a series of shorts airing as part of Cartoon Network's DC Nation block. The main character - Billy Batson - is gifted with the magical ability to transform into the hero Shazam by saying his name. Billy, being only a kid, uses these special powers in ridiculous ways, like calling upon the Wisdom of Solomon to figure out his math homework or the Stamina of Atlas to win a staring contest.",
