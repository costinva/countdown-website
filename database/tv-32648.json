  "overview": "Sakura Tsukuma runs a secondhand bookstore near Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Customers of various age ranges visit her secondhand bookstore. A room called \"Tamariba\" is located in her bookstore. People who do not have a place to go, gather in the room. She gives them oyakodon (food) for free. In the room, people talk about themselves, while Sakura listens to them. She sometimes encourages them with her smile and she sometimes sheds tears with them. She also faces her sad past which took place 16 years ago.",
