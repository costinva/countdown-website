  "overview": "A young generation of artists inspired by their English and German neighbors is determined to revolutionize art: Victor Hugo, George Sand, Honoré de Balzac, Alexandre Dumas, Eugène Delacroix, Gérard de Nerval, Charles Baudelaire ... While the people in the streets rumble and clamor for the Republic, the Romantics will not rest until freedom is in power. Their works and ideas will fundamentally transform French society.",
