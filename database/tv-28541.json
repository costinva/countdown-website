  "overview": "Every week under the small screen Big Top, the golden-throated, acid-tongued Ring Master is joined by Tripod, the Umbilical Brothers, Claire Hooper, Flacco, &amp; the hot house band sounds of the Bearded Ladies. Plus the best in stand-up, rock 'n' roll, cabaret, burlesque, freakshow &amp; death-defying variety, often involving sharp objects &amp; fire, sometimes invisible animals &amp; stainless steel underwear. Occasionally all in the same act.\t\t",
