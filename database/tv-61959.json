The two women reside in an old family friend, named Modesta and her son Sergio. Modesta is a cook for the rich and influential family Mendoza. Lucecita dreams of the day when she'll return to the country. Unfortunately Rosa's health worsens and a secret she kept all her life makes her to ask Modesta for help. Modesta manages to convince her employer, Miguel de Mendoza, who happens to be Rosa's only love to visit the sick woman for the last time. When Miguel sees Rosa after so many years she unravels that he is Lucecita's father and gets him to vow to look after his illegitimate daughter. After Rosa's death, haunted by the promise he gave, Miguel decides to let Lucecita live in his mansion but as a maid clueless to her origin. Grateful to the kind gentleman from her mother's past, Lucecita does everything to get the approval of Miguel's despotic wife, Graciela and his invalid daughter, Angelina. By that time Lucecita starts to bond with Angelina's handsome but unhappy husband, Gustavo. He is well known for his noble and charitable personality and that is enough to win Lucecita's heart forever.",
