When a mummified body is found in the Spreewaldmoor, he is asked to reconstruct its face. The dead man is a friend from high school - who was said to have towed to the west and therefore betrayed his friends to state security - including Til. Now it turns out - the friend was already dead at the time of the betrayal. Til's personal story and the story of his friends at the time must be rewritten. Til goes on the trip - back to the Spreewald. To the places of his youth and his secrets. In search of its past, its identity, its history.",
