  "overview": "Following a hilariously humiliating mishap at her high school grad, Violet wants to make the most of the last summer before moving away for university, as Harley distracts herself from a big dilemma of what's next. As the lifelong friends bask in newfound freedom, and face adult life choices, cracks begin to form in their once impenetrable bond. It's awkward. It's dramatic. It's friggin' Winnipeg.",
