  "overview": "For nearly 50 years, Dr. Goodall has had a vision to create a better world for all. Integral to this vision is the idea that every individual has a role to play and is important â€“ both human and nonhuman animals alike. That is why Jane founded Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center in the Republic of the Congo nearly 30 years ago. For decades, the sanctuary has served as a safe haven for second chances and works to end the drivers of illegal trade which steals thousands of individual great apes from the wild. Now, the stories of the incredible rescued chimpanzees of Tchimpounga and their caregivers will finally be told.",
