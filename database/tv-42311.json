  "overview": "Por H o por B follows Hache and Belén, who are reunited after a few years of not speaking to each other and find themselves living in the hipster Madrid neighborhood of Malasaña – a far cry from their roots on the outskirts of the city. The culture clash leads to a cataclysm of ridiculous and awkward consequences as they navigate their friendship, and the fake new world they're now a part of.",
