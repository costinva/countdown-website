  "overview": "On April 19, 1970, the first five \"Zhiguli\" came off the assembly line of AVTOVAZ. Over the next 18 years, the plant will produce almost 5 million \"kopecks\", but the first five were special: after all, the plant mechanic hid several kilograms of gold in the gas tank of one of these cars. Only fifty years later, a group of adventurers learns the story of the treasure and is inspired by the treasure hunt. They get to the very first \"Zhiguli\" exhibited in the museum, but they find nothing. Instead, they find out that the other four cars still exist, and set off in pursuit of gold, unaware that they are actually looking for themselves and their way of life.",
