  "overview": "The Core is a dissection of the brilliant minds from which genre films spring. Whether it's a demo on head explosions, or a primer on avoiding predictable jump scares, The Core busts open the traditional talk show and plays with its guts. Host Mickey Keating and his guests examine the onscreen techniques and real-life psychologies that strike fear into our very core. We'll turn you on to what's thrilling in filmmaking today, without subjecting you to a chat with that dude Greg from film school.",
