  "overview": "The series sees home renovation experts Keith Bynum and Evan Thomas fulfilling their dream of restoring Motor City's iconic American neighborhoods, one house at a time. With help from their friend, lifetime Detroit resident and real estate expert Shea Hicks-Whitfield, the couple buys as many rundown and abandoned houses as they can on a single block and then renovates them to make them appealing, yet affordable enough for buyers within the community.",
