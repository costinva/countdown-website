  "overview": "Melissa Etheridge: I'm Not Broken tells an inspiring story of healing and transcendence through the power of music when five female residents from the Topeka Correctional Facility, a women's prison in Kansas, write letters to Etheridge that she then uses as inspiration to create and perform an original song for them. Having recently lost her son to opioids, Etheridge works to understand and interrupt the cycle of addiction while connecting with these women who, so often, are forgotten by society.",
