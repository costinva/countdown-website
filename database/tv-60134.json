  "overview": "On January 31, 2012, the eccentric lord of the castle Stijn Saelens is killed with a shot in the back in the hall of his castle. The same day, his father-in-law Dr Gyselbrecht is arrested. Gyselbrecht and Saelens have been at odds for some time now. Stijn Saelens has concrete plans to move with his family to a commune in Australia and there are rumors that Stijn Saelens is abusing his eldest daughter. The doctor has a clear motive but firmly denies having anything to do with the murder of his son-in-law.",
