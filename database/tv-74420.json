  "overview": "Junior corporate worker Yang Xiaozhu unexpectedly became the executive assistant to Zhu Xiaoyang, the president of a color light manufacturing company, who has to be at work every morning at six o'clock. After being sternly dismissed by Zhu Xiaoyang due to a work mistake, Yang Xiaozhu found a cute little pig in the restroom. The next day, waking up, the pig that had been sleeping beside her turned out to be the naked president! It turned out that every day after sunset, Zhu Xiaoyang would transform into a cute little pig, and only a true love's kiss could break the spell. Kind-hearted Yang Xiaozhu, in a daze, accepted the commission from Zhu's mother and started to attempt a romantic relationship with Zhu Xiaoyang, embarking on a cohabitation life. The two faced the vicious competition in the business market together, and their feelings grew warmer. However, the appearance of Zhu Xiaoyang's college-era unrequited love, Bai Yueguang, confused Yang Xiaozhu's mind. Coincidentally, several attempts of kisses between Zhu and Yang did not seem to work. Could it be that Zhu Xiaoyang's true love was not her after all?",
