  "overview": "In this fresh take on the classic fish-out-of-water story, moms and dads try out the ultimate life change: ditching their families to take over a clan from another walk of life. For some, it's a dream vacation; for others, an absolute nightmare. When the families are switched, they live with their host families for one whole week. When the mom or dads are finally reunited with their loved ones, they have to tell their families the twist: They decide how the other family will spend their $50,000 prize money.",
