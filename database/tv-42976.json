  "overview": "Discussing our personal finances are one of the last great taboos, but while employment is at a record high in Britain, more and more working households are privately struggling to make ends meet.In this series, families from across the UK reveal what it really means to be in work, but still only ‘just about managing'.With the cost of living rising and one third of British workers surveyed in 2018 having less than £500 in savings, Broke follows nine families during a critical year as their financial future hangs in the balance.",
