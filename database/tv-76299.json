  "overview": "A French Dachshund called ZeFronk hosts a healthy cooking show from his doghouse with his assistant, a songbird named Sue, and his silly neighbour cat named Dom that always sneaks away the snacks that ZeFronk makes, and each episode ends with ZeFronk chasing Dom around the prep counter, triggering Sue to fly away and come through the iris wipe.",
