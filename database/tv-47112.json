  "overview": "Two years have passed since Juan Carrasco, former Minister of Agriculture, reached the heights of power. He now finds himself far from the world of politics leading a simple life as a high school biology teacher in Logro√±o. Nonetheless, neither his political ambition nor his vocation for public service have abated. Aware of how much he still has to contribute, he decides to take a step forward: he gets his trusted team back together and they return to Madrid to found a new party. To achieve this, Carrasco will have to do everything he can to get political funding and to face down the established powers.",
