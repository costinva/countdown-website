  "overview": "In the frontier town of Nome, Alaska, there's a gold rush on. But you've never seen gold mining like this before -- here, the precious metal isn't found in the ground. It's sitting in the most unlikely of places: the bottom of the frigid, unpredictable Bering Sea. And there are a handful of people willing to risk it all to bring it to the surface in Bering Sea Gold.",
