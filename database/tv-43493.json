  "overview": "Everyone is hiding something. It may be a harmless secret, or it might be something far more serious, like a terrible betrayal of trust or shocking indiscretion. In some cases these lies can stay hidden, in other cases they are revealed with time. But then there are times when an event is so cataclysmic that everyone's truths are laid bare. In The Lies That Bind, episodes tell the story of murder investigations that gradually exposed one truth after another, revealing the sinister conflicts that simmer beneath seemingly placid and bucolic communities.",
