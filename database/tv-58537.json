  "overview": "John Hawkins is an assistant district attorney from New York who's being considered as the next candidate for district attorney. Then the district attorney in Seattle calls to tell him that his 16-year-old son Dylan is in trouble and he is tired of letting his wealthy grandparents bail him out; he strongly suggests that John take responsibility for his own son. John has had little contact with Dylan for 7 years, having been an alcoholic who felt that Dylan would be better off with his grandparents while his dad fixes himself. John agrees to take Dylan, and decides to take him on a long motorcycle trip on his old machine so they can reestablish a relationship. Along the way they run into all sorts of people whose lives they get involved in before moving on.",
