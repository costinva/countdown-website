  "overview": "Barbarita is a sweet and modest young woman who works as a seamstress at a renowned fashion boutique in Miami. When she is asked to do a fitting for the well-known society widow Ricarda Thomson, Barbarita has no clue that this will be the beginning of a tortuous relationship between her and this millionaire family. At the estate, she fortuitously meets Valentino, Ricarda's oldest son. Single, dishonest, spoiled and accustomed to always getting his way, Valentino decides to seduce the beautiful Barbarita, who soon succumbs to his charms. However, for the first time in his life, Valentino feels more than physical attraction and discovers that he has fallen in love for real.",
