  "overview": "Mafias and Banks: two opposite worlds. They share the same taste for luxury, risk, and easy money yet they despise and fear each other and both have connections to the government.For a long time, criminals robbed banks, ripping them open and emptying their safes. It wasn't until the end of the Second World War that the mafias realized just how much profit they could make from banking institutions, and later from finance.",
