  "overview": "MacGruder and Loud were uniformed police officers who shared a police car by day and a passionate love by night. They had secretly married despite department regulations and now had to hide that fact to stay on the force. There were plenty of high-speed chases, shootouts and other dangerous assignments. The police brass never seemed to catch on to their little secret, though.",
