  "overview": "NFL Thursday Night Football is the branding used for broadcasts of National Football League (NFL) games that broadcast primarily on Thursday nights, and occasionally on Saturdays in the later portion of the season. Most of the games kick off at 8:25 p.m. Eastern Time. Debuting on November 23, 2006, the telecasts were originally part of NFL Network's Run to the Playoffs package, which consisted of eight total games broadcast on Thursday and Saturday nights (five on Thursdays, and three on Saturdays, originally branded as Saturday Night Football) during the latter portion of the season. Since 2012, the TNF package has begun during the second week of the NFL season. Beginning in 2014 the CBS Network began airing NFL Football on Thursday nights and in 2015 the CBS Network and the NFL Network split-up taking turns airing Thursday night games with CBS beginning the season and the NFL Network doing the last half of season games.",
