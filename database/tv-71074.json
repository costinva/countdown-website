  "overview": "Where's Wanda? tells the story of Dedo and Carlotta Klatt, who are desperate to locate their missing 17-year-old daughter Wanda, who disappeared months ago without a trace. When the police fail to find her, the family takes matters into their own hands, obtaining surveillance devices with the help of their tech-savvy son Ole. Disguising themselves as employees of an electrical company, they bug first their neighborhood and then half their suburb, finding out that behind closed doors none of their neighbors are who they pretend to be.",
