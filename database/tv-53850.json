  "overview": "Historian Dan Snow puts his walking boots on and sets off to see what the great British landscape can teach us about our Norman predecessors. Shown earlier this year on BBC4, anyone with a passing interest in British history (or landscape for that matter) will be gripped by this entertaining and educational series. Dan Snow separates myth from fact as he explores the legacy of the 11th-century Norman invasion of the British isles.",
