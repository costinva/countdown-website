  "overview": "Through the psychological counselor Lu Yue and with a sharp perspective, the story will lead the audience to explore the human nature of the visitors and reveal the secrets deep inside their hearts. When we are back to square one, we will find the \"original sins\" behind those inconceivable behaviors, accept who we truly are and talk, grow up and be loved again. The psychological counseling office is like the archives of people's inner conflicts, secrets and past. Lu Yue carefully reads the minds and soothes the tired souls of all the visitors, including the successful A Jie who wants to find true love, the sister and brother who have been estranged for years due to what happened in their youth, the new wife who is in trouble with her mother-in-law and the entrepreneur who wants to make amends to friends.",
