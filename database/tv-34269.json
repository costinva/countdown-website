Kabir Sawant, a brilliant but unconventional officer of the Mumbai Crime Branch, puts the pieces together of seemingly unconnected deaths that lead to an unlikely suspect - the affable Danny Mascarenhas. As Danny faces the difficult choice between morality and the slim possibility of saving his dying son's life, Kabir will not stop till he cracks the case and delivers justice.",
