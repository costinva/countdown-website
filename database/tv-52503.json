  "overview": "Ptolemy Grey is a 91-year-old man forgotten by his family, by his friends, by even himself. On the brink of sinking even deeper into a lonely dementia, Ptolemy experiences a seismic shift when he's given the tremendous opportunity to briefly regain his memories, and uses this precious and fleeting lucidity to solve his nephew's death and come to terms with his past.",
