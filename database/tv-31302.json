  "overview": "Land of the Eagle is the first television series to attempt a comprehensive account of North America's wildlife and wild places. Land of the Eagle turns the clock back to reveal the continent as it used to be, hundreds of years ago, a story told by the people who lived on it, charted it and shaped it - the Native Americans and the European explorers and settlers. This eight-part series explores the great diversity of the continent, revealing the bonds between human history and natural history as it travels from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Along the way, it traverses the rugged Canadian wilderness, the swampy Everglades, the sweeping Great Plains, the majestic Rockies, the arid, hostile deserts, and Alaska - the last wild frontier of America. Together, the eight programmes reveal the way that the nature of this 'untamed' land shaped the lives and fortunes of those who ventured into its vast interior. Through their writings and diaries, Peter Crawford's award-winning series recreates the landscapes and wildlife of North America at the time when the first Europeans came to this 'new world'.",
