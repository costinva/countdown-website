  "overview": "Martha Haslbeck is a woman in her early 50s, has a 23-year-old daughter and is divorcing her husband Josef after 28 years of marriage. As a janitor she wears smock aprons and likes to wear blue when she goes out. She has the typical perm, and a beer doesn't leave her cold either. Martha Haslbeck has never left her Munich neighborhood of Haidhausen. But she is a heroine in her apartment building. She simply copes with everything. Whether it's a clogged toilet, an escaped cat or her flatmates' tarnished married life - Martha has a solution for everything.",
