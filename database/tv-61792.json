  "overview": "Spiky Gold Hunters follows six courageous, rough, tough, and charismatic characters as they battle the tempestuous elements of Southern New Zealand to deliver the gastronomic equivalent of diamonds to fine diners around the globe – sea urchin! This six part one hour series is not for the faint-hearted – and nor is the environment these divers work in. Foveaux Strait is prone to vicious storms, big swells and ever changing weather conditions and on top of that, the divers have to overcome freezing temperatures and the inherent threat of shark attacks. ",
