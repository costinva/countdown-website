  "overview": "Bama Belles follows a group of down-home Alabama women as they juggle their careers, home lives and relationships with one another. These women, who reside in rural Dothan, Alabama, deal with everything from packed work schedules, to packing a lunch. They get down and dirty in the south hunting, fishing, four wheeling and tailgating at stock car races. These larger than life Southerners show everyone how real women do it on the other side of the Mason Dixon line.",
