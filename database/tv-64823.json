  "overview": "In 1979, in Caguas, Puerto Rico, at the initiative of an ambitious and skilled businessman named Edgardo Díaz, a group was born that laid the foundations for the \"boy bands\" that still exist today. Creating never-before-seen rules and a work style that had never been implemented before, he developed a group that continues to be the benchmark for all other Hispanic youth bands.",
