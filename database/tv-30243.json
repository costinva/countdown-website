  "overview": "Set off the Coast of Alabama, Reef Wranglers follows a family of experienced divers and demolition experts who work to reduce erosion and pollution and to restore the area's once thriving ecosystem by creating artificial reefs - sinking everything from a Vietnam-era plane to a local shrimp boat. The Gulf of Mexico is a breeding ground for bad weather and conditions that change suddenly. Often battling hurricane-force winds, these men and women risk life and limb to sink custom reef systems to enhance the Gulf of Mexico's ecosystem.",
