  "overview": "In The Island, four comics compete to make their own personal dream desert island the best one.Â Each week, Tom Allen will put these four islands, and their leaders to the test - who's got the best house band? How do you even judge that? And you may think you want your island's only drink to be Fanta Limon, but what happens when it attracts that swarm of angry bees you chose last week?Kemah Bob and Jason Forbes will be on hand as they bring 'live' reports from the islands, to make sure nothing is missed.",
