  "overview": "Vedat, a veteran missionary, and Evren, a political corrector who has studied philosophy, are the duo assigned for the 'extremely important' errands of a wealthy businessman. This mismatched duo, one of whom closes his eyes and does his duty, and the other questions every step he takes, sets out on a different adventure in each episode. But they clash within themselves, more than they do due to duty.",
