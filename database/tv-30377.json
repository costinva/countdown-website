  "overview": "Hosted by Jeff Douglas, Ancestors in the Attic is an irreverent, fast-paced series that uncovers the personal dramas in your family tree. From the discovery of a birth mother in Scotland, to a lost family in Japan, to a woman's roots in the Masa tribe of northern Cameroon, Ancestors in the Attic changes the lives of Canadians. Our crack team of genealogical sleuths employ a mixture of CSI genealogy and good old-fashioned gumshoe detective work to solve the mysteries, and unlock the secrets of your past. Join us on a road trip across the country, and around the world, as we reveal the inside tricks of the genealogy trade, and take you on a uniquely personal journey through some of the most fascinating events in Canadian history.",
