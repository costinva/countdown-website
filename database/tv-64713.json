In each episode, the contestants will have to pass different dance, sewing or acting challenges to avoid being eliminated and thus be crowned the winner and earn their place in the Drag Race España Hall of Fame. To judge their work, in addition to Supremme herself, Ana Locking, Javier Calvo and Javier Ambrossi continue on the show.",
