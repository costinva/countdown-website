  "overview": "Zak Bagans, Aaron Goodwin, Jay Wasley and Billy Tolley gather in their screening room and get candid about their most iconic investigations, including Branson's Titanic Museum, Goatman's Bridge in Texas, the unforgettable Island of the Dolls and more. Away from the haunted locations we usually see them in, with no equipment or investigations, it's just the team, some munchies and never-before-heard stories from the moments that created a legacy.",
