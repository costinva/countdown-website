  "overview": "Evo would rather be far away and forget what happened to him. It hurts but he needs to forget and atleast breathe. He wants to have peace of mind so that he can help himself from disappointment. But he left a promise that when he returns he will open his heart for Joshua whom he has loved for a long time. But what if when he left he met someone he didn't think would give him a strange smile and bring him happiness?",
