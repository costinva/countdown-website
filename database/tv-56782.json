  "overview": "Vampires are said to have many weaknesses such as garlic, crosses, and sunlight. Game-loving vampire lord Draluc just so happens to be weak to... everything. He dies, turning into a pile of ash, at the slightest shock. When his castle is destroyed, he teams up with Vampire Hunter Ronaldo, much to the other's chagrin. Despite their differences, they must try to work together to defend themselves from rogue vampires, Ronaldo's murderous editor, investigators, and moreâ€”with Draluc dying continuously along the way.",
