  "overview": "Family Reboot features, in each episode, one family with a modern day relatable issue that's driving a wedge between them. Issues range from workaholic parents, overly competitive siblings, technology addiction or a family secret that has recently been revealed. All of these families have reached a breaking point, and it's time for them to disconnect from their busy lives, devices, and outside influences in order to address their issues head-on. With the help of a specialized expert, each family will go on a unique journey that organically ties to the issues they are facing in order to confront the family's dilemma head-on. Can they finally come together as a family to overcome their obstacles â€¦ and reconnect?",
