  "overview": "Mia, a former catwalk model is on the run, mainly from herself. Long term it's a story of personal renewal but for now, the stark reality is that her career is over, she's flat broke and she's homeless. This is a woman who despite her humble beginnings has become accustomed, possibly even addicted, to the finer things in life. Unfortunately, those lifestyle choices don't carry much currency when you're pushing 40 and permanently sofa surfing. She may have a high falutin' attitude and a world class skincare regime but Mia's now living on the breadline.",
