  "overview": "Advent Calendar. Do you remember Jens Petrus? Shoemaker playing tuba? Even though he is busy now before Christmas, he always has time to help, and always a smile on the nap. Especially when baker Snipp comes by with something good. In the small town you meet many cozy people. Florist Rosengren, Chief of Police Klinke, Mrs Enebær and many more. So we say as Tøfflus; Spin movies! Advent Calendar.",
