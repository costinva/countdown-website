  "overview": "The Beverley Allitt Tapes looks at how in 1993, a shy, unassuming young nurse went on to receive 13 life sentences for the murder, attempted murder and grievous bodily harm of a 13 children which took place during the space of 59 days whilst working on a ward at Grantham and Kesthevan Hospital, Lincolnshire in 1991, making her one of Britain's most notorious female killers. The gritty series re-examines her crimes and the impact they had on all those effected. From the investigators who brought her to justice, to the parent whose child had a very lucky escape encounter with Allitt, to the medical professionals seeking legitimate explanations for the inexplicable deaths, through to the impact on the families of the victims, as well as the survivors physically and mentally scarred  by their experiences. ",
