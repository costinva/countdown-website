  "overview": "Adults Adopting Adults explores the unique stories of grown adults who are pursuing the unusual route to the American family: adult adoption. Six different pairs with individual motivations will embark on a journey to add an adult family member to their households. But new families come with new problems; before they finalize their adoption, they will face scrutiny from their peers, naysayers questioning motives, and biological family members trying to stop the adoption. Will it be happily ever after for these new families or will their constructed clans crumble?",
