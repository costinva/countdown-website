  "overview": "In this show, Mareike, a dentistry student from Kiel, was introduced to \"Gunnar Janßen\". Her task during the show was to convince her parents that she wanted to marry him. From her point of view, \"Gunnar\" had the same task towards his own parents. If they succeeded, they would receive a large sum of money.In reality, however, \"Gunnar\" was the actor Tetje Mierendorf, who had been hired by Sat.1 to make Mareike's task as difficult as possible. To do so, he ignored many taboos, such as a complete lack of table manners, rudeness and clumsiness. His family and friends were also impersonated by actors, all of whom deliberately displayed behavior that was shocking to Mareike and her family.Following the show, Mareike received a fee of 500,000 euros. \"Gunnar\" only explained to her and her family one minute before the arranged marriage that everything had been staged and that he did not normally behave like this. The entire show was accompanied and commented on by presenter Jessica Witte-Winter.",
