  "overview": "Andrey, Kostya, Yura, Danya and Vitalik were best friends in the dashing 90s. The nickname Fingers quickly became attached to the teenagers, and the guys themselves were inspired by gangster romance. The lawlessness that reigned on the streets of the provincial Shubinskaya pushed them against local racketeers. The showdown resulted in death and criminal cases, and the gun was hidden in a hiding place. Only the Fingers knew about it, each of which went its own way. But 20 years later, the past catches up with the guys, and the trust between them collapses.",
