  "overview": "Zhan Peng's father was a railway policeman who was posthumously honored as a martyr for his sacrifice many years ago. Influenced by that, Zhan Peng had always aspired to follow in his father's footsteps and serve in the very same station where his father once worked. However, when he finally arrived in Xiaotong and began his duties, he discovered that the situation there was far more complex than he had imagined. Upon first meeting Tu Hongjiang, he did not trust this veteran police officer. Tu Hongjiang's suspicious behaviors during the handling of a drug trafficking case even made Zhan Peng wary of him. However, as time passed, Tu Hongjiang proved his innocence through his actions. As they worked together on cases, Zhan Peng gradually developed respect for Tu Hongjiang, and the two eventually joined forces to apprehend the mastermind behind the crimes",
