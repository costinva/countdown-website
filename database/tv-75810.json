  "overview": "Twelve mysterious letters, thirty-five years of unending anticipation. This drama focuses on the fate and romance of a small-town youth wrapped in a fantasy shell with suspense as bait and emotions at its core. It breaks traditional narrative patterns by introducing a unique dual-time-space interaction mechanism. The unpredictable weather and the blackboard in an abandoned classroom open a channel connecting two-time spaces, creating an enthralling and suspenseful experience.",
