  "overview": "There have been three attempts to kill Lew Burnett. After the third attempt Lew decides to stay 'dead' - so that he can stay alive. Lew Burnett, owner of an international construction company, begins scouring his past to find out who hated, loved or envied him enough to want him out of the way for good; he is not running from his enemies but trying to draw them out. In this state of transition - symbolised by the Hanged Man of the Tarot - he can no longer fall back on his money or influence, just the wits and hands with which he built up his own small empire. In the process, he is forced to confront some painful truths. Made by Yorkshire Television for the ITV Network.",
