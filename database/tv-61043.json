  "overview": "Fashion designer Lansky, in search of former glory and money for a new collection, finds a sponsor in the person of the wife of a criminal boss Gali. A self-confident girl arrives in Moscow with her \"faithful dog\" Misha to cover up her husband's machinations with the Lansky brand. Dreaming of shows in Paris, the fashion designer is forced to work with an obscenely rich Sakhalin girl, devoid of taste. However, over time, Lansky will see a long-awaited muse in the gruff Gala.",
