  "overview": "The ninth princess of the Southern Kingdom, Hongdou, grew up smart and mature, read the art of war and strategy, and hid her talent to avoid the front line. Later, she came to the throne by thunderous means and crowned herself the Empress. On the night of her ascension to the throne, Hongdou travelled to modern times and met the star Ye Xing. Ye Xing and Hong Dou, a pair of happy couple, tried all kinds of ways to help Hong Dou to cross back to the southern country. When Hongdou returned to the southern country began to vigorously reorganise the country, but did not know that Ye Xing also followed the crossing to the southern country, and became Hongdou's \"male favourite\". Thus, the happy couple began to play the court version of the battle of wits.",
