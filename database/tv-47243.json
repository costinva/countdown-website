  "overview": "Uprooted from her home life in rural Ruakowhai, Beth Connolly is forced to move to a strange new suburb when her parents separate. Starting in a new town, in a new school, is a daunting process - especially when the place is filled with freaks who keep inexplicably staring at her. Scared and lonely, she needs the support of her mates to help her figure out what's going on.What set Reservoir Hill apart was the level to which audience members could interact with the story. Viewers played the role of Beth's friends. They were able to drive the story forward with the ability to SMS text advice to Beth when she gets into a sticky situation. At the end of each episode, viewers then had the opportunity to text Beth via their cell phones or the website itself and then (thanks to some very clever technology) actually watch her receive their personal message – in the actual movie – seconds later within a bonus scene.",
