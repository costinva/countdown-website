  "overview": "Morally ambiguous, the Spiritual Heaven Sect is an influential sect that has remained in seclusion for years. Its Young Lady, Ling Xuan, encountered a pair of dying siblings during her travels ten years ago. In exchange for saving the younger sister's life, she proposed a ten-year pact with the young man. She brought him into the Shadow Pavilion of the Spiritual Heaven Sect for training. If he could survive and graduate ten years later, he would become her assistant. The young man fought desperately and finally left the Shadow Pavilion alive with a new name, Ying Shi. However, the Spiritual Heaven Sect has fallen into a vulnerable state.",
