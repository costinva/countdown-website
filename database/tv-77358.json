  "overview": "Nora is a successful businesswoman with a steely grip not only in work, but also in family relationships. The ideally built system of her life collapses when her beloved husband Vanya suddenly dies. The news of death is accompanied by no less shocking information: Vanya had a \"second life.\" He not only cheated on his wife, but also secretly practiced tango - a passionate dance that is the complete opposite of a clear and structured life with Nora. Trying to understand what happened, Nora herself goes to a tango school, which at first seems to her to be a meeting place for people with low social responsibility. But in the end, it is this colorful world that changes Nora beyond recognition: she will go from a woman with an iron grip to a free and soft dancer.",
