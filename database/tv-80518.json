Secrets linger and danger is never too far away. As bodies start piling up around the once-safe place, Mallory and her team are thrust into a series of intriguing cases that bring into focus the tragedies that have beset her family. Plagued by the suspicion that her ex-fiance might somehow be involved in their deaths, Mallory also realises that her mother may know more than she is willing to reveal. ",
