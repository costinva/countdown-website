  "overview": "Set over the course of a major drug cartel bust, No Activity follows the misadventures of two low-ranking cops who spend way too much time together; two criminals who are kept in the dark; two dispatch workers who haven't really clicked; and two Mexican tunnelers who get stuck in a space unsuitable for a pair of relative strangers.",
