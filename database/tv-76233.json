  "overview": "Haro is a refined and Machiavellian aristocrat who is serving a sentence for rape and murder, and who is threatened with death by a kidnapper who acts against the business elite. Taking advantage of that connection, Haro negotiates prison benefits in exchange for collaborating in the investigation of the kidnappings, although in reality he is preparing his revenge against the judge who imprisoned him.",
