  "overview": "Click is shot in a screenlife format and shows the story of a specific online relationship between a student Yasha, a blogger Lisa and an adult IT specialist Arthur, accompanied by his eternally dissatisfied wife Sveta. The introduction of the main characters, shown in the first series, begins with mutual insults and ridicule, but very soon the three realize how much they really need each other. In each of the series, they will have to solve the \"questions of life and death\" of one of the team members: open a package from the darknet, pass a test, hide from his wife and pass other life quests. And often, solving one problem, friends will create new ones. Click was born as a result of the first web series accelerator conducted by TV-3 and 1-2-3 Production in 2019. The author of the idea of the series was creative producer Andrey Smiyan, screenwriters-Maxim Kozhaev and Alexander Bazaleev!",
