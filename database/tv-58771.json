  "overview": "The project is based on five Aleksandr Pushkin's fairy tales, one of which will be adapted into two episodes. Classical texts will retain their idea, but will be filled with completely new, relevant and sometimes unexpected meaning. In each series, the action of the tales of the great writer is transferred to our reality. The familiar Pushkin images will become even clearer: Tsarevna will be an instablogger, Elisey will be a rapper, and the Golden Cockerel will be a neural network.",
