  "overview": "Magnus is about police detective Magnus Undredal, who solves criminal cases in his own unique, creative way. The series is told from the perspective of a lonely man who doesn't quite fit in, yet who over the course of the series may just prove that his methods are the only right ones to solve this crime. Because a young woman has been mysteriously murdered and popular actor Robert Danielsen has disappeared without a trace. It quickly becomes evident that cosmic forces are at work. Magnus investigates by elaborately reasoning his way to logical conclusions and using his special skills – such as turning himself into a chest of drawers, or hiding inside an armchair – to eventually find the right answers.",
