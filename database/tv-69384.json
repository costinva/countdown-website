  "overview": "Evacuation tells the untold, inside story of the British military campaign to evacuate Kabul airport in 2021, through raw, intimate, never-heard-before testimony from the British servicemen and women who found themselves at the epicentre of an unfolding crisis as the Taliban closed in.This series goes beyond the headlines and parliamentary debates of the time, focusing instead on the personal stories of the British servicemen and women who found themselves dealing with a humanitarian crisis on a scale they'd never experienced before. Some 15,000 British nationals and eligible Afghans were flown out in a matter of days, but the human dilemmas on the ground for the armed forces sent to extract them play out like drama in this gripping series.",
