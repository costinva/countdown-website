  "overview": "Dafne's life is a mess. Just when she thought it couldn't get any worse after her boyfriend left her and she got fired from a job she didn't even like...she realizes she's completely in love with her best friend, and roommate, CÃ©sar. Her friends, a bunch of thirty-somethings lives are not much better. All of them are frustrated in love and sex, working in lousy jobs, trying to find themselves, and some love, in Madrid.",
