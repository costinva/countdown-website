  "overview": "This series transports viewers behind the scenes at the UK's most remote hospita - the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick, Shetland.Here, doctors and nurses work alongside GPs, paramedics, coastguard, lifeboat crews and police to provide emergency and medical care to the islands' 23,000 residents, as well as workers from the surrounding oil and gas rigs and cruise tourists. Surrounded by the North Sea and closer to the Arctic Circle than London, Shetland throws up unique challenges for this tight-knit team.",
