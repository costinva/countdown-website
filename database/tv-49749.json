  "overview": "Set in Manchester, Life follows the stories of the residents of a large house divided into four flats. As each of the four stories unfold and intertwine in surprising ways, they tell a larger story about what happens when we step out of our personal space and take a closer look into other people's lives. Life explores love, loss, birth, death, the ordinary, the extraordinary and everything in between.",
