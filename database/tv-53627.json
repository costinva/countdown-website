  "overview": "Four childhood friends, Sam, Bilal, Romane and Victor, are leading a calm existence in a peaceful village in the mountains when a mysterious event turns their worlds upside down. In a split second, the universe discards its rules and reshuffles everything: the present, the future and multiverses merge, separating the teens and sending them into parallel worlds, in different time frames. They set about trying to fathom out what happened and strive to find each other and turn the clocks back, to return to the world \"they used to live in\". Facing their potential destinies will be the opportunity to grow up and to see things a new way, as their parents will or as Lieutenant Retz will, having to deal for the first time with an investigation challenging his scientific mind.",
