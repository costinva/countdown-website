  "overview": "Knowing the hardship of being an orphan, Jung Da So endures the stigma of being an unwed mother in raising the child of a deceased friend as her own so that the child will never suffer from being an orphan. Ha Tae Woong, who was raised by his uncle after his mother died, has never met his father. Through a twist of fate, Da So meets Tae Woong, Kang Sae Hyun and Ho Ji Soo, and sees both the best and worst in human nature.",
