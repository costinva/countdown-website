  "overview": "Innovative musical dramedy about a whip-smart but socially awkward girl in her late 20's who is suddenly able to hear the innermost thoughts of people around her as songs and even big musical numbers that they perform just for her. With this new ability at her disposal, she is able to use her â€˜gift' to not only help herself understand people in her life, but also to help others around her.",
