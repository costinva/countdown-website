  "overview": "The series \"Blondes\" will tell about the work of a secret special department for solving especially complex crimes in St. Petersburg. The agents have an extremely unusual cover - their office exists under the guise of the \"Blondes\" marriage agency. The department is supervised by an experienced investigator Smolov, who has gathered three completely different girls under his wing. This is a former employee of the Investigative Committee - rational Kiseleva, a bright and daring lover of horoscopes and men Gorskaya and uncompromising Boyko, a master of martial arts. Together they will have to not only catch offenders, but also learn to work in a team.",
