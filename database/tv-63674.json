  "overview": "Markus Haglund is a controversial criminal law professor who works for those who have been unfairly treated or innocent, he is passionate about helping victims of injustice. Assisting Haglund are four talented and carefully selected law students Fia Jönsson, Anna Sjöstedt, Belal Al-Mukhtar and Roger Andersson. At Uppsala University he holds, reluctantly, a course called unjustly sentenced (oskyldigt dömd in Swedish). He often takes the more unorthodox and risky practices, the best way to prove someone's innocence is to find the real perpetrator. He fights in the courts, in prisons, in television and sofas in too many bars. Markus and his students shares a passion for solving mysteries and finding the truth which is not always easy. Can you break the law to uphold it?",
