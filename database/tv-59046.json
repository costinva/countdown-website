  "overview": "Three prominent Australians - NSW Greens MP Jenny Leong, journalist Caleb Bond and author and TV personality Julie Goodwin - will go on separate immersive journeys into three distinct Australian localities and communities, to gain insights into the world of poverty and disadvantage in Australia, and to see whether they themselves could survive on welfare and low-incomes. For all three, the experience will be confronting and at times emotional - but how will it change them?",
