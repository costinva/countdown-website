Along with the guidance of Dr. Charles Procter Jr., these cousins lean on one another to overcome lifelong anxieties and inspire a true lifestyle change.The six one-hour episodes begin with Beverly, Naomi's mother, who undergoes weight loss surgery in a last attempt to turn things around and hopefully inspire her daughter, niece and nephew to follow in her footsteps. In helping her mother recover from her weight loss surgery, Naomi sees firsthand the frightening complications involved in recovery, but is motivated by her dream to start a family. Meanwhile, cousin Drew must overcome his denial of how addictive his eating habits have become before he even begins to consider moving forward with surgery. Finally, cousin Chitoka as been bed-bound for over three years due to her morbid obesity and must literally take her first steps in the right direction in order to qualify for surgery.While these cousins can rely on the support of family, it is up to each of them to take control of their own lives to change their deadly habits once and for all.",
