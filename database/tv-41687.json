  "overview": "It is a well-known saying to never change on a winning team! András and Éva were winning teams. A brilliant chef and an experienced store manager created one of the best restaurants in the country, whose fame has spread across the country. The couple has become a true gastronomic legend and a restaurant called André has brought in the highest gastronomic awards in a row But what happens if the winning team still needs to change? If a third person enters the life of the couple and not only the idyll of the Balaton Uplands overturns, but also the lives of the two of them? Will the chef who sets all the rules be able to overthrow André's throne, on which he himself has sat so far, out of revenge?",
