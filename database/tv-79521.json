Each episode will take place in a different iconic location around the country. Free from the restrictions of the studio - our epic challenges are about to get a whole lot bigger.Watching on, the celebrity panel's job is simple; they must decide if each challenger will succeed - Yes or No. If they guess correctly, they'll be awarded points. The Celebrity with the most points at the end of the show will receive Â£5,000 for their chosen charity.",
