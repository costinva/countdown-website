  "overview": "Everyone has dreamed of attending their funeral. To be there and watch. Everyone wants to know who will come and who will not. Who smiles. Who weeps. Who speaks and what is said. Unfortunately, the laws of nature do not allow this. Canvas's laws do. This is shown in A Last Greeting, a new comedy show in which a well-known fellow man is given the unique privilege to attend his own funeral. A funeral to laugh with Bart Peeters as master of ceremonies.",
