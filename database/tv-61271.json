  "overview": "Cha Cha Un is a popular, albeit somewhat sarcastic magician who creates spectacular performances on stage and on television. His tricks amaze the audience, but few people know — he has a team of secret assistants! However, these are not ordinary magician's assistants: in fact, they are ghosts. But Cha Cha Un is not afraid of creatures from the spirit realm — he treats them as his employees, and they, in turn, consider him their \"boss\".One day, his paths cross with Go Seul Hae – a young passionate police officer who can also see ghosts, but is afraid of her abilities. She's investigating an incident involving one of his magic shows. And soon she realizes that the unusual abilities of a magician can become an ideal tool in the fight against crime. She manages to convince him to join the police and help catch violent criminals using his ghostly retinue.",
