  "overview": "The couple's vacation began on the paradisiacal beaches of Vietnam. But how will it end? Season 1 of the TV series \"High Season\" can be watched online. On the eve of leaving home, Misha and Anya's plans are unexpectedly interfered with. The girl meets her ex — and, as she thought, dead — boyfriend Sasha Sakhar, and soon after disappears. The police refuse to help Misha in the search for his beloved. His own investigation leads him to the captain of the People's Army of Vietnam, whose name is Tao. She is also trying to get the truth out of others about a personal tragedy — the death of her younger sister. The search for the culprits draws Tao and Misha into the cycle of the city's nightlife, full of carefully hidden secrets and deadly danger.",
