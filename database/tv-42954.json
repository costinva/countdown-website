  "overview": "This series takes viewers to the heart of iconic moments in the history of warfare: the D-Day landings, the ill-fated airborne operation at Arnhem, the German counterattack at the Battle of the Bulge and the dash for one of the last bridges standing across the Rhine at Remagen. Using eye-witness veteran testimony from those who served under fire on the front line, some many times over, each episode conveys the reality of the fast-moving, life or death nature of the key battles in the defeat of Nazi Germany in the West.",
