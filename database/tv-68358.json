  "overview": "Pareena's life had always been beautifully perfect until the demise of her father, who was like her life's sunshine. After her father's death, Pareena discovered a mystery surrounding his untimely demise and thus began a journey of discovering the mystery and restoring her father's honour. The more she digs, the more she learns how different human personalities can be in front of different people. This is not just for her later father, but also Korn, who behaves like a rebel with a free spirit, and Karn who has always been her perfect brother. The more she digs the more she realises that where there is sunshine there are also shadows. Humans can do wrong. Nobody is truly perfect.",
