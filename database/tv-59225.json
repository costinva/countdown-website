  "overview": "A unique cooking contest hosted by Scott Pickett and Poh Ling Yeow where highly awarded chefs at the top of their game go head-to-head to perfectly replicate famous Aussie snacks. Each week the chefs will wrestle a selected snack into submission in their own kitchens, before entering the Snack Arena for a cook-off judged by the very factory workers who make the snack every day. The chef whose recipe is closest to the original will take home the highly coveted Snack Trophy and bragging rights as a true Snack Master. Yvie Jones journeys deep into our food factories to find the secrets that go into the creation of Australia's favourite snacks and see where the chefs are getting it wrong â€“ and right. Featuring snacks like Twisties, Drumsticks, Whoppers and Cadbury Favourites, this is the only Aussie food show on prime-time TV where viewers know exactly how the finished results should taste, and whether our chefs have truly mastered our favourite snacks.",
