  "overview": "Aussie Lobster Men follows the real life dramas of six lobster boat captains over the last ten weeks of the winter rock lobster hunting season as they risk it all in search of the world's most prized seafood delicacy. For the lobstermen, it's their last chance to put money in the bank until the fishing grounds re-open in spring. The Southern Ocean is Australia's deadliest stretch of ocean. Against a backdrop of wild weather and treacherous seas, crews work night and day to haul in hundreds of kilograms of lobsters across slippery decks. Even a minor problem can turn deadly in a matter of moments and the nearest port is often hundreds of nautical miles away.",
