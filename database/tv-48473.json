  "overview": "Creek to Coast is Queensland's only program dedicated entirely to exploring the outdoors, playing around in the dirt and having a go at any and every form of watersport. Whether it's cruising offshore from the Gold Coast, touring a fourby across Cape York, strapping into a rally car, or jumping aboard a helicopter in the Kimberleys for an over the top fishing adventure, you'll find someone from Creek to Coast willing to give it a go.",
