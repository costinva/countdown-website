  "overview": "The story opens after a young female student kills herself by jumping off a balcony. It's soon discovered that she was in fact stabbed, and the room arranged to make it look like a suicide. And so we begin. A few minor details lead Detective Kanzo to suspect that Ryo, an enigmatic chef's assistant, knows more about her death.The two have run into each other by chance a few times, and each time left Kanzo with an uncomfortable feeling. Every clue that is revealed seems to lead to more questions about Ryo, his obsessive girlfriend, his callous and manipulative relations with several women, and about a painful memory from Kanzo's past. Things get more complicated when a powerful love/hate relationship develops between Ryo and Kanza's little sister, the beautiful Yuko (Fukatsu Eri). What exactly is their connection? As the evidence (and body count) rises, Kanzo tries desperately to save his sister from Ryo's influence. He's no saint, but is he the Devil Kanzo thinks he is? And why? The answers will floor you, even when you think you've got them figured out already.",
