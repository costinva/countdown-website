  "overview": "Soccer is the most beautiful pastime in the world and a game lasts 90 minutes? Wrong, completely wrong. It's not the most beautiful triviality, but the most beautiful trivialities that Arnd Zeigler uses to knit soccer dreams. Funny, sad, bizarre and always a little bit nasty. But who can blame him when there's something to laugh about at the end? And somehow everyone gets a turn. The good guys as well as the bad guys and the Bavarians as well as the Bremeners. Sympathy and antipathy, evenly distributed. Whether on the pitch or behind the scenes, be careful what you say dear soccer gods, Zeigler finds everything.",
