  "overview": "Royal Kill List tells an epic story of bloody revenge during a pivotal period of English history. This is a story about espionage, revenge, power, loyalty, and the moment that changed the landscape of British politics and society forever.Told through dramatic reconstruction, with three of Britain's leading actors serving as primary storytellers – Sheila Atim for the Royalists, Jared Harris for the Regicides, and Joseph Fiennes for King Charles II – this epic series plays out as a Jacobean tragedy detailing the king's lifelong obsession to hunt down and kill those responsible for his father's death and his own exile.",
