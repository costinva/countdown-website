  "overview": "A rapid-fire quiz show in which eight celebrities compete to win up to one million dollars for the charity of their choosing, these celebs will answer general knowledge questions and bank money as a group across multiple rounds. At the end of each round, the contestants vote out who they perceive to be the weakest link, and the host sends them off with the phrase, \"You are the Weakest Link. Goodbye.\" The two who make it to the final round will battle it out to determine who wins the banked money for their charity.Â ",
