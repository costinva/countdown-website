  "overview": "Bombs explode simultaneously in landfills and sorting centers around the world. REVERT, an eco-terrorist group, claims responsibility for the attacks. Their goal: to make people realize that they produce too much waste so that they reduce their consumption. In order to ensure the safety of the population, the mayor of Montreal, Canada, suspends all garbage, recycling and compost collections, turning the city into a giant garbage dump.",
