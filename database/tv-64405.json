  "overview": "Eränkävijät is a TV series about hunting and fishing in modern Finland. The series follows the stories of the main characters in the hunting and fishing community. They are united by their love for Finnish nature, even though their backgrounds and stories are different and they come from different parts of Finland. While in the north the fells are covered in snow and the lakes are frozen, in the south people still walk on the melting ground and fish in the flowing waters. And while big game is hunted on the eastern frontier, in the north the traditional methods are used to catch chickens. The conservation of game and fish stocks is still a hobby and a way of life for the wildlife enthusiast.",
