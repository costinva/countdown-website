  "overview": "From a secure job to self-employment: Toni Hasler is Munich's only male midwife—a \"lone wolf\" in an absolute women's domain. After losing his clinic job, Toni, freshly divorced and in his late thirties, feels like he has his back to the wall. However, thanks to his mentor, gynaecologist Dr. Luise Fuchs, he finds a new job. Soon, Toni struggles to work with the stubborn doctor and interferces in the conflict of an undiscovered pregnant patient and underestimates the criminal potential of his teenage daughter. As Toni's life threatens to fall apart and he feels like giving up, Luise is by his side.",
