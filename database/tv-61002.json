The story follows a heart-wrenching romance that is not without its fair share of light and comic moments. Yuan Che, the 11th Prince, almost loses his life for the sake of his country. With the help of the sorceress, his fiancee Cai Qian enters another reality that exists within a dream in order to find him. However, other forces interfere causing the Yuan Che to become completely unlike himself in personality and inactions to the point that his fiancee can no longer recognize him. Will the couple ever be truly reunited?",
