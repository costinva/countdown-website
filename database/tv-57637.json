  "overview": "Working as a writer and translator in Taiwan, Sato Itsuki has done a fairly good job of settling into his new life. Successful at work, Sato has no problems there; but with the world now in the midst of a global pandemic, he has found it rather difficult to make new friends.Â Turning to the online community, Sato soon meets Chen Bo Chun, a university senior majoring in finance and economics. Serious on the outside, Bo Chun has a hard time relating to people his own age, but has very little problem connecting with those older than him. Falling easily into conversation with Sato online, the two make a very easy and almost instant connection. Separated by a pandemic-induced quarantine, the two men have yet to meet in person, but the more time they spend together online, the closer they become.Despite the forced separation, Sato and Bo Chun's feelings for each other continue to grow. But will they ever be able to express how they feel face-to-face?",
