  "overview": "Raiders of Rock is a series, in which collectors Robert Reynolds and Stephen Shutts not only track down some of music history's most personal and valuable items, but also hunt through local flea markets, attics and garage sales in search of music's most treasured finds. From a 1960s trike owned by Elvis Presley to the last of the notorious Pink Floyd inflatable flying pigs in existence, along with items from such artists as Nirvana, the Rolling Stones, Guns N' Roses and Led Zeppelin, each episode embarks upon a fun, light-hearted and often unexpected quest with the Raiders of Rock experts as they travel to different U.S. cities in search of music memorabilia.",
