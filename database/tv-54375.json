  "overview": "Hassan, FX, Vince and Mano are four childhood friends who see their 30s knocking on their door. They then realize that they haven't enjoyed life enough. The four friends conclude a pact, drawn up by them, which will allow them to satisfy their thirst for irresponsibility, immaturity and amorous conquests. Their misadventures are interspersed with animated allegorical scenes where they are represented in the form of superheroes imagined by Hassan, the amateur cartoonist of the team: FX becomes Spirit the telepath, Vince becomes Temero the fearless man, Mano becomes Bouclius l 'indestructible and Hassan becomes Alias, able to create a duplicate of himself. Cathy, Hassan's vindictive companion, also inspires the character of Fury Cat the succubus.",
