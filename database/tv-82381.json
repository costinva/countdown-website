  "overview": "Stepping into the shoes of one of Britain's greatest Explorers, Ben Fogle and Dwayne Fields head into the heart of Africa in search of Dr David Livingstone, and the race for the source of the Nile.Africa is the world's second largest continent, three times the size of Europe, and yet until around 150 years ago more of the Moon had been mapped than this vast area. At its heart is the world's longest river, the Nile. For millennia, humans had sought the mythical source of the Nile, but all had failed. In the mid 19th Century, at the height of Britain's imperial power, it became an obsession, one that attracted extraordinary men to achieve incredible feats. This obsession inspired a race that would bring victory for one, failure for many and death for others.Following on from their BAFTA nominated series Endurance: Race to the Pole, adventurers Ben Fogle and Dwayne Fields immerse themselves into the extremes that African explorers like Livingstone, Burton, Speke and Stanley faced in their quest to find the Nile's source. Ben and Dwayne wear the same clothes, eat the same food, rely on the same kit and tread the same paths as these extraordinary Victorian explorers. Reliving the dangers, facing the challenges and ultimately experiencing first-hand the Race for the Nile.",
