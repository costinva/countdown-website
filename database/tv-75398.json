  "overview": "Six years ago at a wedding at sea, the bride Zhou Mian is maliciously left at the altar. She falls into the sea and is rescued by Mai Ke. It is only then that she learns her fianc√© Lu Yunkai is closely related to her parents' death. She forms a \"Victim Alliance\" with Mai Ke and is bent on revenge. Six years later, Zhou Mian returns to a domestic charity banquet as the top international designer He Erxin, facing Lu Yunkai head-on. Suspicious that He Erxin is his deceased wife Zhou Mian, Lu Yunkai tests her constantly. Zhou Mian does not give in and instead boldly joins Lu Yunkai's Wuxin Company. In order to expose each other's secrets and strategize against each other, the fake couple actually flirt with each other and almost get too intimate. Zhou Mian discovers that in the past six years, Lu Yunkai has never given up searching for her. There is more than meets the eye to the accident at her parents' toy factory, and Mai Ke repeatedly uses despicable means to urge Zhou Mian to defeat Lu Yunkai. At the last moment, Zhou Mian switches sides and joins forces with Lu Yunkai to resolve the crisis, uncover the truth, and rekindle their love.",
