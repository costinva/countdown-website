  "overview": "A series of mysterious murders, break-ins and other events in Avignon all have to do with the papal palace and a prophecy legend has to be contained in it. Centuries old family and organized legacies, even the murderous secret Judas brotherhood, are obsessed by it. Cops from various agencies have totally different methods and attitudes. The criminal hustle complicates several romantic affairs, whether true or manipulative. All ends seem to meet in the Esperanza family and the papal palace itself.",
