  "overview": "The Beach follows a former police officer Paramonov from the small resort town of Azov, located in the Krasnodar region. Honest and incorruptible, sincerely aspiring to fight crime, not going to make any compromises with his conscience, he was the black sheep in the background of their colleagues, the vast majority of which consisted of alcoholics, careerists and bribe-takers. In the end, when Paramonov refused the insistent offer of the authorities to take part in another fraud, he was forced to retire.",
