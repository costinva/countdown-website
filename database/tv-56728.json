  "overview": "An ordinary day of the wealthy Garber family ends with a stunning event: their daughter Lena, who completely disappeared ten years ago, appears in their gallery. She does not remember where she has been all these years and how she managed to return. Katerina Garber, who has already lost hope, immediately recognizes her as Katerina's daughter, while her husband does not believe in a miracle. Lena's return does not bring happiness to the family, but, on the contrary, makes her life unbearable, throwing the Gerbers into those moments of the past that they would prefer not to remember.",
