  "overview": "Regular national TV finance commentator and consumer advocate Effie Zahos has signed on as the Host of new business program, The Franchise Show, which will air Australia-wide on The Seven Network later this year. The weekly half-hour program will focus on the positives, the pitfalls and the personalities of franchising, profiling those at the forefront of Australia's booming small business sector. With more franchise systems per capita in Australia than anywhere else in the world, Zahos believes Australia has never been more ready to embrace The Franchise Show.",
