  "overview": "Bearing the ideal that \"criminal investigators are heroes,\" the fresh graduates from the police academy Qin Chuan and his buddies Ye Maosheng and Li Wen return to their hometown and become ordinary police officers at the police station. The huge disparity between reality and ideals does not stop him from pursuing his dreams. By chance, Qin Chuan subdues a criminal planning to cause an explosion with his bare hands, which kickstarts his career as a criminal investigator. Under the leadership of his superiors, he gradually matures and successively solves several major earth-shattering cases. When his buddy Ye Maosheng sacrifices himself heroically in a police chase, Qin Chuan becomes more aware of the responsibility that the police shoulder. Under the guidance and encouragement of his senior criminal investigators, Qin Chuan actively participates in police reform and team building from a higher perspective. He leads the team to resolve multiple long-standing cases and establishes a specialized criminal system and three-in-one information platform, creating a modern and professional criminal investigation team, and realizing his dream of becoming an excellent Chinese criminal investigator.",
