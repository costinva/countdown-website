  "overview": "In the year 2655, a generation-long battle rages between the Terran Confederation and the evil Kilrathi, a feline-like race of savages bent on destroying humanity. A trio of spirited novice fighter pilots are thrust into battle under the command of the legendary Commodore Geoffrey Tolwyn. Skills will be tested and friendships forged as they fly missions more dangerous than they could have ever imagined.",
