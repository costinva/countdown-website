  "overview": "Salt Lake City friends and baking experts Brenda Nibley and Alisha Nuttall transform their clients' wildest requests into edible masterpieces for the holidays. The duo dreams up incredible cookie builds and decadent tasting treats and then gets to work with the help of their Gingerbread Dream Team of amazing bakers and even a carpenter to make it all happen in time for the event. Their edible creations include a five-foot-tall nutcracker, a six-foot-long reproduction of Main Street decked out for Christmas, a life-sized turkey and a replica of Salt Lake City's famous clock tower, proving that if you can dream it, they can build it -- and then you can eat it!",
