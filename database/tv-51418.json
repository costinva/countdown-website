  "overview": "No asteroid struck the Earth, no terrorists put the world in danger, no atomic war started, but something has still gone very wrong. Contact between most towns and cities on Earth has been severed. A small ring-like area in Eastern Europe still has electricity, and life signs are still being reported from Space. But what military forces find outside this Ring is shocking. There are dead corpses everywhere: in stores, in cars, on roads, in hospitals and railway stations. Who or what is destroying all life on Earth. Who or what is destroying all life on Earth. How long will the last Blackout of humankind survive?",
