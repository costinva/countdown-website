  "overview": "Futureville Ireland is co-funded by Science Foundation Ireland and is presented by Carla O'Brien (Crimecall) and Dr Lorraine (Lollie) Mancey (UCD Innovation Centre). The Series is a three-part science magazine format with a mission to explore the big ideas from Irish scientists that could one day shape Ireland's future. ‘Futureville' will use 3d VFX &amp; stylised graphics to reimagine the midlands town of Athlone as Ireland's first ever city of the future, providing the audience with a credible sense of what Athlone could look like and what everyday life might be look for those that live and work there in 2050. This project is co-funded by Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland (formerly Science Foundation Ireland)",
