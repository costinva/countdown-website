  "overview": "The telenovela tells the story of Franz and Amélia, who fall in love, although they are from different social classes, and that love is born Pérola. However, they have an obstacle to be happy: Franz's father, Ernest, who will do anything to separate Franz from Amélia and take custody of his granddaughter and will therefore frame Amélia, putting her behind from jail unjustly for thinking that a son should have someone of his social class as his wife. The light of this dysfunctional family is Pérola, daughter of Franz and Amélia. She is a very valuable and special child, a fact that can be explained by the monks: she would be the reincarnation of Ananda. Pérola's mission is to teach people to love unconditionally, and this will light up their grandfather's heart with tenderness and affection. ",
