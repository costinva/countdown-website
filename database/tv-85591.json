  "overview": "In London, a major trauma happens every 60 minutes, and for the NHS, each call is a race against time. Critical: Between Life and Death gets inside the minds of the dedicated trauma teams that hold our lives in their hands when the worst happens.From the makers of the award-winning 24 Hours in A&amp;E and with exclusive access, 40 cameras are embedded for 21 days across the entire London Major Trauma System. The documentary series goes over the shoulder and under the scalpel to reveal not only the life-saving interventions but also the personal, emotional, and sometimes traumatic reasons that inspire those on the NHS frontline to do a job where every second counts.",
