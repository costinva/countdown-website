  "overview": "High school sweethearts and married couple, Daphne Reckert and Ian Figueira, will abandon their plans of living in a California tiny home when Daphne inherits her late grandfather's 500-year-old chateau on a 130-acre estate just outside of Paris, France.While the main floor of the sprawling property—which once welcomed guests like King Louis XIII— provides a steady income stream hosting weddings, the young couple will take on the incredibly daunting task of restoring the remaining dilapidated floors and buildings on the grounds, utilizing their carpentry, conservation and landscaping expertise, as well as their families' backgrounds in construction, design and renovation. With passion, determination and grit, Daphne and Ian will confront budget constraints, battle bug infestations, hunt for rumored hidden treasure and tackle a seemingly endless list of projects head-on to breathe new life into the historic estate and preserve her grandfather's legacy.  ",
