  "overview": "More than twenty years ago, the fates of seven children intertwined in an orphanage. Wiktor, Michał, Andrzej, Basia, Leszek, Weronika and Gabriela promised each other that for the rest of their lives they would support each other and that none of them would ever be left alone. Their angel - guardian was Maria Zięba, who at that time worked in an orphanage and loved these children as her own. Over time, their friendship grew into a bond stronger than blood bonds.",
