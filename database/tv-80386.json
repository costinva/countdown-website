  "overview": "Reckless thrill-seeker Qin Lang has only one dream, become a narcotics officer, yet on graduation he's dumped into the Anti-Fraud Center. To transfer out faster, he's forced to partner with the icy, razor-sharp Gao Man, and the two become instant frenemies. Case by case, their crackdowns shatter fraud rings, and Qin starts to feel the pull of this new battlefield, until the day he discovers that the fraud syndicate's kingpin is inextricably linked to the drug lord he's sworn to take down.",
