  "overview": "Thirty years ago, Korn and Intouch were university students in Bangkok. Intouch entered into Korn's life despite knowing that he was a son of the most influential people. At first, Korn kept pushing Intouch away, but in the end, he could not resist Intouch who was so full of life and decided to let him into his heart. However, homosexuality was unacceptable at the time, and so their parents were against their relationship. While Intouch kept fighting for their future, Korn could not deal with all the sufferings and decided to give up. Their story ended with tragedy, but something has tied them together even after they were dead.Â Years after, Pharm (Intouch's reincarnation), always feels that he is waiting to meet 'someone.' Dean (Korn's reincarnation) also spends his entire life searching for 'the one.' The red thread of fate will bring them together and ties them to the past that is not worth remembering.",
