  "overview": "The International Tennis Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony is an annual awards event that airs on the Tennis Channel. The event airs live annually from the site of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, the original location of the U.S. National Championships. This ceremony also includes an international tennis tournament that has been held every year in July since 1976. The event, which was part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit from 1976â€“1989, features a 32-player singles draw and a doubles tournament. Each year that the tournament has been held there is an induction ceremony for the Hall of Fame. The tournament is held on outdoor grass courts, and is the last grass court tournament of the season on the ATP tour and the only grass court tournament played outside of Europe. Up until 2011, when John Isner won the tournament the top seed had never triumphed at Newport, a trait that has led to the moniker \"the Casino Curse,\" due to the location of the Hall of Fame at the Newport Casino.",
