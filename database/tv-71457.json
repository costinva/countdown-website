  "overview": "Mai Chenghuan, a girl born in an ordinary family in Shanghai in the 1990s, is urged by her mother, Liu Wanyu, to discuss marriage with her boyfriend, Xin Jialiang. However, the affluent economic conditions of Xin's family upset the originally equal emotional relationship. At the same time, Mai's mother's excessive interference in her daughter's lifelong affairs accelerates the breakup between Mai Chenghuan and Xin Jialiang. Caught between filial piety and loyalty to oneself, Mai Chenghuan struggles. She gradually breaks free from her mother's dominant care and becomes more focused and enterprising in her work. Mai Chenghuan's transformation is recognized by her grandmother, who entrusts her with the important responsibility of managing the family's most valued hotel business. Yao Zhiming, the grandson of the grandmother and a professional hotel manager, gradually understands and approves of Mai Chenghuan in their cooperation. They become work partners, advancing hand in hand. In their personal lives, Yao Zhiming is surrounded by the warmth beneath the fireworks of the Mai family, and his feelings for Mai Chenghuan gradually heat up. From \"beneath Chenghuan's knees\" to \"achieving self,\" Mai Chenghuan has embarked on an extraordinary journey of growth that is uniquely her own.",
