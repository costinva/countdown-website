  "overview": "Divided into three separate four-hour miniseries, Missions That Changed the War profiles: \"The Doolittle Raid,\" a seemingly insignificant mission that was designed to boost American morale but in retrospect, had a vital effect on the war with Japan; \"Germany's Last Ace,\" a first-person account of Gunter Rall, the most decorated aviator in Hitler's Luftwaffe, as he describes the misguided Nazi strategy on the eastern front; and \"The Flying Tigers,\" a series of bombing missions that prevented the fall of China.",
