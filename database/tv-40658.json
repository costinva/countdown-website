  "overview": "Deux flics sur les docks is a gritty French crime series about the war on the streets in the port city of Le Havre. The two cops on the front lines of the brutal turf battles are the police department''s odd couple, inspectors Richard Faraday and Paul Winckler. Faraday''s the epitome of a by-the-book guy, to the point of rigidity, while Winkler is a grizzled rogue cop who values friendship above procedure. Theirs is an on-again, off-again partnership but when they do manage to work together, they tend to get the job done. Between them, they set out to solve a succession of grisly deaths plaguing the underbelly of this working-class city in the north-west of France.",
