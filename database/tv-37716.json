  "overview": "Trini is an orchestra singer who has been touring Spain for the last few years. However, her sister Luisa appears after a performance to tell her she is dying. A reason that forces her to leave her passion to return to La Gloria, the neighborhood in which she grew up and where her whole family lives. There she will meet again with her family, her friends and with what was the love of his life. The ex of Trini is owner of \"La bamba\", a karaoke bar that has seen better times but again begins to emerge. Little by little \"La Bamba\" will become the meeting point of the neighbors of the whole neighborhood, a place to let off steam and be happy with music, lots of music. She will also take care of her nephews, Paula and Nacho, and her father.",
