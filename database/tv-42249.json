  "overview": "Animal Planet's large predator expert Dave Salmoni heads deep into the African bush on a double mission - to return to his wild roots and to save a rogue pride of lions from elimination. Big cats, and especially lions, have long been his passion, but recently, Dave has been spending most of his time in the urban jungle as a television producer and host. Now, in Into the Pride, all his toughness, training and focus are put to the test. Can he survive six months in the Namibian bush on a life or death quest? Dave must help a pride of \"problem lions\" learn to accept humans. These are last-chance lions; if they don't calm down, they will be destroyed. The only way to get into these lions' heads is by getting on foot and heading straight into the pride. He has to forge relationships with every lion. Dave needs to become the first human they can trust.",
