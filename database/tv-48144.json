  "overview": "Like the rest of us, Michelle Visage is on lockdown, but that hasn't stopped her from enlisting her husband as a cameraman, throwing open the doors of her family home, and inviting you to her weekly house party, where she's just doing her best to keep things light, stay busy and check in with her friends, all of whom she asks: \"How's your head, hun?\" Quarantini anyone?",
