  "overview": "Some people want their wedding to be so perfect they're willing to fight for it. Literally. On VH1's new series Wedding Wars, hosted by Michelle Merkin, 12 engaged couples will battle each other for the destination wedding of a lifetime. Wedding Wars is a competition-elimination show where each week teams of soon-to-be brides and grooms will fight tooth and nail for a shot at their dream wedding and incredible prizes. BUT these couples are in for a huge shock when they learn they won't be competing at a five star resort or getting any special treatment. Instead, the couples are being exiled to a remote island with little food or water and will be voted off the island by the competing couples. To win the wedding of their dreams, the couples must brave the elements and survive in the wilderness as they compete in demanding challenges that offer extravagant wedding prizes. Each couple will find out if they can stick together through better or worse to win a destination wedding they will be talking about for the rest of their lives.",
