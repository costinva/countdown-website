  "overview": "In several period cases, it shows the atmosphere of a time when crime jumped to unexpected heights and when it was decided whether the police would find and hold their role. In the \"1990s\", freedom for all brings a sharp increase in crime. The police have no method, time or resources to deal with it. It seems that big and small bastards will definitely have the upper hand. The young investigator Tomáš Kozák joins the Prague 1st Department. Experienced operative Václav Plíšek does not trust his new colleague. But they have to face an unprecedented supply of murders together.",
