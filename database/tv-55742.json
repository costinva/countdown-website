  "overview": "Jim Eli loves cars, and in his hometown of Great Falls, Montana, he and his family are always on the hunt for great cars that they can find, pick and restore to a pristine finish before flipping them for a profit. Jim's family of auto experts help him find the right repairs, for the right price to restore these classic cars back to their original glory. In the Eli family business, profit is the name of the game but it's helpful to have fun along the way.",
