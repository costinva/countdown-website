  "overview": "Through unparalleled access, The Stanford Prison Experiment: Unlocking the Truth embarks on a gripping, ticking-clock journey through the six-day Stanford Prison Experiment with a deluge of reveals, new subjects and a smoking-gun archive. The docuseries weaves together shocking, poignant and sometimes humorous firsthand accounts from the very participants who were at the heart of the experiment. Then, in an unexpected turn, the series brings the participants to a replica film set of the \"prison,\" where they revisit pivotal moments and attempt to find consensus — and closure — about what really happened over the course of those six days.",
