  "overview": "In a first-of-its-kind reality TV show focused specifically on diabetes will be airing this summer on the Discovery Life Channel. Created by celebrity chef Charles Mattocks, a type 2 himself since 2009 who happens to be a nephew of the late great reggae music legend Bob Marley, this new \"docu-series\" features five PWDs (people with diabetes) with both type 1 and type 2 aiming to change the way they think about their health. Reversed is a show about people with diabetes who will change their lives -- emotionally, physically, and spiritually. It's not so much about reversing diabetes, as it is about changing one's lifestyle and attitude, changing who we are as people, and bringing out the best in all of us. Chef Charles Mattocks helps five people living with diabetes transform their lifestyle choices with help from nutritionists, trainers, doctors, therapists and celebrity guests.",
