  "overview": "One-sided love is always a series of choices. I secretly think about you, but an invisible wall called \"friend\" stands in my way. I wanted to break down that wall, but I couldn't... A manager chasing his dream, and the regulars who lost their dreams. All sorts of human dramas take place in this restaurant. Why do sweet-sounding things like love and dreams hurt so much? A short drama series set in a peculiar caf√©, each depicting a step forward and growing up.",
