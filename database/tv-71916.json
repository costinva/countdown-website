  "overview": "When supernatural creatures – nicknamed ‘Spookies' - start appearing in the small Australian town of Sunny Valley, long-time Spookyphile Bert is thrilled. He assembles the ‘Spooky Crew,' consisting of his best bud and gadget queen Xena, his super-cool sorta step-sis Billie, and Derek, their school's sports captain - an ‘undercover agent' who keeps his Spooky beliefs a secret. Their mission: to capture the ‘Spookies,' figure out where they're coming from, and safely return them ‘home' – wherever that may be!The series blends contemporary characters and retro delights from the 80s and 90s with mystery, humour, nostalgia and just the right amount of scary. Each episode features a new Spooky surprise, from a humungous flying clown head to a punk rock truth fairy and even a Fart Blob.",
