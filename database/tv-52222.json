  "overview": "A nerdy second-year dental student Pi falls in love with a kind-hearted fellow second-year Muang Nan from the Faculty of Allied Health Science; but he's too scared to confess. Muang Nan is like a \"fish upon the sky\", way too out of reach for someone as boring as him. That's why Pi asks his big brother Duean for some advice. After going through a major makeover with the help of his brother, the now cooler-than-ever Pi plucks up enough courage to approach Muang Nan. But a new problem arises when Mork, the hottest medical student, appears out of nowhere and seems to be aiming for Muang Nan, too. Discouraged and very much afraid, Pi once again turns to his big brother for help. But this time, Duean is caught up in a mess of his own when he can't shake an annoying freshman medical student Meen off his side. And so Pi must face this battle alone to win Muang Nan's love. But as the rivalry goes on, why does it feel as if Mork is hitting on him instead? Pi plunges into full confusion as his feelings for Mork start to change. What should he do with this feeling and will he ever dare to confess?",
