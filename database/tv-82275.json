  "overview": "Since childhood, Pavel was nicknamed the Chess Player - both for his passion for a noble game, and for his ability to think extraordinary, build intricate combinations, and calculate opponent's moves. All this came in handy for the Chess Player in the troubled fate that the profession of a military intelligence officer imposed on him, and the circumstances of life after leaving for a \"civilian\". It is not in Paul's character to indulge in the charms of civil life while there are offended people in the world.",
