  "overview": "Linnea moves from a small town in Ostrobothnia to her grandmothers apartment in Helsinki to study journalism. She comes from a family where her father is an alcoholic and moves away to focus on her studies. During the summer before school starts she gets to know Ellen, a cool feminist from Porvoo who writes for the feminist magazine Astra. Linnea also gets to know Viktor, a charming and confident guy from the wealthy Westend area. Linnea and Viktor fall in love and she quickly notices that she has come in between two very different worlds, Vicke`s hedonistic upper-class gang and Ellen`s norm-critical friends. The summer fills up with parties, love, friendship and lies.",
