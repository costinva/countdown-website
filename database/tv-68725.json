  "overview": "The Moors Murders shocked Britain in the 1960s. Five children tortured and murdered at the hands of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady. Countless documentaries have focused on Hindley, the antithesis of everything society believes a woman to be, but this series turns the lens on Brady to take a unique look at what made Ian Brady into arguably the UK's worst ever serial killer.",
