  "overview": "By divine mercy, I was given chances to start over. On my first rebirth, oh no, the poisoned wine was already at my lips. Couldn't the gods have hit rewind just a little earlier? The second time around, I stopped that idiot, but I couldn't stop his bumbling accomplices. Dragged down by the team, I died again... And then, on my final reincarnation, I returned to the eve of the bestowed marriage, not yet married. This time, I'm done playing!!",
