  "overview": "Juan is a 30-year-old single man who is forced to attend a family event with a boyfriend. \"I imagine that you will come accompanied\" (MIQVA) tells him his mother, who has accepted his homosexuality with effort and cannot conceive from her heteronormative paradigm that her son, moreover, is not in a relationship. In an urgency to avoid problems and prejudices, he hires a Taxi Boy as a companion, and gathers his friends for a Friday preview to break the news and ask for their advice. Between music, games, drinks and choreography, they will discuss the advances and limitations of the gender perspective in our country, while they wait for Juan's fictitious boyfriend. What discourses come into play today among people who belong to the generation of \"the that they couldn't get married?",
