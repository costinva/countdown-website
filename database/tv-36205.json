  "overview": "Microsoap is based around Emily Parker and her brother Joe, whose parents are total opposites. Their mom like to Bungee Jump and eat Baked Beans out of cans, whereas their Dad arranges cans of soup in alphabetical order. So they divorce. Their mom meet a builder named Roger, and Roger buys the house next door to the Parkers and knocks down the wall between the homes so it's just one big house where Roger, Mom, Emily, Joe and Roger's three children David, Felicity and Robbie can live in. Their dad meets a therapist and he marries her.",
