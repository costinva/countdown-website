After settling their misunderstandings, the two young men are immediately drawn to each other. Although Shake and Ken's close friends support their blossoming intimate relationship, Sandee, Ken's childhood friend becomes envious and tells his conservative widowed mother -- preempting their romantic love affair. Relationships are strained and tension mounts at home, Shake and Ken eventually find themselves parting ways.
