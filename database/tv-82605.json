  "overview": "Twelve strangers arrive at a grand English country estate, lured by one irresistible opportunity: to inherit a chunk of a vast fortune. The fortune belonged to a glamorous benefactor known only as The Deceased who has left video messages for the players from beyond the grave. To release money from The Inheritance, players must work as a team to complete a series of challenges. The better they perform; the more money is released. But The Deceased had a wicked sense of humour and one ruthless condition: to win the game they must persuade all others that only they should be entrusted with the money. It's a game of wit, willpower, persuasion, and betrayal, where it's not about who deserves the money, but who's willing to outplay, out-charm, and out-scheme the competition to claim it.",
