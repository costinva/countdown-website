  "overview": "The dramatic weeks of the \"German Autumn 1977\", the RAF kidnapping of employer president Hanns Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of the Lufthansa plane \"Landshut\" by a Palestinian terrorist commando kept the republic in suspense almost 30 years ago. With archive footage, eyewitness interviews and staged game scenes, the two-part film \"Todesspiel\" by Heinrich Breloer recalls the events of those 45 days and was euphorically celebrated after it was first broadcast almost 10 years ago.",
