  "overview": "At the birthday party of an old King closer to the end of his life than the beginning, a mysterious witch interrupts the festivities and kidnaps several children, including the young princess of the Kingdom. Despite his advanced age, his tired bones and his apparent weakness, the King decides to take up arms one last time, to go and rescue the children. This is how he embarks on what will be his very last adventure, accompanied by his old comrades, also crumbling, but more than ever motivated to shine once again.",
