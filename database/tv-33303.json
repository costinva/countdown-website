  "overview": "Vegas is all about celebrating, and Freed's Bakery makes it happen! In the front, it might look like a neighborhood bakery, but in their secret back room their artists make the most fun, outrageous and elaborate cakes in town -- including a giant Cadillac cake for the Viva Las Vegas rockabilly weekend, a stunt man's birthday cake illustrating a legendary record jump, and a cake celebrating a new school made out of books, chalkboards and lockers. With 58 years in the business, Freed's is known for their great flavors and amazing creativity, always sure to wow their guests and bring a sugary good side to Sin City that's never been seen before.",
