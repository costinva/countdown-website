  "overview": "The three boys at the center of the story come from different realities, yet they are linked by something stronger: Bea is a Latin American girl, torn between loyalty to her family and her gang and the desire to change her life; Ludo and Mahdi are two friends united as brothers. The background to the whole story between generational conflicts, female empowerment, ambition and, above all, the struggle for the conquest of power is Block 181, a building complex in the Milanese suburbs that will become the scene of a story of love, of revenge, of freedom and personal affirmation.Â ",
