  "overview": "A young woman from southern Baden goes jogging and never comes back. After an intensive search, her body is found a few days later. Beaten to death by an unknown person. A special investigation unit is put together and begins to meticulously secure evidence - until a second murder occurs just 30 kilometers away and the team has to find out whether and how the two cases are connected. The four-part series \"Spuren\" is based on true events, without exploiting or dramatizing the two crimes that shook the region around Freiburg in 2016. This is not about quick sensationalism, about the bloody celebration of two terrible crimes, it is more about classic police work.",
