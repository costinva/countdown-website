  "overview": "When an accident occurs in the ocean off the unforgiving Alaskan coastline, the US Coast Guard gets the first call to assist and rescue those in trouble executing as many as 200 rescues a year. With the full cooperation of the USCG, the series premiere of In Harm's Way takes an up-close look at one of these rescue units as its operatives go about their daily and often dangerous routines. The one-hour unscripted reality series is hosted by former Navy Fighter Pilot, and Emmy award-winner Hunter Ellis and, each week, will follow a different group of brave individuals who risk their lives in a multitude of life-threatening jobs.",
