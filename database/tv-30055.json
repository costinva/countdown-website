  "overview": "Blonde bombshell and \"celebreality\" vixen, Megan Hauserman is looking for love -- but not with any average Joe. Megan has her eye, mind and heart set on one type of man... a millionaire! Unfortunately, Megan's had her heart broken by Bret Michaels in Rock of Love 2 and lost out on the million dollar check in I Love Money. But now she's back with vengeance to find both love and money with the goal of becoming the ultimate trophy wife. This summer, Megan will put 18 millionaires to the test as they compete for her affection in Megan Wants a Millionaire. Megan's millionaire suitors will compete in challenges ranging from going head to head in a high roller Las Vegas tournament to shelling out money in a date auction. Whoever wins the challenge, will win a date with Megan. But, it won't just be any date. The millionaires will be given the chance to \"upgrade\" their date. How about driving Megan to dinner in an Aston Martin, instead of an Escalade? Or why not take a helicopter ride to Catalina Island instead of the ferry? One by one, Megan will eliminate the guys who can't shell out the dough, until the ultimate millionaire is left.",
