  "overview": "There is anemia in Transylvania and the noble vampire family Rysberg, who has driven hotels in his old horror castle, is forced to move to a 3a in the suburbs of Stockholm where the busy mother Bettan has managed to get a job at the blood center. But it's not quite easy to live double life as a vampire in the world of living, especially when old relatives and zombie poles are stubborn to visit. And when the very old Greve Dracula, the old man, arrives to make sure that the family is still living like vampires, the family ends up in a bad snap. The family Rysberg consists of mother Bettan, father Drak-Olle, big sister Vampyrella and the adoptive son Uffe, who is the wolf.",
