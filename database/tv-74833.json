The day when the family Schmidtsteiner finds the neglected, completely intimidated guy in the wood, that's the beginning of a new turbulent time for Dad, Mom, the nine-year-old Nele and and especially for Lukas, who becomes Schlunz' best friend. The only thing, on what the boy with the tousled hair remembers, is, that he was called \"der Schlunz\".",
