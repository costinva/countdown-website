  "overview": "It wasn't long after the 2010 \"Storage Wars\" premiere that series star Barry Weiss emerged as a fan favorite. The longtime antiques collector viewed buying the contents of abandoned storage lockers as a hobby, and an auction became the perfect place to display his omnipresent fun-loving, devil-may-care attitude. Whether he wore night vision goggles or employed psychics to help him decipher a locker's worth, Barry was always seeking outlandish ways to gain an edge on the competition. \"Best Buys\" compiles the most memorable purchases -- and antics -- of the treasure hunter during his four seasons on the show.",
