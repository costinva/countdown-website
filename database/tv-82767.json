  "overview": "She's the third daughter of the Jiang family, determined to defy societal norms and inherit the family business. She hires the low-born yet principled male lead as her bodyguard. Their worlds couldn't be more different. Her reckless behavior constantly challenges his limits, yet irresistibly draws him into a whirlpool of passion. But reality forces them apartâ€”she's married off, and he enlists in the army. When the nation collapses and she falls into despair, he returns to save her. Amid the chaos, they finally confess their love.",
