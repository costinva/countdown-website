  "overview": "For the first time in Australia, television cameras were given unprecedented 24-hour access into an Australian mosque for The Mosque Next Door.Brisbane's Holland Park Mosque is one of the oldest in Australia. Located near Pauline Hanson's former electorate when she was first elected to federal parliament, the mosque has found itself in the firing line amidst growing fears from some in the wider community that Islam is contrary to the ‘Australian way of life'.   Now, the mosque throws open its doors for a look at a year in the life of the people inside — through the realities of life, love and a struggle for acceptance in modern Australia.",
