  "overview": "Crowning South America, Colombia touches both the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. Sitting on the equator, this wild and exotic land is divided by the soaring peaks of the Andes and carved by the mighty Amazon and Orinoco Rivers. Colombia's landscapes are vast and hugely diverse. Mangroves meander through grasslands, while expanses of mirror-like wetlands fringe verdant rainforests. Snow-capped peaks emerge from mountain slopes clad in misty cloud forests. This mix of pristine environments supports an enormous wealth of unique plants, as well as an extraordinary array of spectacular creatures.",
