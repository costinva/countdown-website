  "overview": "6-grader Kolya Gerasimov discovers a time machine in a basement of\n an old house in Moscow and gets transferred into the 21st century. \nThere he is allowed to look around. Accidentally, Kolya witnesses two \nspace pirates who arrive from Saturn and later try to steal a device \ncalled a \"Mielophone\" (which can read thoughts) from Alisa Seleznyova - a\n girl that performs experiments with this device and animals. Kolya \nmanages to save the device from the pirates and brings it back to the \n20th century. But both pirates and Alisa get there too. Alisa knows \nwhere Kolya studies but doesn't know what he looks like. Pirates saw \nKolya, but don't know anything about him.  © by Boris Shafir",
