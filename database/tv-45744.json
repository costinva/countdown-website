Kana, nicknamed Hatena, is the couple's daughter and his childhood friend. As the hustle and bustle activities in Tokyo catches Makoto off guard such as burglaries by a beautiful thief, he depends on Hatena's comforting side. When he came to Hoshisato's now-haunted mansion to reunite with his childhood friend, he is greeted by the family's butler and maid, Jeeves and Emma along with Hatena, only to discover that they are not as compatible anymore.",
