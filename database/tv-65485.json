  "overview": "Subaru's Great Australian Detour with Andrew Daddo encourages Aussies to take a detour and go the long way, back through the towns that the highway now passes, or follow those brown tourist signs that you have seen and always wondered what is down there. This series is all about the drive, giving ourselves more time to discover, a greater chance to connect, and more opportunities to learn, laugh and grow together, finding those unexpectedly awesome moments along the way.",
