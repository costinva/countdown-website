  "overview": "19-year-old Onodera Ichiro, who was born and raised in an Edo residence, is hastily summoned to return to his hometown after his father, the chief attendant of feudal lord processions, is killed in an accidental fire at home. Ichiro's family is the Makisakas of West Mino. Although the Makisakas are vassals of the shogun with 7,500 koku, they are a distinguished family that has the status of a feudal lord. The role of the chief attendant is to manage the entire journey from the preparation of the procession of the feudal lord to his alternate residence. Fire caused by negligence is actually a grave offense that would result in confiscation of their stipend, but Ichiro is ordered to be the chief attendant because of the impending departure of the procession. However, he has never taken over the role from his father. If he should fail, there is a possibility that this could be the end of the family line. Assailed from all sides and with no one he can turn to, Ichiro decides to rely on the ancestral records of the processions, which his father had risked his life to protect, and heads for Edo. This is a battle to him. But in fact, the procession this time has been set up to bring down the feudal lord in an attempt to usurp the family.",
