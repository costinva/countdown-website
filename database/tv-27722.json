  "overview": "Comic Iliza Shlesinger hosts Truth &amp; Iliza, a late-night talk show that features episodes that revolve around particular themes, in the form of a question that Iliza tries to answer. She uses audience interaction, field pieces, commentary and -- what she's best known for -- jokes to help her find the answers she seeks. The weekly series focuses on discussing the sociopolitical issues of the day, whether they involve necessary discussions or more inane topics. As Iliza puts it, the show \"occupies a space between social commentary, politics, pop culture and my specific brand of comedy and feminism\".",
