  "overview": "Eight sexy singles are leaving for paradise for a summer full of love... At least that's what they think. They party, date and flirt like crazy in sweltering temperatures with a tropical setting. The perfect conditions for early romance, one-night-stands or maybe they find their true (holiday)lover? Just when romance starts to build up, it is abruptly ended by the unexpected visit of their former lovers. Some may want their revenge, some will do anything to win back their ex. One thing is for sure; hiding is meaningless as nobody knows where and when a new ex may appear on scene. Who'se EX is next?",
