  "overview": "Proving once and for all that you can't keep a good Slayer down, Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season Eight Motion Comic picks up where the smash hit TV show left off! The Hellmouth may have been destroyed, but the world still needs saving and Buffy Summers is back at her butt-kicking, demon-slaying best to do the job. She's relocated her base of operations to a castle in Scotland to lead the Scooby Gang, including hundreds of newly activated Slayers scattered around the world to battle the supernatural forces of evil.",
