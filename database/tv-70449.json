  "overview": "On 21 September 1992, Kenley Matheson-a 20-year-old first-year Acadia University student-disappeared from Wolfville, Nova Scotia, without a trace. No eyewitnesses came forward. No body was found. No suspects emerged, and no leads surfaced. For three decades, investigators and private detectives hired by the family have been stumped.",
