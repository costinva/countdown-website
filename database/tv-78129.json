  "overview": "After rigorous cultivation, humans can ascend to become gods. Above gods are immortals, and above immortals are emperors. Jiang Feng, after a thousand years of hard cultivation, finally ascended to become the Nine Extremes Immortal Emperor. Once mortals broke through the realm of the Immortal Emperor, they could tear through the rift of space and time to defy fate. Determined to rectify all his past regrets, Jiang Feng decided to return to the mortal world. However, upon his return, he discovered that his benefactor, Master Liu, had been poisoned and was in critical condition; his wife, Liu Chenfei, the most beautiful woman in Jiangcheng, was being forced into remarriage; and the entire Jiang family of 138 members had been massacred. At this moment, Jiang Feng unsheathed his Tiangang Sword, which had been sealed for a thousand years.",
