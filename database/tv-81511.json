  "overview": "Join Belfast comedians Shane Todd and Ciarán Bartlett for a new sketch show showcasing the best of Northern Ireland's new comic talent.From cringe-worthy encounters to moments of pure slapstick, the show will feature sketches on the creation of the horse on day six of the universe; the inevitable outbreak of a Mafia war at the hands of a dodgy go-between; bad life and business coaching, and sketches depicting scenes of comedic modern ‘torture'.Expect cinematic parodies, surprising twists, and the kind of humour that only Northern Ireland's comedy scene can deliver.",
