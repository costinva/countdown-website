An ambitious young Vladimir took the place of the old director of the LVZ, who was imprisoned under house arrest. On the very first day, he sets his own rules and gets rid of everything old. Namely, he fires the old secretary Dina, who was the soul of the team, the audacious assembly line technician Ira and the young technologist Tatiana, who is too demanding of quality standards.Desperate to find another job in their town, these three women, thrown out of their native factory, decide to make... their own.",
