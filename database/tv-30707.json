  "overview": "Over the course of the four-hour series, Sagal hits the road, travelling\n cross country on a customized red, white and blue Harley-Davidson, to \nfind out where the Constitution lives, how it works, and how it unites \nus as a nation. From New York to San Francisco, from Missoula, Montana \nto Tyler, Texas, Sagal visits dozens of cities and small towns across \nAmerica introducing viewers to some of today's major constitutional \ndebates—free speech in the digital age, same-sex marriage, voting \nrights, separation of church and state, presidential power in the \npost-9/11 world, to name just a few—and the fascinating stories of the \npeople they affect every day.",
