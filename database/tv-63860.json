  "overview": "Man's love affair with fast, beautiful cars is enduring. Few sports can match the vitality, the sheer extravagance and spectacle of a motor race. The Power and the Glory is a vivid account of the development of this exhilarating popular culture from the pioneer days in the 1880's and the birth of the sport in France in the early 1890's, through The Golden Age with the Bentley Boys and the Bugatti Set, right up to the commercialisation and the glittering prizes of the present with Fangio, Moss, Senna and Mansell along the way - a century of magnificent sport.",
