  "overview": "Every year, many people decide to open a hotel or guest house, but getting started in this business is anything but easy. In each episode of Our Dream Hotel, camera's follow the whole journey of one couple or family's project. From finding the perfect location, through the renovation and the make or break first weeks of running the business. From the daring families investing every penny to build a seaside guesthouse, to urbanites swapping their city home for a sprawling, derelict chateau in France, and the drama of overrun projects and mounting over spend. How will they fair in this new adventure of a lifetime as they aim to fulfil their hotel ambition?",
