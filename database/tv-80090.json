  "overview": "To stop a madman before he kills - or kills again - sometimes the only option is to get inside the mind of a monster. These cops engage in high-stakes, one-on-one battles of wits with the most dangerous and deadly criminals, predicting their next moves before they strike. In these psychological life-or-death chess matches, only one will emerge victorious. Everyone is playing for keeps, and a single wrong move can have deadly consequences.",
