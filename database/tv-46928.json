  "overview": "Andrea Fanti loses his memories of the last twelve years of his life because of a cerebral trauma, and, for the first time, he finds himself not to be the smartest, renowned medic as usual, but a simple patient. Without the memories from his life, the man falls in an unknown world where loved ones are strangers, and the hospital becomes the only place where he truly feels at home. Inspired to the real life of Doctor Pier Dante Piccioni.",
