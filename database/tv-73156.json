  "overview": "The first talk show in Russia where problems are not just talked about - they are solved directly on the air. Those who are desperate to cope with their endless failures and protracted conflicts come to the studio. Professionals come to their aid: psychologists, psychotherapists, nutritionists, philanthropists. The stories discussed in the studio will not leave anyone indifferent - after all, anyone can encounter them.",
