  "overview": "In China's Wild Side, explore two very different wildlife ecosystems that are both surprising and rich with diversity. Tibet, dominated by a vast high altitude plateau, is home to animals that have evolved to cope with the thin air; from the great bovine, the wild yak, to snake that can only live in volcanic springs. While, Yunnan -a lush subtropical paradise - has perhaps the greatest diversity of all of China's regions, home to the nation's only elephants, as well as the highest living primates on earth, the bizarre snub-nosed monkeys.",
