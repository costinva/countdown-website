  "overview": "The distant future... Russia continues to successfully emerge from the ever-deepening crisis... In the heart of the Motherland, instead of a mausoleum, two unknown people built \"Akademiya Aobstvennykh Ashibok\", where the whole country continues to go, out of habit...This program was more serious and aimed at an older audience. It discussed the problems of economics and society in an allegorical and comic form, and examined various historical periods and forms of government.",
