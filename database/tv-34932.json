  "overview": "The series revolves around the lives of two families. The Moustoxides family is from a poor neighborhood and working class, however their young daughter, Betty, wins a reality singing show (much like Pop Idol) and ends up a superstar with the family becoming very rich. They move in next door to the Papapavlos family who are sophisticated Athenians. At the heart of the story is the on-off relationship between Aris Moustoxidis and Lisa Papapavlou.",
