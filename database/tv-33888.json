  "overview": "This isn't reality television, this is real. Instead of trying to follow college students around with a camera crew in an attempt to capture the essence of their lives, MTV has handed the cameras over to a group of students to let them tell their own stories of College Life. Eight freshman and sophomore students -- Josh, Alex, Lindsay, Andrea, Dan, Anna, Jordan and Kevin -- attending school in Madison, Wisconsin, have been equipped with cameras and given a mission: film your College Life. The result is an intimate portrayal of the highs and lows of the experience, a no-holds barred, honest portrayal of life on campus. The academic and social pressures they face are real, as is the drama of lives that are being lived in real time. From the excitement of new friendships and new romances to serious bouts of homesickness, the on- and off-campus party scene, the football madness of game day and everything else these students encounter as they get their first real taste of freedom will be seen on episodes of College Life. The emotions are raw and the stories are real because without camera crews, directors or scripts, all that's left is an uncensored look at College Life.",
