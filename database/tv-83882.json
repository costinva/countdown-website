  "overview": "The junior version of the phenomenal Grandmaster puts children in the spotlight! The basic idea of the program is the same as for adults: children compete in tasks created by the Grandmaster that require intelligence, skill and wit. There will be speed and wild situations, as well as downright cutting analysis in the studio. The Grandmaster is rightfully Jaakko Saariluoma, and his right-hand man is judge Pilvi Hämäläinen.",
