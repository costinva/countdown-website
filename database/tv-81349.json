  "overview": "Faces of Evil is a gripping true crime series in which we revisit the nefarious deeds of some of the world's most infamous killers from the UK and America. From relentless serial killers to remorseless child murderers, this series uncovers the evil behind their often unassuming faces.Each episode combines first-hand accounts from detectives who worked on the cases, with expert analysis from a criminologist and a forensic psychologist. As we re-examine the evidence that led to the capture of these dangerous criminals, we're asking the question: could anything have been done differently?",
