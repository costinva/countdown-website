  "overview": "Football fans are notoriously competitiveâ€¦ and not just in stadiums cheering on their teams, but at tailgate parties too. There's always a fight over who makes the best chili, who brought the best wings, whose barbeque beef brisket reigns supreme. Well, now Emeril is going to help one lucky football fan win that fight at his next gathering. Each week on Emeril Tailgates, we will profile a different football-obsessed city and a home team super fan. We'll surprise the fan with a trip to Emeril's New Orleans kitchen to learn a new tailgate dish that will make their friends and family proud.",
