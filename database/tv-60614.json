  "overview": "The Tasmanian town of Deadloch, a once sleepy seaside hamlet, is left reeling when a local man turns up dead on the beach. Two female detectives are thrown together to solve the case, fastidious local Senior Sergeant Dulcie Collins and a rough as guts blow in from Darwin, Senior Investigator Eddie Redcliffe along with their overeager junior constable Abby. As the town prepares to launch the annual arts, food and culture Winter \"Feastival\", the trio has to put their differences aside and work together to find the killer.",
