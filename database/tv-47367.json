In each episode, Kevin invites one of his celebrity friends to join him on a fun, fit journey, trying out unique and outrageous workouts from jousting like a medieval knight to batting practice with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kevin and his friends hilariously push themselves out of their comfort zones on the way to getting fit.",
