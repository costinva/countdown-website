  "overview": "Zhao Chuxi, an orphan, was born in Wanjing Mountain and raised under the care of Li Chengqian, a principal. The deaths of Ping'an and Li Chengqian hit him hard, leading him to decide to honor Li Chengqian's last wishes. Determined to improve conditions in his village and prevent further loss of loved ones due to poor transportation, he leaves the village for Jia City to work for money. Upon arriving in Jia City, Zhao Chuxi remains true to his values despite the temptations of a materialistic world. His kindness and willingness to help others have given his boss, Su Xiluo, a strong sense of security, and she gradually develops feelings for him. However, this has also drawn the resentment and retaliation of Xu Shaoqing. With the support and sacrifices of his friends, Zhao Chuxi manages to escape Jia City and arrives in Sanjiang. Yet, everything he has worked for over the past two years is instantly lost. This turning point, however, becomes a catalyst for his true growth. After overcoming numerous challenges, Zhao Chuxi eventually becomes the chairman of Sanjiang Group. He then returns to Jia City, determined to seek justice for Li Chengqian. Having achieved success and recognition, he finally returns to Phoenix Village to fulfill his original dream and the long-cherished wish of Li Chengqian.",
