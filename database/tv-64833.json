  "overview": "The show \"This is Miniatures\" will bring together duets and trios that work in this genre. Within each episode, several participants will show numbers, and an auditorium of 100 people will put \"likes\" or \"dislikes\". The more votes \"for\" the comedians get, the greater their chances of winning the final prize - 200 thousand rubles. However, in the battle for victory, you need to defeat not only the declared rivals, but also the guest stars who will perform at the end of each issue.",
