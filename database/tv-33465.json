  "overview": "A 10-episode documentary series to trace the history of graffiti: from the beginnings in New York from the 70s until the breakthrough of the virus in Europe in the mid-80s. A dive in the city that saw the movement begin within it, in the Bronx, then a trip to Europe, where the movement spread like wildfire from 1983 in Amsterdam, Paris and London. Then all over the continent.",
