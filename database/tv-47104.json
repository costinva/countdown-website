  "overview": "Alma's Not Normal follows Boltonian wild-child Alma Nuthall and her family of eccentric, unruly women. After a recent break-up, Alma tries to get her life back on track. But with no job, no qualifications and a rebellious streak a mile wide, it's not going to be easy. Meanwhile her mum, who is battling a heroin addiction, has been sectioned for arson, and her vampish Grandma Joan wants nothing to do with it.",
