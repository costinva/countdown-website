  "overview": "None of the operatives voluntarily wanted to go to work in the new district of Vaselkovo, cut off by the \"ring\" of the railway. Four \"downed pilots\" were found in the department: Yegor Ozhogin, who began to drink often after the death of his wife, Anatoly Davydov, whose hussar adventures were not liked by the authorities, Mikhail Belsky, who turned out a successful and profitable operation with medical assistance. They were housed in an old abandoned building of the police department. Now homicide operatives are forced to live and work under the same roof. With the light hand of local residents, this building began to be called the \"House with cops\". But the police themselves are not laughing. How can you not have your own corner? And how many cases do you need to solve in order to get an office apartment?",
