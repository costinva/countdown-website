  "overview": "Set in Victorian-era London, the series follows Detective Inspector Rabbit, a hardened booze-hound who's seen it all, and his new, hapless, by-the-books partner. While they're investigating a local murder, the lewd but insightful adoptive daughter of the chief of police joins them, becoming the country's first female officer. Together, the trio must fight crime while rubbing shoulders with street gangs, crooked politicians, Bulgarian princes, spiritualists, music hall stars and the Elephant Man.",
