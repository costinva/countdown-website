  "overview": "Cave Kids is a 30-minute short-lived animated series and spin-off of The Flintstones, starring Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm. It was produced by Hanna-Barbera for Cartoon Network and aired in 1996. The series followed the adventures of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm as pre-schoolers with Dino, the Flintstones' family dog as their babysitter. Unlike the original Flintstones series and its several spin-off productions featuring the kids and their famous parents, this show focused more on educational values and lessons for children.",
