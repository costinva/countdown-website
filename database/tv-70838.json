  "overview": "David Attenborough explores the extraordinary ways that animals hear and produce sound, and the crucial role sound plays in the lives of animals around the globe - from birth to surviving adulthood and finding a mate. Using cutting-edge recording technology and 360-degree Dolby Atmos soundscapes, this immersive, ground-breaking series places sound centre stage for the first time.We witness how baby caiman communicate with each other from within the egg, how lions and hyaenas battle in the dark using sound, how a strange fish baffled local residents with its eerie hum, and how some birds have mastered the art of mimicry to remarkable effect. Packed with wonder, insight and new scientific discoveries, Secret World of Sound with David Attenborough will transport viewers into an unforgettable experience.",
