  "overview": "The quarantine is over, but the villagers decide not to tell the local hooligans-the Popov brothers. After all, the time of self-isolation was the most peaceful in the entire history of the settlement — crime decreased by 100%. Most of all, this scam is interested in the klutz-the district police officer and the Head of the settlement, dreaming of a promotion. Now every resident of the village plays a role, but everything goes wrong when the younger brother falls in love with the city doctor Galya, who is actually waiting for the groom in the district center.  ",
