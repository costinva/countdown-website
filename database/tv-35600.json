  "overview": "In the new cooking program Kockakademin, ten young chef talents compete for his big dream job: a job as a chef at Johan Jureskog's award-winning restaurant AG in Stockholm. Under the leadership of Jureskog - and with guest invitations of several other star chefs - the contestants get to learn more about the cooking art and stand against each other in tough competitions. In addition, they live together during the racing season in a luxury villa just outside of Stockholm, which gives a wonderful cookie of cooking and reality.",
