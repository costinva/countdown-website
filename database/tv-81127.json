  "overview": "Ran Shuang, who was once the best trader on Wall Street, agreed to marry Fu Zhi Heng in order to repay his financial support. After three years of marriage, the two had not had sex. Ran Shuang thought that Fu Zhi Heng was thinking about his childhood sweetheart Lu Meng Lian. But in fact, it was because Fu Zhi Heng was abused by the nanny when he was a child, and he had a psychological shadow since then and could not have substantial contact with women. After being repeatedly ignored by Fu Zhi Heng, Ran Shuang decided to let go and leave, and Fu Zhi Heng gradually realized his feelings for Ran Shuang and resolutely pursued his wife.",
