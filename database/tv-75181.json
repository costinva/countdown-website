  "overview": "Under former leader Sonny Barger, the Hells Angels \"brotherhood\" expanded across the United States. With continued accusations of criminal activity, the biker club became known as a serious threat and not to be crossed. Secrets of the Hells Angels examines the history of the group of outlaws to uncover the organization's darkest secrets. With access to 5 former chapter presidents including Charles \"PeeWee\" Goldsmith, Thomas Eriksen, Pat Matter, Matt Zanoskar and George Christie alongside exclusive interviews with law enforcement officers, undercover agents, victims and more, it is revealed that the Hells Angels were a much more violent, devious, and highly organized group than anyone realized.",
