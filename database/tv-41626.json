  "overview": "In the first ever celebrity series of SAS: Who Dares Wins, 12 well-known faces embark on one of the toughest tests of their lives, to raise money for Stand Up To Cancer. They're living and surviving together in an unforgiving ex-military base, high in the Chilean Andes. From the recruits' very first challenge - a terrifying backwards dive out of a helicopter - Ant Middleton and his team of ex-special forces instructors are determined to show them that no allowances will be made for their celebrity status.",
