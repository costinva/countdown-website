  "overview": "AWA All-Star Wrestling is a syndicated television series featuring wrestling matches as promoted by the American Wrestling Association (AWA). All-Star Wrestling footage (And AWA footage as a whole) is now owned by World Wrestling Entertainment. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the All-Star Wrestling television series was essentially a one-hour paid advertisement for the AWA's house shows. This meant that third party advertisers were almost nonexistent. In the early 1970s, as wrestling became more popular, national companies such as McDonald's and local companies such as car dealerships bought commercial spots on the shows.",
