  "overview": "Despite the prohibition of her parents, 20-year-old Faina Feldman is going to conquer theatrical Moscow. The capital greets her with hostility, but Faina does not care much, especially since real friends and mentors appear in her life who teach, help, and patronize. Every little success is replaced by a serious life drama. A revolution, then a war... and every time - a serious struggle for life, which rests on a fragile hope, great love for the theater and absolute faith in one's own destiny.",
