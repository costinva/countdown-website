  "overview": "Just Roll With It is an interactive improvisational comedy centered around the blended Bennett-Blatt family and features step-siblings Blair and Owen who could not be more different. Blair, often a rebel without a cause, is the polar opposite of her strict, regimented, ex-military mom Rachel. Owen, a born athlete with a taste for scheduling and organization, is always trying to clean up Byron, his creative and charismatic morning-radio-show-host father. Despite their differences, the Bennett-Blatt clan, and the actors who play them, know how to take whatever life – and the studio audience – throws at them.",
