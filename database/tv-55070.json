  "overview": "Southern California home renovators Carmine Sabatella and Mike Pyle begrudgingly agree on one thing: a beautifully updated home requires great design indoors and out. The series follows Carmine, a real estate agent and interior designer, and Mike, a landscape designer, as they each pitch their design plans to clients. The budget is set, so the guys must be persuasive to score a bigger chunk of the dollars to either max out the interiors or make the most of the outdoor spruce up. More money for Carmine will mean clients get all they want and more for their home's interior, while extra cash for Mike will give the property wow-factor curb appeal and major outdoor living perks. No matter who gets the majority of the renovation budget, both the interior and exterior will get a stunning transformation.",
