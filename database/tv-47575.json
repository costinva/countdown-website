  "overview": "Belgie Scherpgesteld is a documentary series about the way photographers looked at their country and it's inhabitants.We portray them in five thematic films, with their own personal story, motives and emotions. More than artist portraits with accompanying photos, we expose the soul of our country through their eyes and look at our daily life and recent history in an original way.",
