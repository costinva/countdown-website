  "overview": "Punn, a young antique shop owner, is enlisted by his close friend to restore a painting. During the process, Punn accidentally cuts himself on a shard of mirror, staining the artwork with his blood. This act awakens Ramil, the last descendant of a vampire lineage, who has been trapped within the painting for over a century. However, Ramil emerges powerless and becomes the target of relentless pursuit by the \"Hunters.\" Tasked with helping Ramil reclaim his lost powers, Punn embarks on a journey to locate Ramil's former servants. Along the way, a bond gradually forms between the two of them. How will the journey of Punn, Ramil, and the Hunters on the move unfold? Will romance between humans and vampires be possible?",
