  "overview": "It's time for the spookiest hayride imaginable, as Halloween Wars: Hayride of Horror takes the competition out of the kitchen and into the pumpkin patch. Hosted by Harley Morenstein, two teams of master food artists -- working in cake, sugar and a whole lot of carved pumpkin -- face off in three nights of Halloween fright, creating delicious and scary treats and immersive worlds of Halloween horror. In each competition, one team will take home $15,000, but to win it, their creepy displays must win the votes of both a wagon full of hayriders and the judges, renowned pastry chef Zac Young and special effects make-up artist Bianca Appice.",
