The chefs will be hoping to tickle the critics' taste-buds in the hopes of being rewarded with a five star seal of approval.During service, the celebrities will get instant feedback in the kitchen to their menu from remote cameras and microphones covering the dining room.The identity of the celebrities will remain a secret to the diners and the critics until service is over, at which point the celebrity will step out of the kitchen and face the critics in front of the diners to find out their star rating (from 1â€“5).",
