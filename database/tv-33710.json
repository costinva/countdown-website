  "overview": "Launch My Line features ten well-known professionals who are highly regarded in their varied fields of expertise, but have always envisioned having their own clothing line. These professionals, who include a choreographer, a DJ, a CEO and a fashion critic, will be paired with ten established fashion designers who will help them execute their dream clothing line. The ten pairs will be put to the test, as they have to rely on each other's expertise to produce a cohesive fashion line while competing in challenges that include some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry. Some teams form a natural connection while others have instant tension, but at the end of every episode a complete look from each team must walk the runway and be judged in front of a live studio audience. In the end, the winning professional will have their clothing line launched and their expert designer, who helped them along way, will receive $50,000.",
