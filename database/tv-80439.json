Each of them has accumulated many complaints over the years of their family life, which, having reached a critical mass, threaten to destroy the once happy marriage. The heroes will be able to spend several days with those partners who seem ideal to them. Where is it easier to breathe, in the family or in freedom? And is the new relationship as good as it seems at first glance? In order to be objective to the issue of old and new relationships, the function of an arbitrator will be performed by a mediator - professional psychologist Inna Chudinova, who will monitor everything that happens.",
