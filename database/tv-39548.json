  "overview": "This high-energy design show tackles d√©cor-challenged homes across the country and features Scandinavia's most celebrated pair of interior designers, Simon Davies and Tomas Cederlund. After locating a design offender, the \"Lords of Fabulousness\" stage a complete home takeover, kicking out the homeowners and moving in. Simon and Tomas make the house their home --- sleeping in the owners' bed, eating their food, and playing their board games --- as they get to work completely transforming the home's offending rooms with the help of a team of contractors and a fresh new design plan.",
