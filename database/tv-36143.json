  "overview": "The Viennese bakery employee Alexandra Winkler surprisingly inherits a Trakehner stud. Alex grew up with foster parents and, before the will was opened, had thought that her birth parents had died in a traffic accident. Now she not only gets a stud, but also three half siblings: Maximilian, Silvia and Leander. While Alexandra feels a longing for family, she has to learn to defend herself against the hostility of Maximilian and his lover Maggie. At the same time, a sinister family secret is gradually being revealed.",
