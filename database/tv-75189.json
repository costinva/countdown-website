  "overview": "A darkly urban comedy-drama shot without a studio audience or laugh track, the series starred Peter Boyle as a veteran, semi-corrupt cop marking time until retirement, and Andrew Rubin as his naive rookie partner, Officer Willie Smith. Series creator Danny Arnold described the lead character as \"a beat patrolman with thirty years on the force. He's become so completely disillusioned and such a terrible cynic that he's written off the world.\" In recurring roles were DeLane Matthews as streetwalker Lorna, the only person with whom the misanthropic Bash could be even somewhat close; Val Bisoglio as Sgt. Carmine DiSalvo; Michael Cavanaugh as Lt. Pendleton; and Larry Hankin as diner-owner Stu. It was set in the 33rd Precinct in Manhattan, represented via a deliberately theatrical set reminiscent of a stage play.",
