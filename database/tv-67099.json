One day, his team is charged with finding an up-and-coming chef to partner with – to help promote the company. The team settles on Park Ki Hoon, the handsome and talented chef at a wildly popular restaurant.However, there's a big catch: Park Ki Hoon hates alcohol! He refuses to sell alcoholic beverages in his restaurant – and even kicks out customers who try to smuggle liquor into the eatery! When Han Ji Yu arrives at Park Ki Hoon's restaurant to explain the company's plan, the latter refuses. But Han Ji Yu refuses to be put off – and takes a part-time job at the restaurant in a bid to change Park Ki Hoon's mind. As the men start to get to know each other, Park Ki Hoon begins to mellow. And as time passes, they begin to develop feelings for one another. Could love be on the menu?",
