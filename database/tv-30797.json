  "overview": "Even from the school curriculum, everyone knows Mikhail Lermontov not only from the poem \"On the Death of a Poet\" or the poem \"Mtsyri\". But who is hiding behind the glossy image presented on the pages of textbooks and prefaces to multi-volume bibliographies? Who was the great Russian poet and how did he live? A darling of high society and a nobleman, he, in part, repeated the fate of the one about whom he wrote.Tragic duel. Thus ended the life of an ambiguous, still misunderstood and underestimated by his contemporaries, one of the best creators of the 19th century. The authors of the film recreated the last days of the great Russian poet, looked at him from a not entirely \"canonical\" side and showed all the ambiguity of the personality of Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov.",
