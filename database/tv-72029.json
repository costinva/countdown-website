  "overview": "Irene (Argentina), Matthias (Germany), Nabil (Syria), Laila (Israel), and Karima (Angola) all arrive in Rio de Janeiro for different reasons. Each experiences the beauty and chaos of this wonderful city – and each runs into trouble along the way. Fortunately, they meet a unique \"corner cutter\" who helps them work through their dilemmas: Francisco, the quintessential Carioca. In the process, they purge prejudices, open themselves up to new cultures, adopt different perspectives, and become advocates for inclusion and equality. Irene, a staunch atheist, has to navigate religious syncretism in Rio in order to fulfill her mother's dying wish. Matthias, a rigorous and inflexible symphony conductor, discovers that improvisation is a pillar of creativity. Nabil, a refugee, intends to take advantage of the freedoms native to Rio to provide a better life for his family. Laila, who has just been discharged from the army, learns from a young boy that the greatest way to take advantage of life's offerings is to expand one's worldview. Karima, a renowned poet, teaches Rio's elite to be proud of their African roots. In the final episode, it's Francisco who is in need of help: he must employ every ounce of his Carioqueness to determine his future in the city he loves — Rio de Janeiro.",
