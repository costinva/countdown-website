The pair embark on a series of hectic scrapes and near misses, as Elsie commits to help Robert hustle for the money. But with an unhinged gang of debt collectors on their trail, the duo must carry out a series of increasingly serious crimes against a ticking clock while fumbling through their dysfunctional relationship.",
