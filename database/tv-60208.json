  "overview": "Six discordant participants are put through their paces as their voices are transformed from screeching in the shower to singing like a soprano, proving that all of us can hold a tune. The English National Opera's world-class vocal coaches - Nicky Spence, Sarah Pring and Michael Harper - will mentor the would-be singers throughout the process, giving masterclasses on everything from vocal technique to stage presence and setting them a series of musical challenges with the help of singing superstars such as Katherine Jenkins to take their singing to the next level â€“ all in the space of three months.",
