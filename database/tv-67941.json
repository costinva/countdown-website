  "overview": "In With A Shout sees two families battle against each other in a thrilling game with a uniquely challenging twist. With an impressive prize of a whopping £20,000, the contestants will have to answer questions hidden within a montage of moving images.   To win the cash, the contestants will have to shout the answers displayed on TV screens. For every category that they get right they move further up the money ladder but the pressure is on, as the families will have to bank as much cash as possible and avoid crashing out altogether.    With the chance to quadruple their prize pot, the stakes are high for the winning family who will have just 60 seconds to successfully answer questions correctly to turn off the TV's. If they fail to turn off all ten tellies within the timeframe, they walk away with nothing.  ",
