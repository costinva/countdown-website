  "overview": "In the Korean town-inspired city of Pleasantburg live Bossy Bear and Turtle - a pair of besties who are total opposites. While Bossy is loud, energetic, and super committed to his wild ideas, Turtle is calm, thoughtful, and always there to be his voice of reason. Despite their differences, this duo is inseparable, emotionally in sync, and always ready to navigate through hilarious and wacky adventures together.",
