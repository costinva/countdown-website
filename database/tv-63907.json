  "overview": "HGTV Canada designer, Sarah Richardson, heads west to take on her biggest challenge yet, purchasing a dated and drab 5,000-square-foot Bavarian-inspired B&amp;B in Whistler, BC. Audiences will step inside Sarah's life with husband Alex and daughters Robin and Fiona as they travel across the country to transform the property into an efficient and profitable, four-season luxury vacation rental. It's a massive undertaking as Sarah juggles the demands of managing a \"back to the studs\" renovation on the west coast while running her design business in Toronto and raising two kids.",
