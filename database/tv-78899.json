  "overview": "The TV show presents us stories of people looking for love on the Internet. Many of them have quite long relationships, but have never seen the other person in the flesh. The mission of the spies is to be able to bring couples together, but they could come across identities that are real, with others that are lies or people who have more than something to hide.",
