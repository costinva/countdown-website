  "overview": "More and more of the country is portrayed as a nation divided: big cities vs. small towns, diverse demographics vs. rural and white. Welcome to Waverly sets out to break down these divisions and see what happens when people from different races, religions, sexual and gender orientations live and work together in a small town. Enter Waverly, Kansas, where the landscape hasn't changed much in the last 120 years, with a mayor who has held office for the past 16 years and ran unopposed in the last election, 99% of the residents are white, and nearly all identify as heterosexual. How will the town respond when they are introduced to the seven incomers which includes a 24-year-old Muslim politician, a cosmetologist who identifies as gay and Republican, an African-American chef, and a liberal mixologist? How will this eclectic crew react to the citizens of Waverly? With clashing values and personality differences, there is sure to be drama and conflict as well as stereotype-busting comedy, compassion, and some newly found common ground.",
