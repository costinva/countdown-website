  "overview": "The series is based on building some of the weird, fantastical ideas \ninventors have patented over the last century. Once physically realised,\n the flaws in these ideas tend to be humorously obvious and explain the \nideas' lack of commercial success. The team then tries to come up with \nan improved version, thus the \"bending\" part of the title, meeting with \nvarying results.",
