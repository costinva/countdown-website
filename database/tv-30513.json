  "overview": "Six new models are brought to the biggest stage in modeling and viewers follow them from their first test shoot to the runways of New York Fashion Week. Petra Nemcova serves as a mentor and friend to the prospective models as they learn the trade of modeling and the business of fashion. Using her own life experiences, Petra advises the models on how to succeed as a model and underscores the importance of having a well-rounded life. Over the span of several weeks, the six girls live through the harsh business of modeling ranging from finicky photographers and clothing designers to contradicting advice on weight and body image from bookers and nutritionists. Throughout the process, NEXT Modeling evaluates the potential of these fresh faces and ultimately determines how many of the models deserve a contract with the agency at the end of the series.",
