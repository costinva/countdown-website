  "overview": "Vliegende Hollanders will take place in the early days of our commercial aviation. Aircraft manufacturer Anthony Fokker and founder of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Albert Plesman were in no doubt intertwined with each other as aviation pioneers. Although their personalities differed from each other like day and night, they managed to make the Netherlands as one of the important players in the world of aviation.",
