  "overview": "Action! Adventure! Alliteration! It's all waiting for you to explore, so pack your bags and wander with Wenda, Wes and Wu as they take you on wild, weird and wonderfully exciting adventures!Inspired by Margaret Atwood's alliterative children's book series, each one of the 26, eight-and-a-half-minute episodes of \"Wandering Wenda\" is a whimsical, globe-trotting action adventure with the delights of sound, word and letter exploration and the most fun you can have playing with words! Wenda is a \"roll-up-your-sleeves\" kind of girl with a heart as huge as a hippo, and a strong sense of adventure. But her overconfidence often, hilariously, gets her and the gang into trouble. No matter where Wenda wanders, she always seems to find herself mixed up in the middle of mayhem! BUT when the going gets tough, she just uses her words... literally! With some quick wordplay she always manages to get out of even the trickiest situations. Along for the adventures are Wesley Woodchuck and a bookish boy named Wu.Together, the three friends share in the daring exploits of each new travel destination and with a little teamwork (and by playing with words, sounds and letters), there's nothing they can't overcome!",
