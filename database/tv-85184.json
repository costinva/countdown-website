  "overview": "The self-produced series will tell viewers about the history of domestication of the most important species for humans. Goats and sheep, cows and horses, chickens and ducks, dogs and cats – now we cannot imagine our lives without these animals, habitually calling them domestic. But it was not always so! Leading experts – biologists, archaeologists, Assyriologists – will tell about the influence of domestication not only on people's lives, but also on world culture and mythology.",
