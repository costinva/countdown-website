  "overview": "The \"human gourmet love story\" begins when Tomoya Ishida, a rookie editor at a women's magazine who is still unsure of his job environment, is asked by a more experienced colleague to take charge of a regular food column written by an old man named Ayumu Mitsuya. Ishida decides to visit Mitsuya, and upon meeting Mitsuya, he sees him as a charming, witty gentleman with a cute side who can cook a delicious dish. Ishida's interactions with Mitsuya begin to make the younger editor more comfortable in his job, and he begins to see Mitsuya not just as a work partner, but as something else entirely.",
