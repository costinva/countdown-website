  "overview": "Divorced, hectic mother-of-two, Lauren is looking for sex without commitment. With the help of best friend Alex, she develops \"Spreadsheet\": a database of sex options, customised to ensure her sushi train of sex rolls around with variety and order amidst the chaos of her life. What Lauren didn't expect was a slew of needy men, which apparently even a well-managed excel tracker can't control.",
