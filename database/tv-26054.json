  "overview": "Not every film is a big-budget blockbuster from an Oscar-winning director. Many movies are made by little-known filmmakers -- Hollywood outsiders, if you will -- and can fly under the radar of the mainstream media because of the lack of notable names behind them. This series puts some of those forgotten movies under the spotlight. Hosts Evan Husney and Zack Carlson chat with underground filmmakers who have put everything they have into their work only to come up with what some might consider questionable results and movies that aren't of the best quality. The featured movies include martial arts flick \"Miami Connection\" and mutated-bird thriller \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\".",
