  "overview": "This is the toughest building competition on television – to see who can build the best deck in an unbelievably restricted amount of time. Just two days. It is high-level-construction packed into a pressure cooker of time, expectations and know-how. There are two teams, each made up of two people. The prize is a hugely awesome trophy plus victory itself – knowing that they competed and conquered in a construction contest.",
