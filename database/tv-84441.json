  "overview": "In the greed-fueled landscape of 1980s Los Angeles, a group of young, ambitious men set out to make their fortune—but their lavish dreams quickly spiral into a web of deception, fraud, and murder. Produced by Universal Television Alternative Studio (UTAS), Billionaire Boys Club unpacks the rise and fall of Joe Hunt and the exclusive investment group comprised of privileged 20-somethings whose schemes and crimes led to murder and captivated the media. In an era where fraud and deception have become status quo, Billionaire Boys Club serves as a chilling cautionary tale—revealing what happens when ambition becomes obsession, and a mansion-sized empire is nothing more than a house of cards waiting to collapse. ",
