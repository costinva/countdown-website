  "overview": "Smoggie Queens is an out and out comedy centred around a gang of friends who are fiercely proud of their North Eastern town of Middlesbrough and their small pocket of the LGBTQ+ community.Smoggie Queens tells the story of volatile Dickie along with drag queen Mam, self-styled hun Lucinda, awkward Sal and newcomer Stewart as they navigate love, life and their pride for a town that feels neglected in its own little corner of the UK. It's an underdog story on two fronts, so expect a few passionate scraps that may send your wig flying!",
