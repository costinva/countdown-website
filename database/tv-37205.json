  "overview": "Grandpa's invention accidentally shrinks both Zak and Grandpa down to the size of insects. With the aid of one bionic arm and three ‘enhanced' insect friends – Syd, Chowser and Willow, they are the Insectibles and find themselves facing challenges beyond their wildest dreams. They bravely trek through grass blade forests and fight the evil mecha-mosquito Adilla with her daughter, Lidia, her faithful servant Gnat and a whole platoon of bodybuilding cockroaches. Can Zak and Grandpa find the parts needed to un-shrink themselves before Adilla gets to them?",
