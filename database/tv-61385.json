Then, however, men appeared who tried to revive Gyumaoh, the Great Yokai who was slain by the war god Nataku Taishi and buried in Houtou Castle 500 years ago, by using a forbidden combination of chemistry and magic The negative energy waves this created spread across Togenkyo, causing the yokai to go insane and attack humanity.
