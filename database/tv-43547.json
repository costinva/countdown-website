  "overview": "Veronica hosts a midnight radio show called The Best Sex Ever. Each night \"after all the good girls and boys have gone to bed\", she invites listeners to call in and share their own personal erotic tale about \"the best sex you ever had\". In each episode Veronica suggests a theme for that night's show, and one caller's story is presented, with Veronica occasionally interjecting comments or questions.",
