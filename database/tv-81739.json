  "overview": "An international conspiracy is brewing by a number of countries that want to discredit Russia, accuse it of environmental crimes in the polar zone, such as testing chemical and other weapons, and deprive it of access to the Arctic. For this purpose, a daring series of sabotage is planned: the seizure of a nuclear icebreaker, the undermining of the ice floe on which the Russian scientific station North Pole operates, the mining and capture by sabotage divers of a secret underwater facility, an attack on ice-class tankers and much more.",
