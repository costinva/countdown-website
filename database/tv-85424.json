  "overview": "Halva Malmö består av killar som dumpat mig follows 31-year-old Amanda during a summer of intense dating. She desperately craves to be loved and decides to try it all. She dates all kinds of people, swipes on dating apps, and picks up guys in bars. She is submissive and dominating, but stays abandoned. She even has a hard time getting to second base, a second date. The same thing goes for Amandas' friends. Together, they try to find new dates for each other while debating those big questions: Why is it so hard to find love? How much can the world really require from a person? And how many times can you venture into the world with your heart on your sleeve only to have it stepped on once again?",
