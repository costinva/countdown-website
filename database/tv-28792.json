  "overview": "On Altar'd, the wedding day is fast approaching, but for these couples one big change is needed before they say \"I do\": they need to lose weight. There's just one big catch: They must agree to get fit solo. Will losing weight apart keep these couples together forever? Watch each week as a different bride- and groom-to-be pair up with pro trainers to undergo inspiring 90-day transformations that won't be revealed until each couple sees each other again...walking down the aisle to the altar.",
