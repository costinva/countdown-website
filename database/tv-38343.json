  "overview": "Combining his passion for baking, biking and movies, Paul journeys across the continent on a Harley Davidson before he arrives in the ultimate movie mecca, Hollywood. Paul's 3000-mile tour takes in culinary locations inspired by some of the most iconic films. In Los Angeles, Paul samples the burgers in Bob's Big Boy Diner, which appears in Pulp Fiction, and in New York it's pizza in Lenny's Pizzeria, well-known to film fans for Saturday Night Fever. Paul tries his hand at making a Honey Tart, a sweet dessert native to New Orleans and Cowboy Coffee Cake in New Mexico. Famous friends join Paul along the way for a slice of pie and a $5 shake.",
