Every Monday in the four weeks leading up to the Game of Thrones finale season, show hosts will recap, dissect and rejoice in the last seven seasons of Game of Thrones, immersing themselves in all things GoT.With the start of GoT last season, the series will transform into a live aftershow, Thrones 360: LIVE, filmed in front of a live studio audience and immediately following the broadcast of each new episode of Game of Thrones. Each week, celebrity guests and GoT experts in the studio will help the hosts analyse that day's Game of Thrones episode, by discussing key plot details and moments the audience may have missed and speculating on future storylines.",
