  "overview": "Tony Award-winning actor James Monroe Iglehart will host Biggest Little Christmas Showdown—a four-part \"mini-sized\" holiday house tournament-style series. James will lead the nation's best miniaturists as they face-off to create the merriest mini holiday houses, complete with all the festive, tiny trimmings. Each week, only one team will wow the spirited panel of judges, including designer Genevieve Gorder and miniatures experts June Clinkscales and Dave Asling, to advance to the next round of this cheerful competition. In the final round, the top contenders will craft their most extravagant mini holiday houses ever for a chance at the ultimate victory: a grand prize worth $50,000 and the surprise of a lifetime when their winning miniature is super-sized into a magical vacation home decked out for the season.",
