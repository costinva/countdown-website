  "overview": "An eco-friendly challenge series where contestants are presented with a box of mystery items to cut, sew, stitch, hammer, burn, tear, and do whatever's necessary to create a brand-new product. From taking discarded denim jeans and making them into a new functional jacket, to repurposing old Oreo bags into a new couture handbag, one man's trash will be upcycled into a treasure.",
