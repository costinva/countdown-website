  "overview": "Ten years have passed, and he thought he'd forgotten about his first love. One day, he comes across his first love. Kang Hu-young is tall, handsome, and intelligent, and has lived a carefree life. When he came back to Korea from the US after ten years, he coincidentally ran into his first love. It brought back the memory from the past, making his heart race again... But unlike Hu-young, Lee Hong-ju is living an ordinary life. She believes a romantic relationship is a luxury and love is a waste of energy. She tries to stay away from him, but somehow, her heart starts to flutter as well. Is it just a serendipitous encounter? Or is it fate?",
