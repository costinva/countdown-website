  "overview": "Funny, charming, and sarcastic Mueang is a 27-year-old outspoken eco-warrior geologist who enjoys tree-hugging as a pastime. While Apo/View is a 27-year-old architect who wears her heart on her sleeve, is overworked and recently dumped by her company, and goes on the deep end when her boyfriend cheats on her. Cupid strikes the moment Mueang and View set eyes on each other, sparks fly... one innocent conversation leads to another, and they unexpectedly spend the night together. Their overnight rendezvous in a cozy camper by the sea was chaotically unforgettable. But the following day, when Mueang gets up, he finds that Apo had left without leaving any details of her contact or whereabouts.Â ",
