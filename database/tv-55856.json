  "overview": "Any Muslim who decides to live in Belgium saddles their relatives with a delicate dilemma. Do we get buried here or in our country of origin? The young IsmaÃ«l 'Smile' Boulasmoum, who inherited the repatriation company of his father together with his sister, has a solution: what if we import soil from Morocco to bury our dead? We'll start a soil business! Without realizing it, they've opened Pandora's box.",
