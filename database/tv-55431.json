  "overview": "After being invited to perform in Australia and New Zealand, Russell takes a trip to explore these distant lands where Covid has been kerbed. Following two weeks in quarantine to gain access, Russell travels the length and breadth of New Zealand, throwing himself headfirst into everything from Manu divebombing to championship sheep shearing, underwater driving to Mauri hot pool cooking. He'll meet legendary kiwi Sam Neill, famous first-man Clarke Gayford, comedian Urzila Carlson and the wonderful old age woodworkers of Coffin Club.Then Russell heads across the sea to Australia, where he cooks shrimps on the barbie with Tim Minchin, meets real life mermaids and gets up close and personal with Koalas in the care of Robert Irwin, son of the Aussie zoo legend Steve Irwin.  He also faces his fears up close and personal with sharks and races toilets in an Aussie pub tradition.",
