  "overview": "One day, Earth's God of Destiny, and Galdardia's Chief God had a bet. The God of Destiny lost, and chose ten mediocre souls to hand over. To those ten souls, the Chief God of Galdardia handed them new vessels. Among those mediocre souls was one salaryman who fought against his destiny of death. How will this man grow from now on? Not the God of Destiny, nor the Chief God of Galdardia, nor even the author themselves know.",
