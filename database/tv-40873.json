  "overview": "neXt is a propulsive thriller set in the A.I. research world. It features a brilliant but paranoid former tech CEO who joins a Homeland Cybersecurity Agent and her team to stop the world's first artificial intelligence crisis: the emergence of a rogue AI with the ability to continuously improve itself. Marrying pulse-pounding action with a layered examination of how technology is invading our lives and transforming us in ways we don't yet understand, the series also presents us with a villain like we've never seen before, one whose greatest weapon against us is ourselves.",
