  "overview": "Beacon 23 follows Aster, a government agent, and Halan, a stoic ex-military man, who cross paths when they end up trapped together inside one of the many Beacons in outer space that serve as a lighthouse for intergalactic travelers. Every Beacon is run by one highly trained human and a specialized Artificial Intelligence. Aster mysteriously finds her way to the lonely Beacon-keeper Halan, and a tense battle of wills unfolds. Halan begins to question whether Aster is friend or foe, as her ability to disguise her agenda and motives could make her a formidable opponent.",
