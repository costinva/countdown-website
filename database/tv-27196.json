  "overview": "Le grand journal is a French nightly news and talk show airing every weekday evening from 19:10 to 20:20 on Canal+. It debuted on August 30, 2004 and was created and hosted by Michel Denisot. Then hosted by Antoine de Caunes. Then hosted by Ma√Øtena Biraben. Since 2016, it is hosted by Victor Robert. Originally a one-hour program, it expanded to two hours in 2005. Even though the show is broadcast on the premium channel Canal+, this is a non-encrypted program. Created in 2004 by producer-director Renaud Le Van Kim, the show was originally composed of one block broadcast from 19:05 to 19:55, usually live except on Fridays. The show benefitted from audiences from all of Canal+'s free time slots watching, in addition to the extension of Digital terrestrial television, which allowed new households access to the channel.",
