  "overview": "Scotland's best-known outdoors man, Cameron McNeish, journeys up the western seaboard from the Mull of Kintyre to Mallaig. Travelling on foot, by bike, by pack-raft and with his beloved campervan, his journey takes him over 200 miles through some of our most impressive wild places. Along the way, he meets an artist, a storyteller and a ghillie. And most surprisingly of all he discovers how our ancestors created their music.",
