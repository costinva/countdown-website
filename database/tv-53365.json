  "overview": "Dating No Filter is a take on modern dating. The UK version of this hit US format sees a group of singletons sent on blind dates, set up by quick-witted comedians. The comics will be given some control over a diverse range of matches and will then watch and weigh in on the dates, giving \"hysterically unfiltered commentary on every awkward interaction and heart-warming moment.\" But what they are really rooting for is for love to conquer all!",
