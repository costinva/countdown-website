  "overview": "Join Bernie and Leepu are in the main men in Chop Shop: London Garage. The garage is situated smack bang in the middle of Britain's largest Bangladeshi community, Brick Lane. It's the ideal place for Leepu's design visions to mix with Bernie's East End mechanical skills. Bernie deals with the practicalities of transforming bangers into blingers, whilst Leepu spearheads the creativity behind the cars. However, Leepu's ambitious design visions threaten Bernie's sanity and also the future of the garage. Will British and Bangladeshi cultures clash when they create motor mayhem?",
