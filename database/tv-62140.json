  "overview": "Tolga is a young actor at the peak of his fame but unsatisfied, while Asya is a clerk working in a shopping mall who dreams of studying at university. When the paths of these two young people, who see life as different as black and white, cross as a result of coincidences, two different worlds collide with each other. While Asya suddenly finds herself in a life that she is not interested in, Tolga, the dreamy crush of many young girls, will pay a heavy price for underestimating Asya.",
