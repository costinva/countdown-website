The country is in turmoil when it appears that Prince Bernhard has actually accepted a bribe. Juliana threatens to resign. The monarchy is faltering. When senior soldiers start to interfere in solidarity with the Prince and also ask the people for openness, Den Uyl can no longer postpone his decision. Does he choose to preserve the monarchy or not? A political thriller and a royal drama.",
