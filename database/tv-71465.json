  "overview": "Bugs that Rule the World takes viewers on an unprecedented, eye-popping journey into the incredible world of insects, to unravel the mysterious lives of these tiny creatures that make up 90% of life on Earth and explore the critical roles insects play in maintaining the planet. The incredible diversity of their bodies, sex lives, societies and migrations reveal that, although insects seem to always be buzzing around us, we hardly know our fellow earthlings at all. The series sets out on a cinematic adventure to remote jungles, deserts and savannas with a crew of scientists and follows them to the lab, where they use cutting-edge science to examine the secrets of how and why insects do what they do.",
