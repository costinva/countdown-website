  "overview": "Multi-award-winning Māori musician and actor Troy Kingi is up to his eighth album in his ambitious 10/10/10 mission, where he aims to record 10 albums in 10 genres in 10 years.However, for the past few years, writer's block has caused Troy's creative river to run dry.In the hopes of sourcing some much-needed inspiration for his upcoming desert-rock album (a first-love genre for him), Troy makes the journey from Kerikeri to Joshua Tree to fulfil a lifelong dream of recording at one of the most iconic music studios in the world, Rancho De La Luna.With the ambitious schedule of writing and recording an entire album in just 10 days, Troy and his band need to dig deep. Luckily for them, the Joshua Tree desert is filled with lots of interesting and eccentric locals who are more than happy to help Troy and the band get inspired.Desert Hīkoi isn't just a music documentary; it's the journey of a group of artists finding their richest vein of creativity, whilst going deep within and learning about themselves.",
