  "overview": "The most ordinary at first glance, the provincial town of Veliky Guslyar is, in fact, a unique point on the planet Earth, where communication with parallel worlds and civilizations of other planets is open. Time travel, teleportation, talking animals and flying saucer parking are commonplace for the locals. The Guslyars are so accustomed to them that they practically do not notice.",
