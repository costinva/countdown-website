  "overview": "One day, a woman from the past appears in the life of Moscow lawyer Mikhail – his first love, the daughter of a gypsy baron, Diana. She asks for help in releasing their daughter Yana from prison in exchange for keeping Mikhail's secret, because he is pretending to be someone else. In fact, he is a gypsy named Mihai Demetre, who was expelled from the camp 16 years ago. Mihai returns to the camp where he grew up to save the daughter he never knew existed and to face his past.",
