  "overview": "Taeyi hears a familiar melody fill the empty halls and makes his way to the old music room. He knows his brother is dead, but he can't help but hope, maybe, just maybe…it's his brother playing his favorite song. When he slams open the door, however, he finds Seheon, the new transfer student, at the piano. Disappointment comes crashing down and Taeyi can't control his anger. How dare Seheon play his brother's song? How dare he smile? How dare he say he loves jazz? \"If I ever catch you playing the piano again…that'll be the end of you.\" And with that begins Taeyi and Seheon's story, as unpredictable and visceral as jazz.",
