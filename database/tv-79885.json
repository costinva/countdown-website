  "overview": "Many years ago, a tragedy occurred in Vera's family - an unknown person kidnapped her little daughter Katya and demanded a ransom, but had no intention of returning the baby alive. Since then, the woman has not been able to recover - she celebrates her daughter's birthday every year, and even created a photo with the help of artificial intelligence of what Katya would look like now, at 18 years old. Pyotr, Vera's husband, considers all this a meaningless ritual, and for a long time now he and his wife have only been connected by their common business. Despite everything, Vera hopes for a miracle that will return her Katya, and suddenly she sees a girl on the street who seems to have stepped out of that very photo.",
