  "overview": "What do Maria Cantemir, Maria Menshikova, daughter of Peter I Anna and Natalya Lopukhina have in common? They found themselves hostages to their fate, pawns in a man's game.They shone in salons and at social events, they were applauded by theatergoers, courtiers were afraid of them... But how little we know about the role of women in Russian history. The series of programs \"Prisoners of Fate\" tells about famous women of the 17th-19th centuries, famous, intelligent, often very rich and wayward, and how their lives turned out.",
