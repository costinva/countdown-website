  "overview": "Years ago, Shen Qingru's mother was drowned for adultery by the clan leader. Branded as the daughter of a \"fallen woman,\" Qingru grew up numb and tormented under the town's scorn, carrying the weight of her mother's tragic fate. Then came Shen Cheng—the \"mute\" boy who became both her salvation and her greatest weakness. Their bond blurred the fragile line of \"siblings,\" yet the world's gaze kept it firmly in place. Under watchful eyes, Qingru swore with tears that she would never fall in love. Forced into marriage to bring luck to the ailing Mo family heir, Qingru was left widowed the night before the wedding. The Mo matriarch demanded she be buried with him. Meanwhile, Shen Cheng was lured into a deadly trap. To save him, Qingru married the seemingly \"gentle\" son of the clan leader. Left for dead in a mass grave, Shen Cheng miraculously survived. Years later, the once \"mute and rugged\" young man returned as a cold and powerful marshal, hiding his true identity as he stepped back into the town—only for her.",
