  "overview": "The current hype about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as millions are made and lost make for great headlines, but misses the far more interesting story about the technology that allows them to exist, namely, blockchain. This series dives into the cryptokingdom to understand the technology and why we should all care about how it develops. Just as it's difficult to do anything without the internet today, in 10 years, we might very well be saying the same thing about blockchain.The series travels through a landscape where the virtual and the physical intertwine, where seemingly abstract concepts like bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain have inspired libertarians, financiers and entrepreneurs to throw themselves into the technology and explore its potential for the future. Some see it as a revolution, others see the prospect of great profits, and many get lost in between - prey to scams, hacks, or naivet√©. We travel across Latin America and Asia in search of the truth behind the hype.",
