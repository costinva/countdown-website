  "overview": "From the pages of the memoir of Rati, an orphan born of a commoner who has been adopted by an aristocrat, who returns to Siam for the first time in 20 years as an interpreter for the French ambassador. There, he meets Theeratorn, a marquis in the Ministry of Education. Their love at first sight turns into companionship, which then turns into love. But this love blooms among various constraints and conflicts of its time. Just like the taboo of social differences between Mek, a lowly commoner, and Baronnet Dech which threatens their budding friendship. Does true love pull through everything?",
