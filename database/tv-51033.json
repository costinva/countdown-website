  "overview": "In the 20th anniversary year of the hit show, Location, Location, Location: 20 Years and Counting will bring together some of our most memorable stories from the past offering up the social history, from bust to boom and back, of house buying in Britain over a generation. Each episode will explore a theme, from the toughest markets over the years and the times people have questioned whether it's a good time to buy a property, to million-pound homes and first-time buying.Punctuating some of our top home search stories, there will be new stats, giving rundowns on how buying property has changed over the years. Crucially though, each programme will be naturally filled with the energy and tone we've come to know and love from the series. Lots of lovely properties, lots of tricky searches and lots of fun from Kirstie and Phil.",
