  "overview": "In 72 B.C., a time when the Roman Empire's brutal force was far-reaching, each conquered country meant new slaves to do the bidding of their Roman masters. Sold into slavery as a young boy after witnessing his father's murder, Spartacus eventually grew up to lead a slave revolt against Rome's powerful generals and politicians. The profound impact of Spartacus' challenge to the Roman Empire in the name of freedom was felt for years to come.",
