  "overview": "My name is Fredrik Boltes and I have yo-yo dieted all my life. I have tried every diet method out there but still weigh over 160 kilos and find it difficult to live a normal life with my son. In the end I decide to do gastric bypass surgery, but how dangerous is gastric bypass surgery? Can't I lose weight in other ways? What will life be like after the operation? And who the hell pays for the party? For eight years, friends and colleagues filmed me before, during and after the operation. The result is a dead-serious half-baked documentary series. There will be reggae, satire, hard-cut expert interviews, stand-up and a dose of mushrooms under the scrotum. Welcome to my thick documentary.",
