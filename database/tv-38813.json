  "overview": "In Special Ops Mission, viewers are immersed in a diverse set of simulated scenarios to experience firsthand all of the danger, excitement and heart-pounding action of real-life special operations. In each episode, special forces operator Wil Willis must complete a nearly impossible mission using his military expertise spanning over 15 years in special operations with both the U.S. Army Rangers and the U.S. Air Force Pararescuemen. With audiences watching every move, his task is to complete a complex series of military objectives while trying to survive, evade and escape an Opposition Force that is determined to stop him. Each episode introduces Willis to a new mission--ranging anywhere from infiltrating a terrorist camp high in the mountains, making his way through an enemy stronghold in an urban environment, or even climbing aboard a moored ship overtaken by pirates - and a new \"Op For\" team whose only objective is to stop Willis.The closest most viewers will ever get to experience a genuine covert operation, Special Ops Mission tracks Willis as he tests his marksmanship, instincts and military skills throughout these dramatic scenarios.",
