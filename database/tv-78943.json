  "overview": "Solving life's big problems requires the duration of a commercial flight. High in the air, stewardess Dagmar Croner (Johanna von Koczian) addresses the concerns of her passengers and colleagues and saves marriages, tracks down misdirected luggage, assists at a birth and helps a child of divorce to decide between father and mother. In between, she still has time to pass a test that will make her cabin boss. The passengers, but also the on-board staff, change from episode to episode. Monika Schloss (Isolde Miler), Alice Petaud (Evelyn Gressmann), Ilse Flemming (Monika Berg), Maria Gandlberger (Barbara Sch√∂ne) and Yukiko (Francisca Tu) appear several times. Herbert Tiede and Peter Carsten each played a flight captain in two episodes, but a different one each time.",
