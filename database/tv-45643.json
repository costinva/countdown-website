  "overview": "A body can be a temple, but temples can be desecrated. A bodybuilder's flawless physique could spark murderous jealousy, insecurity or rage in others. Egos powerful enough to sculpt chiseled biceps and washboard abs are certainly strong enough to plot murder. Killer Bods chronicles the actual murder cases surrounding America's fitness revolution. Each story has more twists and turns than a Pilates class. Never has true crime looked so stunning at first glance, but so dark just below the surface.",
