  "overview": "Seventeen is the new thirty. Forty is the new twenty five. Parenthood is dead, and city life was not meant for teenagers. Euphoria portrays a sexy, troubling, and bold profile of the teens of the nineties, within a raging drama going on behind teenagers' closed doors. In a visual cinematic dialogue reminiscent of Elephant or Kids, whirling with dialogues like those in Trainspotting, Euphoria presents the impossibilities of age, through tumultuous love stories and suspense.",
