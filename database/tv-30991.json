  "overview": "Born to Kill? Class of Evil is a new twist on the globally successful \"Born To Kill?\" series, delving into six new cases, drawing comparisons between them and some of the most notorious serial killers in history.Not all serial killers are the same, but many share twisted desires and use similarly devious methods to get their perverse kicks. Just as many serial killers have a victim type, so there are types of murderers; from the handsome charmers, who could seduce any woman in the blink of an eye, but can't be satisfied unless they kill, to the power hungry sadists for whom there's no pleasure without pain. Six new cases are explored and each episode is filled with mystery, emotion and the signature suspenseful storytelling.",
