She wished a wish on her birthday. But in the subsequent five years that followed, she lost everything. Commissioner Sinan never left Zeynep's side, and as a result of his great love for her, he lost his job. Zeynep tried one last way to get back what she lost, and hand-in-hand with Sinan, they stubbornly took back everything she lost, one after one.",
