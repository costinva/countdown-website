As Aditi develops an unusual kinship with the deceased, she inevitably risks everything to obtain justice for - her profession, family, and, most importantly, herself. Will she be able to break free from the shadows of her past or will they catch up with her? What appeared to be a simple matter has turned into a controversy that should be shrouded in secrecy. How does a small-town cop cope with a world that doesn't belong to her, or does it?",
