  "overview": "Designer Genevieve Gorder takes on her biggest project yet, renovating her own New York apartment for her and her daughter, Bebelle. Follow along as she breaks down the walls next door to transform her tiny 1850's apartment into a fabulous space. But prime New York real estate always comes at a price, and the apartment next door has been untouched for 40 years which means this design challenge will be her toughest ever. From rotted floors, to construction delays and materials too big for her small stairways, can she succeed all while living out of a suitcase?",
