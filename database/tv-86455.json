  "overview": "Nick Knowles returns to 5 for a truly spectacular adventure, this time in the most desolate place on earth - the Gobi Desert.At five times the size of the UK, with the smallest population on earth, Mongolia is vast and remote and the stunning wilderness of the Gobi covers a third of the country.As Nick discovers, the land of Genghis Kahn and dinosaurs is not only steeped in rich traditions but is also home to some of the most warm-hearted people in the world.From a horse academy keeping alive the remarkable horseback archery skills of the Kahn's warrior hoard to a bout of Mongolian wrestling, followed by a visit to a shaman, this adventure both moved and fascinated Nick beyond expectation.",
