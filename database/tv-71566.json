Zeyrek (Kemal Zeydan) and Çeyrek (Serhan Ernak), who are officers in the police station, live in the mansion of their mother-in-law Saadet (Mine Teber) and are happy with their lives. Zeyrek and Çeyrek are not brilliant officers. Their superiors do not care about this situation any more so, he gives easy works to them to do. Sometimes he even assigns them to different jobs. Despite everything, Zeyrek and Çeyrek love their professions. Further, despite their mother-in-law's acts, they love their families. Finally, Saadet has a more important task than dealing with them. But their happiness does not last long. Because of their brothers, Meftun (Ismail Hacioglu), who they thought they lost their tracks, Meftun is now a matter of knitting socks for everyone.",
