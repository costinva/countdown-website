  "overview": "Xia Ling, is a fresh graduate out of college and looking for jobs. When she receives a text message for an interview late at night at a street called Rakshasa, she rushes out, and belatedly realizes how weird it is for a company to interview so late. It's too late now and she has crossed into a transitional dimension, the bridge between the human ream and hell, where spirits are kept until they are sanctioned. There are many streets like this and each street has a guardian general, guarding the place. At Rakshasa Street, it's the turf of two brothers â€“ Cao Yan Bing (older) and Cao Xuan Liang, presumably are descendants of Cao Cao. In this world full of evil spirits, can you cooperate with your guardian spirit in order to survive?",
