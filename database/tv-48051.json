  "overview": "In a brand new series for ITV, Grow Your Own at Home with Alan Titchmarsh sees the much-loved gardener share insider tips and tricks on growing your own fruit and vegetables at home. Filmed by his wife Alison while in lockdown, this series sees Alan show viewers how to enjoy the benefits of producing their own food no matter what size garden they have; be it outside space, a balcony or room for a single pot. Plus, holed up in their own very different gardens, the Love Your Garden team - David Domoney, Katie Rushworth and Frances Tophill - are also working on their own plots to turn them into productive gardens. Whether that's creating a veg patch from scratch, a tiny edible terraced garden or making an indoor pizza-themed herb garden for the kitchen. These sequences will be interspersed with archive footage revealing Alan's experiences of veg gardens, including inspirational growers and stunning gardens from across the country over the past ten years. Where possible the team will be working in real time so the audience can start working on their new gardens at the same time. With health and food supply high on the agenda it's the perfect time to grow your own. ",
