  "overview": "Flipped centers around chronically underemployed couple Jann and Cricket Melfi, self-proclaimed home renovation \"experts\" who are more than confident they are television's next great home design celebrity duo. Flipped follows the clueless pair as their dreams of basic cable fame and glory are derailed when they get themselves kidnapped by members of a drug cartel, and are forced to renovate their sprawling homes.",
