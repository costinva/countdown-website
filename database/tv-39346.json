Each one-hour episode tells a gripping story of how the most audacious murder, robbery and kidnapping cases were solved, while also interweaving the bizarre, you-can't-make-this-stuff-up stories of the actual people who planned and executed them. Filled with magnetic, deceitful characters and hair-raising plot twists; each real-life case unfolds like great pulp fiction.",
