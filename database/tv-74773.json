Five ordinary yet passionate young people—Mu Dai, Luo Ren, Thirteen-Thousand, Yan Hongsha, and Cao Yanhua—are successively drawn into this crisis through their own fateful encounters. They form the \"Phoenix Squad\" and embark on a perilous quest to subdue these ill omens. Amid life-and-death trials, Luo Ren and Mu Dai heal each other's wounds and forge a genuine bond. Through a long and arduous journey fraught with danger, the five overcome relentless challenges, their friendship tempered and deepened in the fires of adversity.",
