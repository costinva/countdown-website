  "overview": "Anders and Lise are married, in their 30s, love each other and have a wonderful daughter. But when they've been together for seven years, everyday life starts affecting them both in earnest, and they end up on the verge of divorce. Through flashbacks told from the office of the couples' counsellor, we experience Anders and Lise's relationship over the course of the past seven years. The two of them are forced to laugh and cry their way through the ups and downs of their relationship; intense ups of passion, romance and adventure, but also downs of affairs, jealousy, disappointments and endless misunderstandings. Will the counselling help them and can they stomach hearing the truth – allowing love to return to their relationship?",
