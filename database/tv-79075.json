  "overview": "The year is 1993. The UK and Ireland are swept up in electrifying boy band mania. Across Dublin's clubs, bars and schools, a feverish hunt begins, to find the next musical sensation. In the era before tv talent shows ruled, hundreds vied for stardom, but only five working-class Dubliners would have the luck to be plucked from obscurity and be thrust into the global spotlight. It's here, we begin our story.For the first time in 30 years, band members Ronan Keating, Keith Duffy, Shane Lynch and Michael Graham grant rare and exclusive interview access for this three-part Sky documentary series Boyzone: No Matter What.  Revealing their personal experiences in a band that sold over 25 million records worldwide, the boys also talk candidly about how they grappled with the true cost of global fame. And to try and help close a chapter in their lives, they confront the strained relationships and tragic events that have had a lasting impact on all their lives, families and friendships.",
