  "overview": "Fixer to Fabulous: Italiano will document the Marrs, who first visited Italy as newlyweds, as they execute a monumental restoration of the centuries-old property. Inspired by the rich history, rolling hillsides and leafy olive groves of the region, Dave and Jenny will rely on the help of local builders, architects and artisans to meet historic building regulations and source authentic materials such as handmade terracotta tiles, olive wood floors and Carrara marble. Bringing this behemoth renovation across the finish line will take all the grit, determination and building savvy they can muster to overcome language barriers, months of delays, budget restraints, looming deadlines and an immense amount of pressure.Â ",
