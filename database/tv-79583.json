The 2 Johnnies are on the up. With all the success, they have had in Ireland it's time for the lads to make their way in the world and now they embark of their first tour of America. This series follows them as they navigate their first US tour and look at the current state of Irishness in America from the multigenerational \"Irish\" to the recent arrivals, asking the question 'what is IRISH AMERICAN in Trump's America? The lads also get to meet some amazing Americans doing weird and wonderful things.
