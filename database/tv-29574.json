  "overview": "Lars is eleven years old and a half-zombie, or \"living unliving\" as the politically correct term goes. In his new hometown, Lars's kind are rare and frowned upon. But, he soon discovers others who are different too: a ninja, a witch, a troll and a changeling, to mention some. Together, they explore their true nature in a conformist and deeply prejudiced society.",
