  "overview": "After Austin Ellis, off-grid tech wiz and self proclaimed 'reality-theorist' receives a package in the mail, he is sent on a journey to find his AWOL parents before vaccine mogul, Delilah Green forces their return. Austin tries to calm his anxiety through weekly therapy sessions with Dr. Charlotte Walker, who doesn't always see eye to eye. With the aid of his best friend, Kat Frederick, a modern day Robin Hood, Austin navigates this new world where cash is obsolete and Indemnity Points are the only form of currency.",
