  "overview": "I Hate You is a comedy about best friends. Two best friends in their 20s and their intense, messy friendship in today's intense, complicated world.It's about the one friend you can say anything to and do anything with: the idiotic in-jokes, and the laughing till you almost puke, as well as the insane bickering and late-night shouting matches.It's about that one friend you really love - and really hate.Charlie's a bit of a worrier, who thinks 99% of humans are d*ckheads, and Becca - no embarrassment gene, usually makes the wrong decision. Together they share a flat that is half spotless (Becca's room) and half 'sh*ttery' (Charlie's room). Together they're complete chaos...The first series sees Charlie get arrested for pick-pocketing a police officer, Becca learns the perils of jogging to jazz, the girls meet a man who believes humans came from bears, and both start dating older guys - more specifically - men in their seventies. All this plus a Lord who keeps a fly as his pet.",
