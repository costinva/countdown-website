  "overview": "Nakia follows full-blooded Navajo Nakia Parker, a deputy sheriff in the fictional town of Concord in fictional Davis County in 1974 New Mexico. Nakia balances ancient tribal customs and the use of modern police methods which occasionally leads to opposition from his more narrow-minded white neighbors--including his boss, Sheriff Jericho.",
