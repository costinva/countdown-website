  "overview": "Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of a major international airport or show-stopping Las Vegas performance? Find out as brand new series, Nerve Center goes behind the scenes to reveal what it takes to operate and manage some of the biggest, most complex industrial hubs that humanity has ever built. Revealing the inner workings of core infrastructures such as Grand Central Terminal and the Panama Canal, this fascinating series profiles the people, processes and high-tech machines needed to ensure everything runs with military precision. The stakes are high; if just one of these systems fails, or someone fails to do their job, hundreds and sometimes thousands of people could die. Explore the intricacies of these hot spots through the eyes and experiences of those who work there as they reveal the importance of systems that are often taken for granted.",
