  "overview": "The Luangwa Valley in Zambia is one of Africa's last great wildernesses. A rich mosaic of ebony forests and grassy plains, it's home to a vast array of colourful species including carmine-bee-eaters, hyenas, lions, vultures, crocodiles and insects such as praying mantis. This series follows the challenges the valley's wildlife must overcome during the long dry season as they await the life-giving rains.",
