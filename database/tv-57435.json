  "overview": "Feast of the Uninvited is the story of small lives touched by war... When the great insurrections, revolutions, the wars, sweep over everyday people, their social fabric is torn to shreds, their futures become uncertain, their lives open-ended. And in their desperate predicament they find themselves doing what would have been unthinkable during the secure and predictable times of peace. In the confusion and uncertainty that disruption brings in its wake, there will also emerge from deep inside such people strange traits, blemishes of character and even perhaps bravery - things that they never could have known had been part of them all along. The backdrop to this story is the South African Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), fought between the British Empire and two Boer republics in Southern Africa. This mini-drama series focuses on the lives of those who had to endure and suffer through it. To Captain Brooks, Harry the Welsh miner, the wealthy Van Wyk family and people like Daantjie van Wyk and his beautiful wife, Magrieta, the war became the ultimate test of who they really were.",
