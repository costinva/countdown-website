But what would have been one year for them, is only moments for viewers as each transformation is revealed instantaneously as participants enter one door and emerge from another, showing off a new version of themselves.From reconstructive surgeries to heartwarming reunions, infertility to weight loss, no hurdle is too big for the brave individuals who have chosen to take control of their lives on This Time Next Year. Before she sends them off on their journeys, Deeley meets each participant and they make their personal pledge for change in front of a live audience. Only after their reveal will viewers learn how, and if, they achieved their goals as the participants relive their challenges and share their successes.",
