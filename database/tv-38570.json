  "overview": "On the outskirts of Los Angeles, in the shadow of the Hollywood sign, are the city's roughest neighborhoods. In the late 1990s, LAPD's Foothill Homicide Unit investigated hundreds of murders, but only Detective Lindy Gligorijevic was dubbed \"the killer closer\". Driven by the need to give her victims a voice, Lindy revisits her most shocking cases, detailing how she solved each crime, and revealing how she broke the most cold-blooded killers she ever faced. Detective Lindy knows she can't bring closure to someone who's lost a loved one to murder, but what she can get them is justice.",
