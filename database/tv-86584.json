  "overview": "The main characters of the program get into \"Take it off immediately!\" thanks to letters from relatives or friends who ask to help their loved ones find joy in life again. The goal of the project is to change the heroines not only externally, but also internally. The hosts of the program will have to find out the reasons why women fall into depression, stop paying attention to themselves, and eliminate this by outlining new prospects for the heroines. According to the change, in order for a woman to change and take a new look at herself, she must act decisively and radically. Therefore, no regrets about the past - only a confident look into the future.",
