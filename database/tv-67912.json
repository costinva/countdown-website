  "overview": "The idea of having to take on four recipes on four different pages and figure out how to get them all done at once can be complicated and sometimes confusing for home cooks. In One Big Recipe, host and chef Kimberly combines all the recipes, from prep work to plating, and distills it into one master list. Chef Kimberly selects recipes that balance taste, texture, and temperature, with an eye for presentation to give it that restaurant wow factor. By combining and reverse engineering all four dishes, home-cooks get a fool-proof guide to create a stunning feast alongside Chef Kimberly.",
