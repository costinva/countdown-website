  "overview": "Best friends Shikha and Anahita turn entrepreneurs by starting a beer brand, diving into the bro-iest industry ever. But when their path to glory is blocked by those who think beer, business and women just don't mix, they are forced to use some rather unconventional methods - only to land them in further chaos amidst beer barons, mobsters and a monster of their own making.",
