  "overview": "Anna and Rosa are unlikely best friends for whom the romantic comedy dream hasn't panned out. They have no house, no partner, no baby. At least they have each other. Episode by episode they clumsily, and comically, hunt for a baby daddy to fertilize their drying-up eggs so they can co-parent in a new version of family. All while searching for affordable housing to nest in as, slowly, and surprisingly, their platonic relationship takes a romantic turn - Nesting is a provocative, funny, and unflinching web series about fertility, friendship, the housing crisis, and a mysterious little thing called love.",
