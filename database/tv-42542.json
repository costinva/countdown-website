  "overview": "The concept is that a group of people (usually 16-20 people) will live on a deserted southern sea island for 30 days with minimal equipment and food. There they are divided into two teams that will fight against each other in different competitions. Halfway through the stay, the teams are merged and the competition is thus made individual. One of the participants is voted out in each episode.",
