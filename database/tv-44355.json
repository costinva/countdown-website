Gabriel, her husband, refuses to accept that this was a suicide or an accident. Anxious to restore Rebecca's honour and protect their young daughter, he leads the investigation, gradually revealing the results of a small community hit by recession. Is this \"accident\" just the tip of a terrifying iceberg?",
