  "overview": "A new TNT humor project in which comedians will challenge the fortune of humor to catch a cash prize by the tail. Ilya Sobolev, the main \"toxic\" of the humorous scene, will give participants the opportunity to earn money from jokes, and at the same time test themselves for luck. Each of them goes on stage and jokes for one minute. If the audience thinks that the joke is funny, then a certain amount of money falls into the general pot. After the performance, the comedian stands at the end of the \"queue\", and the next one comes to the microphone. Whoever remains last will get the opportunity to increase the pot and take everything for themselves.",
