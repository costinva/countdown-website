  "overview": "The arrival of an eccentric Rita Melanson propels her once-picturesque, Acadian hometown into action when she accidentally buys both the church and the rectory. She finds herself forced to transform her newly acquired property into a profitable business in the hope of selling it. Easier said than done. Rita must contend with Lomer, her jilted ex-fiance-turned-town-mayor looming overhead. Thankfully, she has allies: her cousin Ferraille, a jack of all trades, her best friend Yolande, a reluctant farmer and Zoël, a young bohemian Québecker. Surrounded by an array of impulsive, poorly planned schemes, our merry band attempts to attract tourism and build a company to help inject new economic growth in their hometown. Tourists will definitely get their money's worth when they enter their «little Acadian cousins'» rural and quirky world. Rita Melanson's wondrous and adventurous universe welcomes you.",
