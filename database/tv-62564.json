  "overview": "The year is 1986. Teenagers are being killed one by one in the area of government dachas on Rublevsky Highway. Intelligent investigator Valery Kozyrev, his daring partner from Rostov Evgeny Bokov and a very young investigator Natalia Dobrovolskaya begin an investigation, not even suspecting how much it will change the fate of each of them. The only witness able to identify the maniac is Igor, a schoolboy, whose parents are not at all enthusiastic about their son's contacts with the police.",
