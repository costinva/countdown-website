Presenters Eibhlín Ní Chonghaile and Stiofán Ó Fearail meet children attending Gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht-based primary schools all over Ireland. The adorable young'uns share their passions, dislikes and highly original opinions on life. Each week, one school gets to produce their own version of a major pop song as Gaelige.",
