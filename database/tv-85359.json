  "overview": "What happens when a Michelin-worthy chef from Paris accidentally time-slips to the Joseon dynasty? She meets the King, a fearsome tyrant with an unexpectedly refined palate. In a bid to survive palace intrigue and royal appetites, she whips up dazzling fusion dishes that tempt even the coldest heart. But as sparks fly in the royal kitchen, a slow-burn romance simmers beneath the surface.",
