  "overview": "In this brand new four-part series John Creedon sets out on a voyage to discover Ireland's Epic East. John Creedon rides again but this time, it's the Epic East. Following his successful trip on the Wild Atlantic Way last year John is back on the road with his faithful VW campervan, his Sean Van Bhocht. But now, he's heading to the other side of the country or as John himself says, \"I'm done with the West. Now I'm going to do the rest!\" Our new tourist route, Ireland's Ancient East, takes in 17 counties and John's route will stretch from Louth to Cork and from Cavan to Wexford. But there's a lot more here than ancient history, this journey is epic. John will be travelling through thousands of years from our mythical heroes to the birth of our nation and right up to the present day.",
