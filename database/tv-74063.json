  "overview": "Master of Science student Santeri Mann, who works as a security guard, has no previous criminal record. By chance, Manni finds a large stash of amphetamines in the forest, which he begins to sell by his own means in order to get his finances in order and to get his alcoholic mother Jaana into substance abuse treatment. Soon Manni will be after both the drug league and Pasila's poison, the drug crime unit led by criminal police constable Kalle Pesonen. You may have to pay a heavy price for wrong choices.",
