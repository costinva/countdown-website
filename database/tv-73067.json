  "overview": "Hajime Madoka, a police officer of the Special Accounts Unit, has been dispatched from headquarters with a special mission to cut costs at local police stations as part of fiscal austerity. She monitors detectives' investigation expenses and suggests cost cutting plans. As she is the meticulous sort, she cannot stop thinking about a discrepancy once she spots it. She is also extraordinarily strong in numbers. Madoka was raised by her grandmother who loves detective dramas and she became a police officer because she wanted to be like the detectives she admired. However, she was born extremely unlucky and called a jinx because she gets the people around her into trouble. She was not assigned to the Criminal Affairs Division as she had hoped and ended up doing office work. Madoka sees cases from the money aspect, noticing anything odd or clues that detectives on the scene may miss to solve cases in her own unique way.",
