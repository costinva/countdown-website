  "overview": "Why leave love for fate? I Are you the one - Sweden has 20 glow singles undergoing thorough tests and interviews before arriving at a luxury home in Thailand. In the group there is one person who is each participant's \"perfect match\" - but nobody knows who it is. By hanging out in the house, competing and going on a date, the participants come week by week trying to figure out which ones are perfect for each other - and maybe be dear to the coup. The question is whether they fall for the right person? If all participants succeed in their matches, they share the winning sum: one million kronor.Â ",
