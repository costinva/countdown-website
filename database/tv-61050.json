  "overview": "Flipping Down South follows three young entrepreneurs who are heading up Birmingham, Alabama's fastest growing flipping business. They see dollar signs where others see dumps, focusing on houses most people wouldn't touch. Buying many of their flips for under $10,000, they turn eyesores into dream homes. But their mission is about more than making moneyâ€”all three investors come from working class roots, and they aim to keep their flips affordable, while still building a booming business.",
