  "overview": "I Love Paraisópolis, by Alcides Nogueira and Mario Teixeira, is set especially in São Paulo. Paraisópolis is a slum neighborhood in the city of São Paulo, belonging to the district of Vila Andrade, located in the south zone of São Paulo, with the core direction of Wolf Maya and general direction of Wolf Maya and Carlos Araújo. The colors of the clustered houses in the region contrast with the skyscrapers of the luxury neighborhood of Morumbi and form one of the largest communities in São Paulo with around 100,000 inhabitants and one million square meters, located in the south of the city. It is in this bustling scenario that the story of Marizete or Mari (Bruna Marquezine) and Pandora or Danda (Tatá Werneck), residents of Paraisópolis, takes place. Mari and Danda are \"friends-sisters\" and together they live a thousand adventures and many other problems that seem to follow them wherever they go. They are young people who want a better life and struggle to achieve their dreams. As if by fate, Mari meets Benjamin (Mauricio Destri), a resident of Morumbi and an award-winning architect who returns from New York to carry out his great project: the redevelopment of Paraisópolis. Despite being committed to Margot (Maria Casadeval), Benjamin falls in love with Mari and together they face everything and everyone to live that love.",
