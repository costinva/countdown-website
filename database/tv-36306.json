  "overview": "A crazy story of three close friends who, with their youthful energy and with their heads full of dreams, are on the verge of adulthood. It is a story about friendship, love and ambitions of young people just before entering adulthood. The axis of history are the adventures of three thirty-six-year-olds, Zosia, a graduate psychologist (Maja Bohosiewicz), Anka, a makeup artist on the set of a hit soap opera (Anna Karczmarczyk) and Bartek, living today, a typical \"jutromena\" (Piotr Nerlewski). Friends have lived together in Warsaw since their studies, together they experience highs and lows, support each other in difficult times and share their worries. At the beginning of a new stage of life, they face important decisions - choose a dream job or a drudgery for big money? Family or madness and night parties? Tie up permanently or avoid relationships? One thing is certain, despite the many obstacles that everyday life brings them, they do not give up and fight for their dreams.",
