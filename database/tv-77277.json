  "overview": "This series presents an affectionate look back at what it was like living through the early 1970s in Britain. The news stories, fads, fashions, and new essential items of a decade that moved into colour and changed everything. From Marc Bolan and David Bowie setting the new era of glam rock, eye-liner on men and the biggest platform heels and kids obsessing over new toys and transport like Clackers, Choppers and the Space hopper.",
