  "overview": "NBC is bringing the next big game show to primetime television with Identity, the ultimate game of who's who where keen perception and instincts can lead to a top prize of $500,000. In each new game, one contestant faces 12 strangers and a list of 12 traits to identify them. The contestant picks a trait - ranging anywhere from a profession to a shoe size - and tries to match it with one of the 12 strangers. The amount of money the contestant accumulates increases with each correctly identified stranger. If all 12 are matched up correctly, the player is rewarded with the grand prize of $500,000. The series is hosted by Emmy Award-winning comedian/magician Penn Jillette. Identity also offers viewers at home the chance to play the watch-and-win \"Identity Challenge\" for a chance at $10,000.",
