To ignore speculation, prediction and guesswork, but at all times to follow instruction and pursue luck.Over six, thirty-minute episodes, Dave will present the evidence to an astrologically balanced studio audience. Receiving help and guidance from three world-renowned, independent experts in the fields of Love, Health and Wealth – Denise Robertson, Hilary Jones and Alvin Hall – the audience will then vote on whether Dave's or the control's life is turning out better.  Whatever the result, in Dave's world truth is stranger than fiction.",
