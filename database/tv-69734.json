Biologist Shane Campbell-Staton travels the globe to explore our Human Footprint and to discover how the things we do reveal who we truly are.Biologist Shane Campbell-Staton returns to further explore the global impact of Earth's most ingenious, destructive, and adaptive species: humans. In his quest, Shane discovers that although we often tell ourselves what it means to be human, the clearest vision of who we are emerges from what we do. In that way, this series is a journey not only to understand our human impacts but also to explore our human nature.",
