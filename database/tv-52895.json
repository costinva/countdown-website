  "overview": "Rush: Inspired by Battlefield, the digital series, brings the epic scale and truly immersive photo realistic game play of Battlefield to the next level in a live-action, special effects-laden story that's sure to excite fans, both old and new, while demonstrating core aspects of the game franchise including teamwork, strategy and community. It focuses the core conflict on a battle between squads of good and evil. Both are ex-military, both are guns for hire, but only one is in it for profit. It's a story that questions being a soldier, and what matters most when you're in an all-out war. Like the game franchise, it teaches protagonist - Zach Miller - what a hero really is, that nobody can win a war all by themselves, and that most times, success results from working together.",
