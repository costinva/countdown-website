  "overview": "Real Deal features high-stakes negotiations and the nerve-wracking anxiety of auction. Sellers bring their family heirlooms, historic items, and rare memorabilia to expert dealers who evaluate the items and put a cash offer on the table. An intense negotiation begins and the pressure rises as ultimately the sellers hold the cards and will make the choice between the certainty of cash on the table and the unknowns of an auction, where there are no guarantees.",
