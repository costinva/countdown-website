  "overview": "Ainsley and his chef friends cook al fresco in the walled kitchen gardens of the UK's finest National Trust stately homes. In each episode, Ainsley Harriott is joined by two guest chefs in the kitchen gardens of the historic estates who he will challenge to create and cook recipes using the bounty of the garden in an attempt to win the accolade of â€˜Dish of the Day' whilst celebrating the abundance and beauty of fresh British produce grown by the Trust's team of staff and volunteers.Alongside the fun of outdoor cooking and friendly competition, Ainsley meets the staff and volunteers of the Trust, and finds out about the work they do to maintain the gardens and estates - picking up handy gardening tips along the way.",
