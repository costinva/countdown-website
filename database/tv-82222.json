  "overview": "Planet Weird is a quirky, light-hearted celebration of the planet's most bizarre creatures in the animal kingdom. Along with witty, tongue-in-cheek narration, by renowned UK comic Ross Noble, the series plays with pop culture, graphics, and human comparisons to make the absolute extremities of nature leap right off the screen and into the modern world. In short, digestible stories, viewers meet the critters who are faster than a speeding bullet, and more powerful than a locomotive. But inside every moment of ‘weird' is a revelation of cleverness, amazing adaptation and scientific surprise.",
