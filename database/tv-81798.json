  "overview": "It's a crisis! Rita, 50, discovers that her husband, Olivier, has cheated on her. But Rita and Olivier have been together for thirty years, with four children, and when she's not looking after them, Rita helps Olivier by doing the accounting for his garage-body shop. But who is this \"other\" woman? Olympe, 38, a senior executive at Valières, a major French luxury leather goods brand, is the opposite of Rita. A powerful woman, she comes from a very privileged background. A workaholic and ambitious, she's chic, beautiful, and has a CV as long as your arm. Rita decides to confront her and goes to the Valières headquarters. But nothing goes as planned. And while Rita has every reason to hate Olympe, and Olympe to distrust Rita, Rita will on the contrary, even though she knows nothing about the world of luxury,... become Olympe's assistant! Forced to work together, how long can such a duo last?",
