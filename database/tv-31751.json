  "overview": "Nestor Burma (Guy Marchand) is a cynical private detective, a serial monogamist and an inveterate saxophone player. Burma investigates murders, missing persons, kidnapping and extortion cases in every arrondissement of The City of Light. It's a tough job, but Burma's just the man for it - with more than a little help from his lovelorn secretary, Hélène, and his cat Rifif.",
