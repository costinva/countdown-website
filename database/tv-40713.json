  "overview": "Travelling by propeller plane, helicopter, camel, golf buggy, bicycle, boats, 4x4s and and on foot, Julia embarks on an epic journey to discover modern Australia and the people who live there.Whether warming up with the cast at the Sydney Opera House, serving up breakfast on the Ghan train, joining the surf patrol on Bondi Beach, or interviewing candidates for what some say is the world's best job - as a desert island caretaker on the Great Barrier Reef - Julia's quest takes in all four corners of the country, its iconic destinations and unique experiences. She explores Australian family life as it is lived across the continent â€“ whether on a remote cattle station or at an Aboriginal outback swag. She goes to work with mums who are crocodile egg hunters, ranchers, and outback pilots, plays teacher for a day at the Red Centre's School of the Air and hits the road with a retired \"grey nomad\" in his specially adapted touring caravans. Throughout her journey, Julia hunts for unexpected aspects of modern Australia, meeting the instructor at the country's only doggy surfing school, getting to grips with kangaroo golf, discovering the world's most isolated pub, and enlisting in a boat race thousands of miles away from water. Her trek takes her through a spectrum of spectacular landscapes from rainforest to red desert, with unique wildlife encounters including meeting emus, platypus, koalas, bowerbirds, and green turtles.",
