  "overview": "The show revolves around fictitious motivational speaker Bob Patterson, \"America's #3 Self Help Guru,\" who is popular with millions of people across America, thanks to his books I Know More Than You, I Still Know More Than You and the To the Top! franchise. Friction between his job and family occurs due in part to Bob's self-absorbed but insecure nature and complete lack of self-awareness, ironic qualities for someone whose job is supposed to be selflessly motivating others to improve their lives.",
