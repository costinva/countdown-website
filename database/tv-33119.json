  "overview": "Class is in session and Ice-T, the Original Gangsta, is gonna school ya. In Ice-T's Rap School, Ice invades the hallowed halls of York Prep, an exclusive private school in Manhattan's tony upper west side. And in just six weeks, he'll try to transform a small class of 8th grade sucka MCs into big-time rappers. Ice delivers some hardcore lessons in rhyming, scratching, and breakdancing. And after a roller-coaster journey of nail-biting auditions and pressure-packed recording sessions, the kids face the ultimate final exam: opening up for Public Enemy at BB Kings in New York. Will Ice win over straight-laced students, skeptical parents, and distrusting faculty? Will he be able to turn these prepsters into true playas?",
