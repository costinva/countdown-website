  "overview": "Faking the Video is a six-week, hidden-camera series in which celebs and actors fool six, unsuspecting production assistants on a (fake) shoot for a \"We Are the World\"-style music video.In each episode, filmed in Los Angeles, the P.A.s – thinking they have a career-making opportunity – are faced with situations that go horribly wrong. In Monday's premiere, a rain-making machine malfunctions, flooding the soundstage and the P.A.s have to bail the water in buckets. In a later episode, a P.A. standing in front of a green-screen in a green spandex suit is made to prance around holding a cardboard cutout of a cloud. He thinks he is going to be removed from the special effect, but is not, since the entire set-up is phony.When it's all over, the winner gets a $3,500 prize package and a job on Wayne Isham video. (All contestants received a $1,000 salary and cash prize and over $1,500 in electronics merchandise.)",
