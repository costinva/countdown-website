  "overview": "About the beautiful Tic say: \"On a crooked goat you will not drive up.\" But Ticha knows how not only to remember grievances. She is a lawyer, and a brilliant career for her is more reliable than a man nearby. Workaholic Tic firmly decided - happiness in work. Happiness herself did not agree and came to her right to work in the image of a sassy cute guy-trainee Q. Ah, that age difference between a man and a woman! Well, what worthy lady would want to be some kind of nuna next to a young man, albeit desperately in love? Such a misalliance can not arrange and Tic. Why does she need gossip, oblique glances, all this hassle, when an insidious colleague-rival strives to set up a bandwagon and go around the career ladder? But Happiness in the face of the insistent Q does not lag behind Tichie, follows on his heels, flapping long eyelashes, looks into his eyes and with a naive smile says in the hope: \"Do not be afraid to love.\" Will Tica decide on this adventure?",
