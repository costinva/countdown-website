  "overview": "Spa Wars is a brand new competitive beauty series that pitches three rival salons owners against each other to find out whose treatments offer the best value for money. Narrated by television personality Rylan Clark-Neal, each episode sees three local beauticians take it in turns to visit each other's salons, where they are plumped, preened and pampered to perfection before deciding how much they're willing to pay for their treatments. At the end of all three visits, the salon that's been paid the highest percentage of their total bill is crowned that week's Spa Wars Winner. These results are revealed to them by a surprise guest celebrity!There's high drama, hilarious moments, unusual beauty treatments, and a hefty dose of criticism, because when beauty is your business, image is everything!",
