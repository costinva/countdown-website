  "overview": "The year is 1886, when New England's fishing harbours are the scene for a \"creature of unknown origin\" destroying ships at sea. It is the job of Professor Pierre Arronax, a marine expert, and Ned Land, the iron-willed sailor, to learn the truth of the \"monster\" roaming the seas. The great novelist, Jules Verne, described this perilous journey to the darkest depths of the sea with Captain Nemo aboard the Nautilus.",
