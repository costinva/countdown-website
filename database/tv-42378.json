  "overview": "Restaurants serve all kinds of food in all kinds of settings, each with their own unique style -- and some are more unique than others. This series bypasses average diners and quaint little cafes to find the strangest and wackiest of the bunch. Host Bob Blumer travels the world in search of these eatery oddities. Want to dine naked? Or blindfolded? Maybe you'd rather be waited on by drag queens or mock-attacked by a ninja while you eat? There's always the option of treating your dog for a four-course, gourmet meal. These are some of the not-so-average dinner services available at the World's Weirdest Restaurants.",
