  "overview": "Offline with Jon Favreau is a different kind of Sunday show â€“ a chance to step away from our Twitter-fueled news cycles to hear smarter, lighter conversations about all the ways that our extremely online existence is shaping everything from politics and culture to the ways we live, work, and interact with one another. Join Jon each week as he asks us to put down our screens, grab our headphones, and figure out how to live happier, healthier lives, both on and offline.",
