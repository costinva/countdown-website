  "overview": "Hip Hop: The Songs That Shook America examines six songs based on the impact the song had on the time of its creation and beyond; we pick the hip-hop song that had the biggest impact both musically and culturally. Artists will deconstruct the song and walk us through the impact the song had on them personally. Along the way, we take a deep dive into the socio-economic and cultural conditions that inspired the landmark work... and gave voice to a generation.",
