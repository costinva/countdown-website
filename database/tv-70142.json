  "overview": "Comedy Island Philippines features seven comedians, actors, and social media celebrities—Carlo Aquino, Rufa Mae Quinto, Andrea Brillantes, Jerald Napoles, Cai Cortez, Awra Briguela, Justine Luzares, and Drew Arellano—who embark on a hilarious adventure when they are washed upon the shore of the mysterious Tawa-Tawa Island, which resurfaces after 100 years to commence the fictional \"Centennial Games.\" They soon find themselves unwitting competitors in these games, and must improvise to survive and escape the island. Pitted against each other in unscripted improvisational scenarios, the celebrities pull out all stops to bring laughter and entertainment to the island's citizens, in order to win the most votes and a chance to go back home.",
