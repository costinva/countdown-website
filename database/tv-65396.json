  "overview": "Show \"Korea No.1\" is a program in which three people Yoo Jae-suk, Kim Yeon-koung and Lee Kwang-soo visit Korea's No.1 master craftsmen, pour out all their physical and mental strength, experience traditional labor and struggle to become No.1 of the day. They will visit local places we did not know and personally experience harsh labor. It is expected that the appearance of three people traveling around No.1 places where Korean tradition resides and sincerely working as well as their non-stop talks and unpredictable body gags will give viewers big laughs.",
