  "overview": "When the position of the president of the company sailed away from Lin, and her father accused her of irresponsibility, she decided to buy herself a husband! An athletic oyster seller caught my eye. The bow succumbed to the persuasions of a friend and performed an incendiary dance for bored virgins. And I woke up with the most beautiful and drunk in the same bed. His life has changed dramatically. The hapless visionary entrepreneur risked accepting the offer of a crazy blackmailer. The motives of the assertive Lin are clear. And what does the Bow hide? And did he guess what this adventure would turn out to be?",
