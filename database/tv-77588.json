  "overview": "99 to Beat is the game show that anyone can win, but there's one rule players must follow if they're to be in with a chance of walking away with the cash prize â€“ Don't. Come. Last. As contestants battle it out against each other, each round will see the number of players whittled down until one person takes the top prize.",
