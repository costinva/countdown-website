  "overview": "Mountains of gumdrops, piles of taffy, and confections to the ceiling.... Candy Queen goes inside the Wonka-like workshop of Los Angeles-based event planner Jackie Sorkin as she builds an edible empire. Jackie and her team - engineer Adam and the rest of the \"Candy Crew\" - hustle to make their clients every wish turned into an over-the-top experience filled with custom candy creations. From celebrity events like Hank Azaria's Determined to Succeed Organization, to a literally Sweet Sixteen dress made out of candy, Jackie's transforming everyday treats into extraordinary works of art. Now, she's expanding her operations and taking on even more challenging projects in an effort to take her company to the next level. As if the demands of growing a business weren't enough, Jackie's also juggling a full-time family - baby #2 arrives in late November, and joins a supportive husband, adorable daughter, and very opinionated parents. Jackie's a workaholic, but she's willing to risk total meltdown if it means having all of her sweet dreams come true.",
