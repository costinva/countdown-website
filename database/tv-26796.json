  "overview": "Raven's Home picks up with longtime best friends Raven and Chelsea, who are now each divorced with kids of their own, raising their children – Raven's 11-year-old twins Booker and Nia, and Chelsea's 9-year-old son Levi – under one roof, in a chaotic but fun household that often includes the twin's best friend and neighbor Tess. Unbeknownst to her kids, Raven still catches glimpses of the future, and unbeknownst to her, Booker has just learned he has these same abilities. Hilarity ensues as Raven and Booker's visions collide, but no matter the situation, they figure everything out together as one big happy family.",
