  "overview": "Elodie and Yvan move for the first time into a house with a garden, in a new neighborhood. It's an important step, supposed to give a new breath to their couple and a better balance to their teenagers: Achille, a gifted boy and Chloé, a more fragile girl. Fortunately, there is Bruno, the neighbor, who is nice and attentive to each member of the family. A real nice surprise. But little by little Bruno reveals his dark side. Could his growing intimacy with Elodie and Chloé be hiding a desire to control this family, or even to destroy it? The day Elodie begins a passionate relationship with Bruno, she does not know that she has put her finger in a vicious circle from which no one will emerge unscathed.",
