  "overview": "Yu Hao gave birth to two sons and a daughter. The eldest son returned from studying abroad and brought back his wife Susie. His foreign style made the old couple quite unacceptable. The second son, Fugui, doesn't seem to grow up, and he loves karts. Because he is old at home, his ramen skills are \"passed on to men but not to women.\" Tan Gege got acquainted with the second son of the Yu family because of the car, and became one of the temporary members of the Yu family. The old couple in the Yu family have a lot of troubles all day long, and Yu Haosheng has a stubborn and conservative personality. He always wants to say things he doesn't like, but if he says it, it's as if he didn't say it.",
