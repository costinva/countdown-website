  "overview": "Each week, 10 celebrities team up with a family member or friend to compete in dance challenges on the dance floor and face the celebrity judges who assess and score their performances. The couple with the highest score wins immunity, while the two teams with the lowest scores face elimination. Couples in jeopardy then face off in a dance duel, and viewers at home vote for the team they want to save.",
