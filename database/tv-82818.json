  "overview": "Lana is a super-feisty, forward-thinking and passionate 11-year-old girl, who is also the heir to her father's adventuring ship, the Mighty Windbreaker. Along with her captain dad and his diverse crew (an orc, a dwarf, a barbarian and a cyclops), she sails across the Ten Realms, dreaming of becoming one of the greatest adventurers of all time. But first, she must overcome some challenging obstacles: impulsivity, stubbornness, extreme curiosity, disdain for rules â€¦ and a love of pancakes. All the best things about her!",
