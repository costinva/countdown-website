  "overview": "SU Ming-yi (played by CHENG Yu-xi) holds her first photography exhibition, reflecting on her youth and thinking of YAN Li-yao (played by SHIH Bo-yu). In high school, she was the class monitor, secretly admiring YAN Li-yao. Despite his frequent absences, they crossed paths often, with her feelings hidden. YAN Li-yao and CHENG Yan (played by LIN Zi-heng) were close but had contrasting personalities. After SU Ming-yi confessed, YAN Li-yao suggested a “trial” relationship. After graduation, they each buried their secrets. Years later, through an old roll of film and a photography exhibition, these long-hidden feelings are finally revealed, offering redemption for all involved.",
