She then embarked on money laundering, using a bakery as a facade. Liana is a broke single mom trying to get her life back on track. Her ex-boyfriend is in jail for a theft in which the loot amounts to 47 million crowns. Soon, the two women's paths will cross in ways they never could have imagined.",
