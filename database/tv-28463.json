  "overview": "Burden of Truth is an investigative drama about life-altering legal cases. Fast-rising corporate attorney Joanna Hanley returns to her small hometown of Millwood - a prairie town with an industrial past and uncertain future - to represent a major client in a case against some sick high school girls. She dispatches her case quickly and efficiently, crushing the girls and their small-town lawyer - her former high school classmate Billy Crawford. After winning her case, she discovers the girls are sicker than anyone thought. Otherwise healthy young women have been overcome with uncontrollable twitches and seizures, making life unlivable. They need help. Joanna also realizes she may have unresolved personal business in town. Even though she's a successful partner in a big law firm, she can't ignore the feeling that something in her life is not right. She becomes convinced all the answers she's seeking about her broken life can be found in her old hometown. And if she's going to fix herself, she has to start where it all began - with uncovering all of her family's deepest secrets.",
