  "overview": "When a high-ranking head of the Swedish Migration Agency is found murdered in his home, the list of suspects is long. Assistant Prosecutor, Jana Berzelius soon realises that the murder has something to do with her own background and steps in to participate in the investigation. As she attends a boy's autopsy, she see a familiar scar on his neck. Cut into his flesh are markings which trigger in her a flash of memory from her own dark childhood. To get closer to the truth of her own horrific hidden past, she must find the perpetrator behind these murders before the police do. Brilliant but emotionally cold, just like her famous prosecutor father, Jana finds herself drawn deeper and deeper into this dark and mysterious investigation, as more of her sinister memories are awakened. Based on award winning crime writer Emelie Schepp's novels sold in more than 3 million copies across 30 countries. ",
