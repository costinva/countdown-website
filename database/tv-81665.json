  "overview": "Arman Alizad's documentary series takes viewers to the edge of the world and explores what humanity is doing right and what is wrong. Human influence on the world has expanded so widely with the development of technology and science that in 2008, Vatican Archbishop Gianfranco Girrotti named the new deadly sins of the modern world. Inspired by these, Arman Alizad has examined the injustices that prevail in our world and wonders if they are really sins.",
