  "overview": "Motto of the show \"Aesthetics of the Soviet era: the life and dreams of the USSR!\"Description:1922-1991 is not just a period of time, but an entire epoch with its own peculiarities, scientific discoveries, sport achievements, cultural phenomena. This era has left a legacy, which is still interesting and relevant. Someone is still nostalgic for his Soviet childhood spent in the pioneer camp. Someone at home keeps collections of stamps with Gagarin, porcelain Komsomol members and filings of the magazine Krokodil. Others revise the cheerful comedy of the thirties with Lubov Orlova and the post-war tales of Alexander Rowe. Everyone will find for themselves in the Soviet era something curious and fascinating.\"Made in the USSR\" is a series of documentary programs dedicated to Soviet aesthetics and culture, everyday life of people and behind-the-scenes life of idols, high art and fleeting fashion.",
