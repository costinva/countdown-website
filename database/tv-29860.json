  "overview": "Each week, two teams each take one hulking old vehicle and transform it into a mind-blowing piece of machinery capable of completing a fiendish challenge set by host Jason Bradbury. The series brings ingenuity, energy and passion to our screens in a fun and competitive format that brings engineering out of the shed. What if you had to turn a cement lorry into a boat or a milk float into a dragster? Where would you start? Have you got what it takes to be a Motor Morpher?",
