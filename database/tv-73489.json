  "overview": "After another scandal, the son of a Soviet functionary is sent for correction to the organizing committee of the 1980 Olympics, where he begins to work as a simple volunteer. His boss is the daughter of a high-ranking military man, and she is not going to do any favors for a spoiled guy from a rich family. Finding himself on the other side of the poster of a world event, he will meet different people who will change his views on life - athletes, coaches and other volunteers. Through their eyes he will see all the drama surrounding the preparation for the big competition, which was on the verge of failure.",
