  "overview": "A Conspiração, a documentary series directed by António-Pedro Vasconcelos, is the result of a meticulous investigation that includes exclusive testimonies from protagonists who managed to achieve in less than 24 hours, something that many others had not achieved in 48 years. From the secret meetings to the key characters, we are shown the extraordinary conspiratorial process that began in the summer of 1973 and culminated in the early hours of April 25, 1974, with the overthrow of the Estado Novo and the conquest of freedom. The rest, as they say, is history.",
