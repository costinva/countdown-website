  "overview": "In Haunting in the Heartland, paranormal investigator and documentary filmmaker Steve Shippy visits Midwestern towns that have been traumatized for generations by ripples of fear. Growing up in a rural Michigan \"creepy house on the corner,\" Shippy uses his own personal experiences to make intimate connections with the families who've reached out to him for help. He then puts the puzzle pieces together to identify and decipher the larger mystery of the town's haunting.Through eyewitness accounts, town archives, visits to historic sites and his own paranormal toolkit, Shippy explores emerging theories until a full picture of the town's ghostly protagonist appears, and a peaceful resolution can be formulated. On his journey through a new heartland town in each of the six one-hour episodes, Shippy seeks to directly confront the entity and bring closure to the people of the town.",
