  "overview": "Thanks to the time difference between the locations, the financial markets in Europe open when most Americans are sleeping. Bloomberg Markets: European Open covers the start of the European trading day with this show -- which airs in the early morning hours in the Eastern time zone -- as part of the network's programming block dedicated to covering financial activity overseas. The show, broadcast from London, features discussions of the stories that are expected to impact the European markets that day and, subsequently, other markets around the world.",
