  "overview": "Four great friends, in their thirties, are always talking about women, drinking and boasting about their achievements. But for the first time in their lives, they must face a problem for which they can not find a solution: one of them is impotent. Nothing works: neither the doctor, nor the Viagra, nor the therapy. Now he needs the help of his best friends to try to live with this new condition in his life. Homens? is like a male version of Sex and the City where the beautiful clothes and the dream of marrying a prince are set aside. What do men want? What can men do? What is happening to men in the era of toxic masculinity? This is a comedy drama trying to find, if not the answers, at least the way.",
