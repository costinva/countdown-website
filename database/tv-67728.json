  "overview": "A comical look at the Japanese legal system. Big corporate law firm seeking to increase their profit margin notices that a lot of the partners spend a lot of their time on cases which don't bring in a lot of revenue. They decide they need to hire an average lawyer, at a minimal salary, that will take care of these small cases and not complain. That's why the law firm hires Hanamura Daisuke to handle these minor cases. Daisuke's approach to the law is very unique and the way he handles each case is very entertaining.",
