  "overview": "Four bandits in the late nineties come to knock money out of the debtor, but accidentally fall into the cryocamera — and end up in 2022. Phil, Chuck, Whizz and the Mass do not immediately realize that during this time Moscow has radically changed, their lifestyle has become very outdated, and people around have a lot of unfamiliar devices and strange habits. The worst thing is that their loved ones have grown older, and now someone will have to rebuild a relationship with their son, who has become his age, and someone will have to win the heart of an already much-matured girlfriend. Now the four friends must find themselves in a new incomprehensible world and take revenge on the former boss, who sent them to the cryocamera.",
