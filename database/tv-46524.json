  "overview": "The children's series plays in Ms. Siebenstein's junk shop in Berlin (until 2002: Adelheid Arndt, since 2004: Henriette Heinze), who tells stories with the cheeky raven Rudi and a know-it-old travel case. These often come from well-known children's book authors such as Paul Maar, Gudrun Mebs, Rudolf Herfurtner, Kirsten Boie and Cornelia Funke and are presented in the form of short cartoons",
