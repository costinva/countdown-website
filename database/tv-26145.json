  "overview": "Interior designer Mako is unable to forget his first love who helped him when he was bullied, back in elementary school days. One day, a mail arrives from an ID named \"Kosuke\" same as Mako's first love name. \"Do you remember me? Please contact me because I want to see you after a long time\". Mako is excited to see her again for the first time in 22 years, but the \"Kosuke\" who appears is far from the girl he imagined.",
