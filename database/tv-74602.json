  "overview": "Do we have the right to determine our own death? The rising death rate in terminally ill patients raises a doubt in Police Major Wasan's heart he cannot shake. Recently, just before he could make it back to her, his mother has passed away. Given the circumstances, she may be one in a series of suspicious deaths. Dr. Kantaphat, the doctor who'd taken care of Wasan's mother in her final days, becomes important to his grieving heart. The deeper his feelings grow, however, the more the mystery seems to link back to his lover, bit by bit.",
