  "overview": "Oxygen is dropping viewers in the middle of the action at a dynamic Chagrin Valley area emergency call center in Ohio.  At the center, the responders' calm demeanor, quick thinking, and ability to draw out essential information from callers in the midst of extreme situations is often the difference between life and death. From gut-wrenching to heartwarming, these very first responders hear it all over the course of a 12-hour shift. ",
