  "overview": "With all the ingredients of a Hollywood movie, this sex scandal shocked, enthralled, and enraged 1990s America. 34-year-old elementary school teacher, Mary Kay Letourneau, who was married with 4 kids, began an affair in 1997 with her 12-year-old student, Vili Fualauu. They not only didn't deny the outrageous behavior, but they would also eventually embrace the love affair that included French-kissing on school grounds, trysts in her van, and even sexual rendezvous in her family home. The question on everyone's mind was: Is this true love, or is Mary Kay Letourneau a pedophile, guilty of child rape?",
