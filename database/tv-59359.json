  "overview": "Get Millie Black follows ex-Scotland Yard detective Millie-Jean Black who returns home to Jamaica after her mother's passing and joins the Kingston police force. When a local girl disappears, Millie and her partner uncover ties to a prominent family — just as a Scotland Yard inspector arrives with his own agenda. Haunted by the ghosts of a sibling who refuses to be saved and a child who can't be found, Millie's search for the truth leads her on an intercontinental chase that threatens to blow up her world. ",
