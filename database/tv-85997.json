  "overview": "Narrated by Michael Palin, this fascinating series follows the incredible lives of trees - from their beginning as tiny seeds through to magnificent giants and into old age, revealing the secrets of how they communicate, how they drink and even how some of the three trillion trees on our planet are as old as the pyramids.Even the mightiest oak must start life as a tiny acorn. In the first film, we explore the secret lives of young trees â€“ discovering how they magically transform from minute seeds into mature adults. But with fewer than one in a thousand seeds reaching adulthood, a tree's early years are the most treacherous of its life.",
