  "overview": "The East African Elephant, a keystone species that supports multiple ecosystems and vital for global health, is in jeopardy. At the turn of the century, Africa was home to ten million elephants. But due to the recent growth of the Ivory industry, as little as four hundred thousand remain. Tanzania is the frontline in the fight to save the species. The parks are in crisis mode. The Tanzanian Rangers are out gunned and under manned as poachers continue the slaughter. Blood Ivory follows their struggle as they hunt for these crews of suspected elephant poachers.",
