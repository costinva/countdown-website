  "overview": "Its purpose was to stage and film the meeting of a public figure (singers for the most part) with one of his admirers, to the surprise of the latter, generally in a place that is familiar to him such as his home, with the complicity of his relatives. For each meeting, five per evening, the program alternated a portrait of the admirer drawn up by testimonies from his relatives, with reports on the preparations for the meeting, then the meeting itself. Finally, the celebrity, his admirer, and his close accomplices of the show, found themselves on set, it was the scene of L'Olympia, or in a setting imitating this one, installed in a studio of the House Radio with host Flavie Flament to talk about the meeting.",
