  "overview": "Musicals have a storied legacy in Hollywood movies, dating back to the 1920s when 'The Jazz Singer' helped to bring in the era of talkies. This programme features stars of some of the genre's most prolific films discussing the projects. The show also tracks the evolution of the musical, from the '20s and early 1930s -- when Shirley Temple got her start -- through the middle and latter parts of the 20th century and even into modern fare, including 2006's \"Dreamgirls.\" Liza Minnelli, Shirley MacLaine, Mickey Rooney and Debbie Reynolds are among the stars who reflect upon the history of musicals in Hollywood.",
