  "overview": "Phillip Schofield has graced our screens for over 40 years. He has faced countless daunting experiences throughout his career but none more demanding than being cast away for ten days on a tropical island, 50 kilometres off the northern coast of Madagascar.After a training day with a survival expert, Phillip takes his final boat ride to the island, where he'll be utterly alone and filming himself with no crew - forced to reckon with both the unforgiving environment and effects of total isolation. Landing on the island's beach, he is excited and optimistic about the challenge ahead. But with gale force winds ripping into his camp in the middle of the night, he soon realises this might be harder than expected.As the days pass Phillip is left to navigate his new island home alone, attempting to scavenge for mangoes, find a water source and catch fish. His time alone offers him opportunities to reflect on some of the tougher times in his life.After days without any meaningful food, he desperately ventures into the jungle at dusk in hopes of catching a crab for dinner. But as the dark sets in he finds himself lost in the dense jungle with only a headlamp and no idea of how to get back to camp. Disorientated and alone, panic starts to set in.",
