  "overview": "BBC Radio 1's Dev introduces a series of short films that reflect on life in the digital environment, as part of a season marking the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web.Taking a closer look at aspects of modern life such as binge watching, internet dating, and the roll-out of rural high-speed internet, the 11 short films - commissioned by BBC Arts and the BFI - explore the digital landscape through the eyes of both digital natives and those who experienced the pre-internet world. The filmmakers reflect on, respond to and capture the experience of living in a digital environment, as well as show how they have been shaped by it or even resisted it.",
