  "overview": "Power of 10 is a high-stakes game that challenges contestants to guess the behaviors, opinions and lifestyle choices of the American public for the chance to win $10 million dollars. Power of 10 polls thousands of people across the U.S. asking them, well, just about everything - from \"What percentage of married Americans said they were virgins the day they got married?\" to \"What percentage of American's believe they are smarter than the president?\" Each week, contestants must decide if they have their finger on the pulse of the American majority and can accurately predict the results of these nationwide surveys. With the first question worth $1,000 and only five questions to answer, each one increasing 10 times in value, contestants participate in a potentially lucrative game where they just might walk away with $10 million. The higher they are on the money ladder, the closer they must be to the actual statistic. The studio audience and a friend can help them, but the final answer is theirs.",
