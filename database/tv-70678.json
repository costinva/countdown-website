  "overview": "A half-Thai Chinese-Maly orphanage girl, Bunga, lives with her granny Kimluan and makes a living by tapping rubber in the Southern part. Unfortunately, granny is deceived by Boss Wieng to sign the loan agreement and offer Bunga as insurance. When Bunga is about to become Wieng's mistress, she escapes and gets on the train to Pattani province and meets her first love, Tawan, there. At the time Kimluan is seriously ill, Bunga and Tawan return home, but they are chased by Wieng. During the survival escape, Bunga falls overboard and gets lost in the storm. The couple must separate without knowing how good or bad the other is. But it seems like fate works in a strange way; it brings them to meet again, but Bunga forgets Tawan already and becomes another man's fianc√©e.",
