  "overview": "Bereft of hope, Shinsuke Tanaka, aka Shorts Hansuke, comes with his cat Tora, to the temporary housing settlement that still remains twelve years after the great disaster known as The What. His job is to report to the shady Mikimoto on the lives of the residents, every last one of which is a quirky screwball: Roku-chan, the driver of an invisible train; a homeless father and son who daydream of someday building a mansion; a father who has many children after marrying a pop idol who came to visit the disaster victims; two drunken married couples who argue endlessly, and a young girl Ganmodoki, who labors away silently at home making masks.",
