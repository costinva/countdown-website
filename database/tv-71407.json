  "overview": "Join Helen Skelton and Jules Hudson live from Barleylands Farm in Essex, mucking in with Britain's farmers as they bring in the harvest that will keep the country fed this year.Stripped across four nights, our hosts celebrate the best British food, at a make-or-break time of the year – when the weather make be the difference between a bountiful harvest and complete washout.They are joined by Cannon Hall Farm's favourite brothers Rob and Dave Nicholson, plus special guests, presenter-turned-farmer George Lamb, Dr Amir Khan, farm regular JB Gill, and Reuben Owen from Our Yorkshire Farm. They'll keep tally on the star crops that have come in big this year, as well as meeting the producers who turn these humble looking plants into everyday favourites.Across the week we celebrate great British food heroes – from the wheat farmers and bakers who give Britain our daily bread, to the crops that give us a kickstart in the morning. We pick the fruits and vegetables that tickle our palates and make us merry – and we follow our entire food supply chain from field to fork. And we encourage our audience to Eat to Save the World – launching a campaign to help people eat local, lower their food miles, reduce their food waste and try delicious new dishes.Culminating with a harvest festival at the end of the week, this is an epic celebration of great British food and farming!",
