  "overview": "A new drama about the murder of Stephen Lawrence will be set 13 years after the black teenager was killed and will depict his parents' fight for justice.Stephen, which has been commissioned by ITV, will be a three-part sequel to 1999's The Murder Of Stephen Lawrence and will portray events from 2006.It will tell the story of the ongoing struggle by his parents Doreen and Neville Lawrence to achieve justice and how a detective, DCI Clive Driscoll – working closely with the Lawrences – put together an investigation that finally secured the convictions of two of the gang who committed the murder, more than 18 years later.Their son was murdered in a racially motivated attack while waiting for a bus in Well Hall Road, Eltham, south-east London, on April 22 1993.The original investigation had failed to convict those responsible, and the campaign for justice by the Lawrences led to a public inquiry which branded the Metropolitan Police institutionally racist and brought about sweeping changes in the law and police practices.However, six years on from the inquiry, no progress had been made in the case.",
