The whole city counts on commissioner Edward Popielski. However, the commissioner does not want to pursue the case. Not this time. The specter of the impending war and paralyzing fear rule Lviv, only its criminal world still lives according to the old rules. Everyone knows Popielski, who works only at night. Nobody wants to work with him. Nobody wants to expose themselves to him. The city steeped in crime has obscured the shadow of Erinia, the goddesses of vengeance.",
