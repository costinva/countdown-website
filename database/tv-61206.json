  "overview": "The restaurant called Monet is one of the best fine dining places in Budapest, but according to Győző, the alcoholic and sports addict Chef, it is definitely the best restaurant on earth. The kitchen is full of special monks: a fish cook with an underworld history, a knife virtuoso stealing from the kitchen, a stuttering chef, a French-born, warm confectioner and a Russian omnipotent. Milan drops into this eccentric team as a green-eared chef, and although the Chef is not happy about him at first, he takes it under his wings and tries to carve a chef and man out of his cheeky and immature Milan in his own raw and rhapsodic way.",
