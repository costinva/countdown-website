  "overview": "The incredible true story of the brave crewmen who survived a shipwreck, only to face an even more terrifying peril. After delivering components for the atomic bomb that will bring WWII to an end, a mighty naval cruiser is torpedoed, leaving 900 men in the middle of nowhere. With the men clinging to floating debris and one another, and with the U.S. Navy unaware of their distress, ravenous sharks move in for the kill.",
