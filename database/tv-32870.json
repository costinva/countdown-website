  "overview": "Last Stop Garage stars a colourful crew of ingenious mechanics who operate out of CRB Automotive â€“ a family-owned garage in North West River, located at one of the furthest driveable points on the eastern seaboard. Using sometimes questionable backwoods resourcefulness, the clever automotive-hack specialists put their \"mechanical magic\" to work, fixing and building just about anything for anyone in their remote town of 553 residents. With a whole lot of heart, they \"get'er done\", Labrador style. Just as the community relies on the shop, the mechanics rely on the eccentric locals for wisdom, parts, and a helping hand.",
