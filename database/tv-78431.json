  "overview": "Former nurse-turned-exotic animal broker Tonia Haddix, who refers to herself as the \"Dolly Parton of chimps,\" spends her days caring for animals in captivity. However, her limitless love for one chimpanzee in particular spins into a wild cat-and-mouse game with authorities and an animal rights group. Through Tonia's and other \"chimp mom\" experiences, Chimp Crazy reveals the singular bonds that form between owners and their highly intelligent great ape pets. The series exposes the risks humans take when they try to raise these animals as members of their family, as well as the risks to the welfare of the animals themselves.",
