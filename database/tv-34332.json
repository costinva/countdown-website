  "overview": "\"What does a young man ask about, wishing to meet a girl?\", \"What is a foreigner surprised at in Russia?\" - it is impossible to find any unique correct answers to such questions. Because how many people, so many opinions.And the goal of the game \"One hundred to one\" is to guess the most common answers given by random passers-by. And these answers are sometimes not only funny, but also unpredictable. Well, who would have thought that the question \"Who maintains order in the country?\" ten people out of a hundred respondents will answer exactly the same: \"Janitors!\"?",
