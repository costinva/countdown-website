  "overview": "Joined at the Flip follows Page Turner and DeRon Jenkins, who are busy house flippers in Nashville and Atlanta — and, they also happen to be exes. For this driven former couple, no job is too big, too small or too dirty. With a decade of partnership, this duo knows the real estate game inside and out, and they're willing to fight the market — and maybe each other — to get top dollar and return on their investment.",
