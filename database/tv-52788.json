But its true historical significance lay buried under the desert sands of Iraq, only to be discovered late in the 19th century. In this amazing new documentary, we compare myth with historical fact in order to unmask this fabled city, and bring to life the city's legendary characters and buildings using the latest in 3D motion capture technology based on precise archeological data. We visit the ruins of Babylon in Iraq for the first time since the Iraq War in order to see first hand, the size and scope of this ancient marvel. Through insights from the world's foremost experts and a narrative which is both intriguing and exciting, we draw the viewer into the marvelous world of ancient Babylon.  ",
