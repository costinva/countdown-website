  "overview": "Champion Texas cowboy Jim Sinclair is commissioned to rope animals on the African veldt for a game ranch in Kenya. Along with his faithful Indian companion John Henry, Sinclair undertakes the dangerous experiment vital to emerging Africa. Working for Wing Commander Howard Hayes, an Englishman, Sinclair and John Henry (Nardini) do right well looping everything from elands to buffalo. But they're going to have trouble from another rancher, the sinister Neumann (Frank Marth). He turns out to  be  an  ex-Nazi, of course. Already, a personal war exists between them. Sinclair seems to have enough trouble, but now he's got an adopted Kikuyu boy, Samson, who actually \"adopted\" him while watching him ride a bronc after an impala. \"I will be like you. You are now my father,\" the boy says.",
