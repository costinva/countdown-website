  "overview": "Together with her mother Franka, Lisa moves to the remote town of Großstetten in the Black Forest. Above all, Franka, the town's new police chief, hopes the move will be a fresh start for her daughter. At her old school, the 17-year-old was bullied because of her panic attacks. Whilst Lisa cautiously gets in touch with her new classmates, she witnesses a gruesome suicide at the memorial service for the victims of a rampage at her school. Simon, another student at Großstetten, is confronted by his parents: They have found out that he is gay. Simon's father Karl, pastor of a strict free church community, convinces his son to undergo conversion therapy. While Franka's investigation brings to light some unresolved questions about the suicide, the realm of the dead seems to reach out to Lisa. With her super-sensory gift, Lisa gets closer and closer to the mystery of the creepy apparitions.",
