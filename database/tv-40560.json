  "overview": "A Very British History explores key moments in the 20th century for minority communities across Britain - including the stories of Romany Gypsies around the Home Counties, the Jewish community in Leeds, Afro-Caribbeans in Birmingham, and Ugandan Asians in Leicester and beyond.Fronted by presenters from those communities, the series explores the highs and lows that many faced when making their home in modern Britain. We hear their untold stories and follow emotional journeys back in time. Each film is a quest to discover more about the history of communities in multi-cultural Britain.",
