  "overview": "If you put a game show and a food competition show in a blender, you get Guy's Ultimate Game Night. Hollywood celebrities and their closest friends and family join host Guy Fieri in the Flavortown Lounge for an evening of food, drinks and off-the-hook food-related games and trivia like \"Dish Pics,\" \"The Guy-Q Test,\" and \"Charade the Pantry,\" as well as hands-on food challenges like \"Blind Baker\" and \"Omelette Offs.\" It's all fun and games as the guests must stay on their toes as they battle for crazy prizes, and the best part is, it's all in the name of charity!",
