  "overview": "The laws of physics are absolute. They bind us together, tether us to Earth and govern everything we do, yet we rarely think about them. In the new Science Channel series Outrageous Acts of Danger, adventurer Todd Sampson puts his faith in science to the ultimate test through a series of epic and potentially deadly experiments. This series shows that it is one thing to believe in science, but another to literally trust it with your life. In each of the six 30-minutes episodes, Todd, who once completed an unguided ascent to the top of Mount Everest, puts himself in a death-defying situation, however, the laws of physics dictate that he will escape unscathed. Todd calls upon leading physicists and experts who guarantee that the science behind each experiment is irrefutable, absent of human error.",
