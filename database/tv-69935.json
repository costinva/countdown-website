  "overview": "The Soviet Union is dying before our eyes, but with a premonition of change, freedom from conscience appears, bordering on lawlessness. And friendship and concepts of justice are increasingly mixed with violence and crime. Ordinary schoolboy Andrei, in order to be on the side of power, changes piano etudes and solfeggio for Yura Shatunov's hit \"Gray Night\" and fierce fights in the company of a new friend, school bully Marat. Andrei and Marat are waiting for the first blood, the first love, the first betrayal and the first death. And for someone like Vova, Marat's half-brother, who returned from Afghanistan, a cruel disappointment in ideals and internal restructuring.",
