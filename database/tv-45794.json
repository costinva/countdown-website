We follow them during their years of heavy training to become a fighter pilot in the Royal Dutch Air Force, and we're with them when they finally go on a dangerous mission in the Middle East. We stand close to these friends in their eventful journey to adulthood, we share their camaraderie, their grief, their joy, love, and fear, in times of peace and times of war.",
