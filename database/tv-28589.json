  "overview": "Newlyweds was about a young couple embarking on the perils of married life. Allie is everyone's dream of a young wife: practical, patient, attractive. Peter is the typical young bloke: sporty, easy-going and a bit of a larrikin. Little does the couple realise what lies in wait for them in married life. Their dream of a cosy life of domestic bliss is constantly interrupted by their families and friends.",
