  "overview": "A special comedy series set against dinners, birthdays, wedding anniversaries, christenings, funerals and celebrations, with guests coming together to get to know each other, to reminisce, to argue, but most of all to spread a lot of laughter. So, when food ceases to be just a way of culinary pleasure and becomes a sweet occasion for company, love and security, that's the moment \"Mum's Cake\" arrives at the table\". This cake made by a plain, everyday, ordinary mum, Kaiti Konstantinou, who has set out to become famous over the internet, has a magical power. It soothes everything that distresses us, stresses us or puts us in a tough spot, it makes us let it all go and smile again as we did when we were children.",
