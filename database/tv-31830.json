  "overview": "Using pioneering state-of-the-art technology, Into the Fire offers a previously unseen view of what it's really like to be a fire fighter in Britain today, with exclusive access to West Midlands Fire Service (WMFS), the second busiest fire and rescue service in the UK. The series is filmed almost entirely by the fire crews themselves, using their revolutionary new helmet and body-worn cameras. Into the Fire also follows WMFS firefighters and their colleagues engaged in a wide variety of work designed to keep people and businesses safe.",
