  "overview": "From the wooded peaks of the East Coast's Blue Ridge to Hawaii's tropical Mauna Loa, the mountains are the ultimate retreat for people who want to get away from it all. The gorgeous views, fresh air, and the sheer joy of sitting on top of the world are a few of the elements that draw homeowners to these remote locations. We'll follow families as they search for their oases in the clouds on Mountain Life.",
