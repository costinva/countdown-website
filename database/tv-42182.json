  "overview": "A high-octane physical competition based on the classic playground game of chase co-hosted by NFL superstar sibling trio J.J., T.J. and Derek Watt. Each week, competitors – who are everyday citizens and not professional athletes – vault, dodge, tumble and dive over various epic, three-dimensional moving courses, with one simple goal: \"Don't get caught.\" As competitors progress, they are challenged to take on even more extreme courses and earn points for their performance in each heart-pounding game. ",
