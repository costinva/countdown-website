  "overview": "The German dramedy series Oh Hell focuses on Helene (Mala Emde), who is in her mid-twenties and who is not nicknamed \"Hell\" for nothing. Her life is anything but relaxed, Helen jumps from one job to the next and privately she keeps stumbling into big and small blunders. For example, she helped her parents get divorced. Sometimes she wishes she were like her best friend Maike (Salka Weber), who travels the world and has already had some successes professionally. When she meets the cello teacher Oskar (Edin HasanoviÄ‡), something like consistency seems to develop for the first time. But can \"Hell\" lead a quiet and happy life - and does she even want it?",
