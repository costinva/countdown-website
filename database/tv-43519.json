  "overview": "Ms. Marvel introduces viewers to Kamala, a 16-year old Pakistani American from Jersey City.  An aspiring artist, an avid gamer, and a voracious fan-fiction scribe, she is a huge fan of the Avengers — and one in particular, Captain Marvel. But Kamala has always struggled to find her place in the world — that is until she gets super powers like the heroes she's always looked up to.",
