  "overview": "In Walk the Line, one music act will win a life changing prize pot of £500,000. The musical acts - be they soloists, duos or bands - will take to the stage to perform for the nation, with panellists Gary, Alesha, Dawn and Craig watching on from their front row seats. But to win the money, talent alone isn't enough. The contestants will need nerves of steel as they determine whether to cash out or physically Walk the Line and risk it all to stay in the competition. ",
