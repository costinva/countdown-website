  "overview": "Clifford - at one time, he was just a small puppy, the runt of the litter. Then, Emily Elizabeth's love made him grow big and he became big, red Clifford. But what about before then? Clifford's Puppy Days explores just that. Set in the big city Clifford and Emily Elizabeth lived in before moving to Birdwell Island, Clifford's Puppy Days features Clifford's adventures when he was just a small puppy. The main crew for the series is largely the same of Clifford the Big Red Dog (such as writers and producers), but watch for a brand new cast and new environments for this curious little puppy to explore.",
