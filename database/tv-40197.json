  "overview": "The six-part docuseries also explores Humboldt's marijuana farms - both legal and illegal - and provides a glimpse into what it takes for an outlaw farmer to cross over to the legal market. From describing the history of marijuana in the area to the current role of \"trimmigrants\" -people from out of town who come to work the harvest-, Murder Mountain unravels a place of incredible natural beauty, where marijuana has become the dominant local industry.",
