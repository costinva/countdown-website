  "overview": "It's nearly impossible to imagine a criminal investigation today that doesn't involve forensic science â€“ firearms analysis, bloodstain patterns, footprints. CSI On Trial reveals the shocking lack of scientific validity behind these investigative practices through real-life criminal cases, the stories of the wrongly convicted who are now free, and the believed innocent who remain behind bars.",
