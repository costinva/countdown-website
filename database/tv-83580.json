  "overview": "The fourth instalment of the critically acclaimed and BAFTA winning Narcos series – Amsterdam Narcos. From the 1970s to the early 2000s, the Dutch city of Amsterdam transformed from a liberal countercultural haven into the drugs capital of Europe. What began as a government tolerating the hash trade soon opened the floodgates to organised crime, leaving the police playing catch up as ecstasy and cocaine smuggling followed. Amsterdam fuelled a pipeline of drugs and criminality through British ports, and right across Europe.  As the Dutch underworld exploded and with the drugs trade spiralling out of control, law enforcement resorted to desperate measures in a bid to catch the gangsters. Told through the personal testimony of drug users, manufacturers, traffickers, and the detectives who tried to outsmart them, Amsterdam Narcos charts how underground rebellion escalated into an increasingly lethal, multi-billion-pound industry. ",
