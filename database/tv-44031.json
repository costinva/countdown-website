  "overview": "The Big Bake is a larger-than-life holiday baking competition series with themed Halloween, holiday and spring episodes. In each episode, three professional baking teams have five hours to design, bake and decorate a grand-scale cake creation based on a particular theme. These bakers need to think big and bold, blowing up their designs to gigantic proportions and thinking outside the (bakery) box. In the end, the most ambitious, eye-popping and delicious cake will go home with a $10,000 prize.",
