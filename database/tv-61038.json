  "overview": "22 riders. 18 races. Only one winner. The FIM MotoGPâ„¢ World Championship is the ultimate fusion between human and machine. Every year from March to November, these athletes ride their motorbikes at speeds close to 350 kph with just one goal: to be the first across the finish line. But there's more to this sport than just the 40-minute stretch of the race.",
