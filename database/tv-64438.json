  "overview": "When on October 4, 1992, a Boeing 747 of the Israeli airline company El Al crashes into an apartment building in Amsterdam's Bijlmermeer, the Netherlands is suddenly world news. The investigation into the cause shows that a safety pin has come loose from one of the engines. Just very unlucky. Fortunately, it was a freight plane with only perfume, flowers and computer parts on board, says The Hague. The black box cannot be found. After a period of national mourning, the Netherlands is returning to business as usual.",
