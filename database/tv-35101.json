  "overview": "The main heroine of the series is the young ballerina Julia. Her mother - a choreographer - prepares her girl for selection for foreign theater tours. In the past, her mother left her career because of her daughter. Julia will be her mother's triumph. Failure is tantamount to death. An unsuccessful suicide attempt by the heroine results in a fateful meeting with a young man, who because of her, was late for his own wedding. This meeting not only changes the fate of both of them, but also brings unexpected discoveries: about the future, in which victories and careers are not the most important thing, and about the past in which their parents once loved each other.
