  "overview": "Ten years after college, \"Pitch Perfect\" hero Bumper Allen lives a boring existence working as a security guard for his alma mater and singing a cappella as a hobby with the less-than-enthusiastic Tonehangers. But after a surprise phone call from his old acquaintance Pieter, Bumper is convinced he can make his musical dreams of becoming a pop star come true by dropping everything and moving to Berlin. With the help of an entourage of German collaborators, Bumper's goal is to perform a hit single at the famous German Unity Day. As Bumper grows into the musical artist he's always wanted to be, he finds long-lost confidence and romance along the way.",
