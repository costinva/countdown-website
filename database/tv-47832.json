  "overview": "Hero High was a cartoon series created by Filmation that aired as part of the Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam! It was about a high school where young superheroes were taught how to use their powers and fight crime. Originally intended to be a new entry in Filmation's long-running line of Archie cartoon series, the 1981 series was altered at the last minute because the company's rights to the \"Archie\" characters had expired; nevertheless, one can easily tell which was originally the Archie character, the Reggie character, etc.",
