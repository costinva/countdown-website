  "overview": "Secrets from the Asylum follows several celebrities as they try to find out why their ancestors had spent time within the asylum. The asylum was seen as a place of stigma and shame. However, asylums hoped to help people be restored to a first-class citizen to be able to live in the real world again. What had actually followed after leaving the asylum was a life-time of shame, guilt, secrets and lies.",
