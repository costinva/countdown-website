  "overview": "Bear Grylls has spent his entire career rescuing himself - and others - from death in some of the most dangerous parts of the world. Now, instead of sacrificing himself in the wild to teach survival skills, he's turning the tables to America's armchair adventurers by creating wilderness simulated challenges that will test the contestants' smarts, physicality and their ability to adapt and do whatever it takes to survive - including having to eat and drink some truly gnarly survival food.This show gives rookie survivors the chance to prove their mettle at the hands of one of the world's leading adventurers. Along the way, a few lucky leading contestants will have a chance to earn the hard-fought reward of a seat on the larger-than-life MTN DEW-branded throne.",
