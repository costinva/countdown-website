  "overview": "Construction Fails happen every day, but sometimes the damage is catastrophic. This factual, fast-paced show investigates the most spectacular mishaps, what went wrong, and how the disaster could have been averted. Combining live footage with CGI animation, this show examines well-known disasters, such as the Notre Dame fire, and the collapse of the Georgia Dome, but also more minor incidents. Presented in a light-hearted and accessible manner, Construction Fails shows what happens when things go drastically wrong.",
