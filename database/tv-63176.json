  "overview": "As far back as Julia Saurel can remember, she's had a difficult relationship with her father. Three days before she is supposed to get married, she receives a phone call – just as she had predicted, her father will not be able to attend her wedding. For once, Julia has to admit he has a really good excuse – he just died. Julia cannot help seeing the tragi-comic side of the situation. Her nuptial dreams transform into funeral plans and even from the grave, it seems her father Michel has his own particularly effective way of disrupting his daughter's life. But the day after his funeral, Julia discovers that her father has one last surprise in store for her when a tall wooden crate is delivered to her home – inside it is a life-size android, a carbon copy of her father.",
