  "overview": "Open Bar, based on Fabcaro's albums, features a gallery of characters that are a priori classic but here always a little borderline when they are grappling with the daily life of Western civilization. Situations that get out of hand under the effect of surrealist reactions thus revealing the absurdity of human existence in areas of high urban concentration.",
