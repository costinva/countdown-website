  "overview": "Amy Sedaris cordially invites you into her home, where she will show off diverse but necessary homemaking skills, from creating popsicle-stick buddies and gutting a fish to making raisin necklaces and entertaining businessmen. As always, Amy will use her unique expertise to entertain guests, demonstrate her know-how by preparing meals and exhibit her can-do spirit by attempting to work out personal issues. Remember, if you want to be the perfect host, accentuate the positives and medicate the negatives.",
