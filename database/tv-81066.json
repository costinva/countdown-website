  "overview": "Nearly 40 years after his summertime reign of terror on the streets of Los Angeles, the myth of the \"Night Stalker\" still looms large. Now, a series of prison recordings of Richard Ramirez unearths new truths in the Peacock original docuseries Richard Ramirez: The Night Stalker Tapes.   Collected from more than 25 hours of audio recordings – most of which have never been heard before – and including revealing interviews with his family, friends and wife, the series explores the dark forces that led Ramirez to become the infamous Night Stalker.   Plus, some of the women impacted by Ramirez over the years share their experiences, from former friends to victims' families, and his own niece, who speaks out for the first time in a documentary. The series also goes inside the confounding love story of a former teen magazine editor who fell in love with Ramirez and eventually became his wife. ",
