  "overview": "Aussie Millions features three major events - the $100K Challenge, the Heads Up Championship and the Aussie Millions Main Event - aired across 10 episodes. The world's largest tournament event, the $100K Challenge features 24 of the world's biggest (and richest) players, with the poker elite represented by Phil Ivey, Howard Lederer, Gus Hansen, Tony G, Barry Greenstein, Tony Bloom, Tom Dwan, Chris Ferguson, John Juanda, Erick Lindgren and Jeffrey Lisandro. Viewed by many as the purest form of poker, Heads Up is played one on one with each round being the best of three matches. Highly competitive, the tournament reveals the psychology of the game as competitors try to out-wit, out-stare and out-draw their opponents. For one of the richest prizes in poker, a field of 746 players anted up the AUD$10,500 buy-in for the Main Event, creating a prize pool of AUD$7.46 million with $2m going to the winner. The Aussie Millions Poker Championship tournament is held at the Crown Casino, Melbourne's premier entertainment complex, which covers the equivalent of two city blocks.",
