  "overview": "The project participants are used to living a glamorous life, which they are happy to share with millions of their subscribers. They can easily fly to Dubai by private jet for the weekend, drive around Moscow in expensive cars and eat in the most luxurious Michelin-starred restaurants. TNT decided to check what is behind these perfect pictures and whether those who are not used to serious work know their history, remember their roots and can take off their luxury masks to ground themselves and live the most honest and environmentally friendly life. The TV channel will send the stars of social networks to the village for re-education in order to bring them down from heaven to earth and show the real life of many people who earn their living by hard work and do not throw money down the drain. The unique format of the project was developed by the TV channel's team. The participants of the reality show are waiting for fun challenges, trials, which are everyday duties for ordinary villagers. The heroes of social networks are waiting for dirty work, which they have never faced before. Time will tell whether they will be able to avoid this dirt and remain the idols of the generation.",
