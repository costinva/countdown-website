  "overview": "You are never alone. Your movements are constantly monitored, as are your choices and opinions. Everything is registered and monitored. How easy is it to take over your digital life? And how easy would it be for an attacker to take over companies and authorities in Sweden? The series Hackad is an experiment where hackers tricks their way into companies and take over their networks. We get to see how easy it is to follow every trace that a private person leaves behind and how easy it can be to make payments in someone else's name.",
