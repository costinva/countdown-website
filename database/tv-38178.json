  "overview": "A \"small\" new student, Ushio Hinomaru, appears before the weak little sumo club of Oodachi High School. The words \"big\" and \"heavy\" are the rules to this sport, which does not fit this newbie one bit, but Ushio surprises everyone. Ushio and the small sumo club climbs its way to the top with a goal to reach the highest rank, Hinoshita Kaisan.",
