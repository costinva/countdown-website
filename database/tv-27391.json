  "overview": "The Food Truck follows Michael Van De Elzen, owner and head chef of Molten Restaurant and Liquid Molten Bar in Mt Eden, Auckland, as he attempts to create healthy, restaurant-quality alternatives to New Zealand fast food favourites from the back of a 1970 Bedford truck.In The Food Truck, Michael, a secret admirer of fast food himself, uses his 25 years of experience in the kitchen to try his hand at creating healthy and delicious alternatives to some of the nation's most beloved takeaways; from fish and chips, to hamburgers, pizzas to pies. While he sometimes draws on the resources of his restaurant, for the most part Michael's forced to cook within the constraints of his 1970 Bedford truck fitted with an everyday domestic kitchen, leaving little room for mistake.The climax of the show comes when Michael takes The Food Truck to a different event or gathering with hundreds or even thousands of people, from campsites to sports events, concerts to festivals. Here he gets to find out whether kiwis really want his healthy creations when they're asked to decide with their wallets. Part cooking show and part factual series about the fast paced, highly competitive world of fast food.",
