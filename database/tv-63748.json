  "overview": "A famed exorcist named Yangyao is hired by those with wealth and recognition to ask for his services in eliminating spirits by using painting skills. But even though he is capable of doing this alone, there are some cases where he must ask for the assistance of his friend Yan'an, a winemaker. When Yangyao senses that something is not right in his town, he uses his knowledge and skill to expose those who are dishonest to others.",
