  "overview": "This investigative documentary follows two women as they work to unravel the mysterious disappearances that tormented the Lewis Clark Valley in the 1980s. Investigators are certain who the killer is, but no one has been able to gather enough evidence to confidently prosecute him. This \"Person of Interest\" is alive and living as a free man today. Now Detective Jackie Nichols and Gloria Bobertz enter the scene. Nichols and Bobertz dust off the case files, track down old witnesses and pursue new leads.",
