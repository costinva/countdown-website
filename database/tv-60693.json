  "overview": "What will happen if, as a result of biological warfare, almost the entire male population dies out? Women will get excited (not for long), and then they will unite and create a new better world — with eco-towns, renewable energy, opportunities to do whatever they want, even science and biohacking, even yoga and self-development. Reproduction now takes place by artificial insemination, and only girls are born in the new world.But not everyone likes such a world order. Some of the surviving men and women loyal to them go to live in abandoned megacities, start stealing electricity, enjoying freedom and traditional sex. The tranquility of the perfectly arranged female world is under threat when the teacher Rada from the eco-city \"Two Hills\" meets a young \"primate\" Hera outside of it.",
