  "overview": "The Chop: Britain's Top Woodworker sees 10 of the country's finest carpenters gather in Epping Forest to whittle, carve and chop their way to the final, to see who will be crowned Britain's Top Woodworker and the chance to stage their own personal exhibition at the prestigious William Morris Gallery in London. Master Carpenter William Hardie oversees the construction of a grand and spectacular cabin in the woods, adding a new room every week, each on a different historical theme, including Nelson's cabin on HMS Victory, a Victorian pub, a Gothic bedroom, a Georgian hunting lodge, and a 1960s' Mad Men-inspired lounge. The contestants are tasked with creating amazing items and artefacts to furnish the rooms whilst expert guest judges with specialist knowledge of the different historical eras help Lee, Rick and William decide who progresses to the next round and which will get the chop. Week by week the cabin evolves to become a living museum of what is possible in woodwork.  ",
