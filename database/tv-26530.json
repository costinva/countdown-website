  "overview": "Have you ever wondered what happens to your home once you move out? Will the new owners keep your beloved hand-painted mural on the nursery wall? What is the fate of the all-pink bathroom you so adored? How about the vintage 1950s kitchen you cherished for all of those years? When new homeowners move into your old home, they could love it all or rip it all out without much thought! What would you do if you could actually see what they did to undo the blood, sweat and tears invested in your home? Now Moving Up gives you the chance! Moving Up, a series hosted by noted and charismatic TLC personality Doug Wilson, returns for a second season. We follow a chain of new homeowners who move into one another's homes and begin the design and renovation process. They all have plenty to say about their new digs and the unappealing design demons the past owners left behind! They'll work tirelessly to make their new house their home with numerous design choices and big renovations to implement. After the renovations are complete, the old homeowners will get the rare chance to visit their once beloved homes and see all of the new changes. Will they happily approve of what they see or will they wish that they had never come back? Taste is tested in Moving Up, and host Doug Wilson is there to invoke fond memories, humorous observations and cantankerous commentary every step of the way!",
