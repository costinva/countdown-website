  "overview": "Living on the Edge goes inside the lives of (e.g.) a group of grey seals, shell ducks and a family of peregrine falcons in the Wadden Sea, a sea which changes completely over the seasons or even a couple of times per day. At one moment, it is kilometers of extensive tidal flats full of life and at another a mass of water with reckless waves; all tied to the invisible influence of the moon and the sun on the tides.",
