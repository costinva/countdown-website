  "overview": "A love-story between a noble woman and a mysterious man who shows up in her hometown set in the 1600s during the Qing invasion. Yu Gil Chae is a pretty, bubbly and a bit spoiled young lady who's named as the 99 tailed fox of Neunggun-ri. She is a bit of an outcast too because other young ladies are jealous of her. They seem to think she's too straight forward and her behavior is inappropriate for a young lady while young noble men think highly of her. Gil Chae knows how to get men to fall for her but fails to capture the heart of the person she likes. Lee Jang Hyun is a mysterious man who suddenly appears in the Neunggun-ri social scene one day. Nobody really knows about him. Young nobles don't like him while he has elderly people wrapped around his finger. He's been dating around a lot but becomes curious about a certain 99 tailed fox. And one day, the said fox crash lands to his arm literally. With the brewing war, the pair find themselves separated even before they start to make sense of their feelings.  ",
