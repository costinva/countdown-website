  "overview": "Nadiuska was an important actress during the 1970s in Spain. This documentary is based in real facts about her role in the development of the 'destape' era of Spanish filming industry that transformed Nadiuska from a poor immigrant to the biggest star but not without its downs and shadows. Her life was full of hurdles and the film Establishment, the political, royalty and even the press that launched her carrer had a field day destroying her. If you enjoyed \"Veneno\" you are going to love this story even more. ",
