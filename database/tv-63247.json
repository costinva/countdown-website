  "overview": "In 1992, 22-year-old rising telenovela star Daniella Perez, dubbed \"Brazil's Sweetheart,\" went missing after a day on set, prompting a desperate search throughout Rio de Janeiro. After locating the actress' body, police zero in on her co-star Guilherme de Pádua, whose unhealthy obsession with Perez quickly sparks an international media frenzy. As bizarre and alarming details emerge, Daniella's mother, screenwriter Glória Perez, begins a decades-long fight for justice – not only for her own daughter, but for all victims of violent crime.",
