  "overview": "In the Russian Empire, before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, \nlandowners were entitled to own serfs to farm their land. Serfs were for\n most purposes considered the property of the landowner, and could be \nbought, sold or mortgaged, as any other chattel. To count serfs (and \npeople in general), the measure word \"soul\" was used: e.g., \"six souls \nof serfs\". The plot of the novel relies on \"dead souls\" (i.e., \"dead \nserfs\") which are still accounted for in property registers. On another \nlevel, the title refers to the \"dead souls\" of Gogol's characters, all \nof which visualise different aspects of poshlost (an untranslatable \nRussian word which is perhaps best rendered as \"self-satisfied \ninferiority\", moral and spiritual, with overtones of middle-class \npretentiousness, fake significance and philistinism).",
