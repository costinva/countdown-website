  "overview": "Good moral values, children and magic are the three indispensable elements of Wansapanataym (Filipinization of the English phrase \"once upon a time\"), a weekly fantasy anthology for kids produced by the ABS-CBN Network. Using magical stories to gain the attention of young viewers, the show has effectively inculcated values for children in its ten years on air. With an average 32.2% nation-wide audience share in the past six months alone, and from positive feedback on social networking sites, Wansapanataym has proven that Filipinos still have a high regard for old-school values and wholesome programming despite today's modern lifestyle.",
