  "overview": "Like every dog, Fík was a sweet little puppy at first. But he grows so fast and to such a size that he becomes the terror of the neighborhood. Inside, however, he is truly kind and clever. His adventures start at home with his family, then continue at school where he is an exemplary pupil, and afterward out in the wide world. He sails the seas, flies a plane, visits Africa and the Polar Circle and returns home an experienced traveler.",
