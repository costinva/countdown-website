  "overview": "\"Even if this universe is truly nothing more than a brutal bloody shadowy forest, we Cultivators will burn all that we have just to give off a single weak flickering spark in the darkness! \"No matter how weak each spark is, how short-lived, how smallâ€¦ As long as the sparks flow unabated, then one day one of those sparks will light some tinder, and that tinder shall light some fallen branches, and those branches shall set ablaze each and every last tree of the forest! \"In the end, even the smallest sparks will eventually set the shadowy forest ablaze and illuminate the whole world!\" (NovelUpdate) In a world teeming with cultivators, Li Yao, who makes his living collecting scrap metal, encounters the soul of a titan powerhouse from forty thousand years in the past.",
