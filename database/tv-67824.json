  "overview": "Khondiao is engaged to Yi because of a mutually beneficial business agreement. The sweet love of Yi and Khondiao is like the ending of a romance novel. As if! Khondiao is left alone on the engagement day. He's left alone when he moves into Yi's place. As the wedding ceremony is around the corner, he has to deal with everything alone â€¦ His name is Khondiao, but it doesn't mean he wants to be alone! As the distress is no longer bearable, Khondiao decides to flee from the future wedding to Switzerland, not suspecting Yi will try to catch up with him and get into a car accident. What's more, Yi loses his memory when he wakes up and accuses Khondiao of being the one despising the idea of getting married!",
