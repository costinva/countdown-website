  "overview": "When his failure to intervene in a violent confrontation in a playground brings his identity crisis to a head, John ups and moves his family to the rural idyll of Coldwater, as far away from London as possible.Upon arrival, John is quickly befriended by next-door neighbour Tommy, a charming, confident man, devoted husband to the local vicar Rebecca. He is a man of faith, a pillar of the community and self-appointed leader of the village's all-male book group. Â John is both impressed and slightly fascinated by Tommy. His wife Fiona despises him. As a successful former chef hoping to launch a new venture in Coldwater, Fiona sees the move as an opportunity to leave the past behind them. To not only re-build their lives as a family but re-ignite the long-lost spark in their fading marriage. When her husband's relationship with their enigmatic new neighbour becomes increasingly intense, Fiona's suspicions are aroused. She is unconvinced Tommy is all he seems to be.But John remains blissfully unaware that Tommy is harbouring horrifying secrets, and it's only after a series of unsettling incidents start to occur that John begins to wonder who the real Tommy actually is.",
