  "overview": "Four contestants compete each evening for the right to call themselves \"cleverdicks\" and play for a cash jackpot. As explained by host Widdecombe at the top of the first episode, a cleverdick is a person who is \"irritatingly and ostentatiously knowledgeable or intelligent\". The question material is primarily academic in nature.",
