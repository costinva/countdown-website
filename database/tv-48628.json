During this time, Go Eun Sub, the half-brother, befriends Jung Eun and against his better judgment falls in love with his brother's \"fianc√©e.\" What ensues is a heart-wrenching love triangle that is complicated by the three characters' love for one another that transcends any love they may feel for their heart's desire.",
