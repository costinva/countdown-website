  "overview": "Can a woman who can't remember her past and a man who is trying to hide his true identity break a swim team's losing streak? Yu Die (Mandy Wei) was a genius child prodigy who lost everything she loved. Yu Die's mother drowned while trying to save Yu Die and, in one very bad day, Yu Die lost her mother, her memory and her ability to swim. Years later, she crosses paths with Gao Hai Fei (Kingone Wang), the CEO of a multibillion corporation. Intrigued by Yu Die's lost memories, Hai Fei hides his true identity from her and gets mistaken for a professional part-time worker who is a jack-of-all-trades. Yu Die asks Hai Fei for his help with the \"Sea Horse\" Men's Swim Team, which has never been able to win a meet and is the laughing stock of the sport of swimming. With Hai Fei searching for a \"mermaid\" crush from his past, will he agree to help Yu Die turn the losing swim team?",
