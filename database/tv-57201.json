  "overview": "Space inspires awe and wonder, but it also can be scary... and lethal. Supermassive black holes, deadly gamma-ray bursts, rogue asteroids, dark energy, supernovas... Our world is under attack from above. It's like a ticking time bomb. Killers of the Cosmos takes a film-noir approach to these threats, mixing scripted, animated drama with top experts in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, biology, cosmology, and planetary science.Aidan Gillen steps in as our gumshoe detective. In each episode, he's got a case to solve, with a different killer to identify and track down. But first, he needs evidence. Aided by a mysterious informant, he investigates each disaster-in-the-making via a wide range of experts who've studied some of science's most unbelievable wonders.Â ",
