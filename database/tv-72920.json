  "overview": "The charming Serkan, who calls himself a descendant of the Turkish sultans, and the young St. Petersburg woman Anna team up to commit the \"crime of the century.\" Anya works as an assistant in an expensive event agency for a symbolic salary, complemented by access to the city's high society. There she meets a representative of a noble Ottoman family who came to St. Petersburg in search of a Russian wife. Anya's roots are not easy either - her father, a swindler, is in prison, from where he can be pulled out for a lot of money. The girl decides to commit a crime: she steals a precious necklace from Serkan's collection, but very quickly finds out that the necklace is a fake, as is the title of the Sultan. Serkan is a swindler who, Anya is forced to admit, has extraordinary charm. The Turk, caught in a forgery, is forced to take Anya as a share in order to further \"cheat\" the rich people of St. Petersburg and not only with an energetic girl and her freed father.",
