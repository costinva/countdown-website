  "overview": "Like Mother, Like Daughter? follows six pairs of mothers and daughters who embark on a three-week retreat to address their broken relationships. Emotions run high as healing these relationships exposes long-kept secrets, reopening old wounds and revealing deep seated issues. With the help of mental health experts Dr. Cynthia Powell-Hicks and Dr. Allycin Powell-Hicks -- a mother/daughter duo themselves who can uniquely relate to the dynamics -- the women work together to address trauma and cultivate the skills necessary to have a healthy, loving relationship with each other. For some, this journey may seem impossible and for others, it's a life changing experience.",
