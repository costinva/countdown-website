  "overview": "Stories of eight women who did not live simple, serene or happy lives. They faced violent partners, manipulative parents, hostile bosses, and humiliating situations. They all tried unsuccessfully to improve their lives. Without the resources or psychological help, they reached their limit, and jail or death seemed less frightening than continuing to endure their situation.",
