  "overview": "Five Guys a Week transforms the first-date experience into the ultimate test of romance, compatibility and stamina by providing one single girl with five trial live-in boyfriends for a week â€“ all at the same time.The locally-sourced lads, all meeting her exacting standards, will jostle for supremacy as they compete for the girl's admiration from the moment they set foot across her threshold. They will go everywhere with her en masse: whether that's to her job, out with her mates, or for dinner with her parents, with a combination of fixed rig and roaming cameras following all the action. There is only one rule - the girl must eliminate four of the guys by the end of the week, whittling them down to the last man standing.",
