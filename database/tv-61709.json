  "overview": "South of the River, a new docuseries to be shown on BT Sport, explores the exponential rise of players from the area and takes an unflinching look at the associated social problems including knife crime, gang culture and funding cuts. Champions League winning captain Rio Ferdinand, who was raised on a Peckham council estate, is an executive producer. The three-part series features Premier League players from London's most prosperous catchment area, but it's the disarmingly candid and heartfelt testimonies from those aspiring to follow in their role model's footsteps that makes it essential viewing. The tragic dichotomy between earning a contract and falling into crime is a prevailing theme and the statistics reveal the horrifying extent of this scourge.",
