  "overview": "Dating can be a stressful experience when it's just two people enjoying some private time together. Add in a TV crew and a national TV audience watching the date and the stress level -- and awkwardness -- goes up significantly. Each episode of Date Night Live gives viewers a fly-on-the-wall look at up to nine dates taking place in real time in cities across America. In-studio hosts bounce around from city to city, offering their own commentary on all the awkward conversations and cringe-worthy moments they witness while checking in with each pair of daters. Some dates go well while others crash and burn, but regardless of the outcome viewers get to see it all unfold as it happens.",
