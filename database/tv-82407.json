  "overview": "Trains, planes or maritime travel â€“ innumerable travellers use these junctions that catapult them to new adventures every day. What kind of planning and logistics are necessary to make the commute, the flight, the trip of millions and millions of individuals possible at all? What goes on behind the scenes to insure that everyone gets where they need to go in a timely manner? Giant Hubs will take the viewer behind the scenes of this almost impossible endeavour and find answers to these and to a lot more questions.",
