  "overview": "Rural forests and meadows aren't the only places wildlife thrives. Our urban centers are filled with exotic animals in some of the most unlikely locations, often hidden from the casual observer. From back alleys to swamps, our major cities sometimes include resident giant snakes, large snails, boars armed with razor-sharp tusks, endangered sea turtles and unusual birds.With the help of local experts and residents, Mireya Mayor tracks down creatures adapted to city life by trekking through urban swamps, lagoons, traffic-heavy streets, hidden passageways and shopping districts. Along the way Mireya discovers a surprisingly diverse range of animals, including giant Burmese pythons and feral hogs, in three iconic cities.",
