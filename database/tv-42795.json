  "overview": "Out There with Jack Randall follows Jack in the Australian outback as he fearlessly searches for exotic, endangered and iconic species in some of the most unforgiving environments on the planet. In this adrenaline-filled series, Jack literally goes to the ends of the Earth to go nose to nose with nature's creepy crawlies and wild beasts. He dives into crocodile-infested swamps, crawls through cramped caves laden with bats to find a rare 12-ft python and experiences a fair share of bites from 'grumpy' wild animals along the way.",
