  "overview": "Secrets of the Bunny Ranch pulls back the curtain on the inner workings of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, exploring the impact the infamous brothel had on the women who worked there. At the center of the Bunny Ranch was owner Dennis Hof, viewed by his supporters as a prostitution liberator who worked to destigmatize the profession.  Featuring interviews with former Bunny Ranch workers—many speaking for the first time—the documentary reveals how women drawn in by the promise of a better life through the glamourous world portrayed on Cathouse instead allege they faced a hidden reality marked by bullying, humiliation, manipulation, sexual assault and even murder. Other episodes explore topics including a detailed account of former professional basketball player Lamar Odom's near-death experience from those who were there and Dennis Hof's political ambitions vying for a seat in the state assembly. With never-before-seen footage, personal photos, and unprecedented access to ex-employees and Cathouse crew members, the series exposes a far more complicated legacy of Dennis Hof and the Bunny Ranch than the carefree image portrayed on television.",
