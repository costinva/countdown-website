  "overview": "Nick Cannon pushed the envelope with \"Wild N' Out\" and it was a hit, so we asked for more. Does that make us geniuses or just crazy? Either way, what he's come up with now is gonna make you laugh. Nick Cannon Presents: Short Circuitz is made up of the same innovative and explosive comedy that's makes \"Wild N' Out\" so addictive and hilarious. But instead of one-liners and improv raps, Nick's brought in a crew to deliver the laughs in a rapid-fire collection of fake TV Shows, phony news reports, off-the-wall commercial parodies, dead-on celebrity impressions and much more in what Nick calls, \"A.D.D. TV.",
