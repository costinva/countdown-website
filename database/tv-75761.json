  "overview": "What would you do if you accidentally found yourself inside the world of a script, playing the role of a tragic female lead used and discarded by the villainous male lead, even tortured to death? For Song Xiaoyu, the answer is obvious: run as far away as possible. She had the perfect escape plan, but reality said otherwise. Every time she tries to change the storyline or marry a supporting male character, she becomes trapped in a never-ending loop full of \"bugs,\" dying in 108 unique and absurd ways. In short, the game was over for her the moment it began. Eventually, Xiaoyu comes to a painful realization: no matter how hard she tries, the \"plot\" always pulls her back to the male lead, Nan Heng, forcing her to re-enact the script's iconic scenes again and again. In this paper-thin world, so many characters are shackled by predestined roles. Some are imprisoned in palace intrigues, others are confined in grand aristocratic mansions. Some are trapped in toxic rivalries among women, while others endlessly pursue power and status. Some yearn for love and freedom but can only dance in fear, bound by invisible chains. Some dream of soaring like mighty birds, only to lose their spirit amid the monotony of daily life. This drama portrays the struggle of ordinary individuals fighting against a fate that was scripted from the very beginning.Â ",
