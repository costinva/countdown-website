  "overview": "Each week on Bake It Like Buddy, two extremely talented, passionate and creative baking family duos face-off against each other in a fun head-to-head bake off at Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken, New Jersey. The contestants, spanning from professionals to emerging chefs to passionate weekend bakers, will have every fiber of their baking abilities tested as Buddy sets a unique challenge in each episode. With help from his own family and Carlo's Bakery staff, Buddy and two members of his team mentor and judge the visiting family's delicious creations on design, flavor, technique, finish and how well the contestants followed a central theme -- ranging from unicorns, sci-fi, 3D, Halloween and much more! The two teams have only four hours to design, bake, and decorate a cake for the chance to win a $1,000 cash prize, professional baking supplies and most importantly, bragging rights!",
