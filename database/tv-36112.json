  "overview": "Flight Lieutenant Harrison has been assigned from London to find out whether he should recommend that a Nuclear Command Bunker near the picturesque fishing village of Auchnacluchnie should be closed. Auchnacluchnie has a nice pub where the landlord Iain Guthrie and lovely daughter Eilidh Guthrie live and work. Eilidh is a teacher in Auchnacluchnie and has a boyfriend. Will that stop Flight Lieutenant Harrison from trying to win her affection? Will the base that should house 300 now down to 3 be closed or not? The three being Wing-Commander Campbell-Stokes, an old-school military man who still thinks he's fighting the Communists; Flight Lieutenant Harrison the only sane one among them and Airman Tench who doesn't think at all.",
