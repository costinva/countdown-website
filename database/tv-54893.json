  "overview": "This documentary project explores the character of different American states and cities through the stories of their people, history, culture, and food. Our documentary series of 24-minute episodes showcases the uniqueness of each place and aims at breaking down popular stereotypes about America. We'll take our viewers on a tour beyond major tourist routes and introduce them to the people who represent the best of the American character: self-made problem solvers, innovators, thinkers, and role models. Our special focus in each episode will be on strong female characters, the stories of successful immigrants, on diversity and the LGBT community.",
