  "overview": "The cat in a box, is it dead or alive? Schr√∂dinger, a quantum physicist, asked the question. He answered that the cat is simultaneously both dead and alive. It paved a path to paradox. The monk in the house seeks after the truth in quantum physics. The time for the stars to bloom, the sunset when the flowers fall, the moment when light disappears in darkness, how do they exist in the same landscape? His question becomes spiral stairs.",
