  "overview": "Grime artist Big Zuu has a hidden talent – he's also a great cook. His only professional experience may have been six months working the grill at Nando's, but now, this self-taught chef is hitting the road with his old school mates Tubsey and Hyder, looking to cook up amazing dishes in the back of his very own food truck for a selection of the UK's favourite comedians.As a musician, Zuu knows all about the difficulties of finding good food on tour – but how does the comedy circuit compare? In this series he's meeting top comics - including Jimmy Carr, Josh Widdicombe, Jamali Maddix and London Hughes - to cook them the perfect post-gig rider, ready for when they come off stage.And for each meal he adds his own signature twist – from using Doritos as a topping on fried chicken, to cramming an entire roast dinner into a Yorkshire pudding sandwich – this is cooking like you've never seen it before, but will it be enough for some of the biggest names in British comedy?",
