  "overview": "Renowned top body language and behavioral analysts, Mark Bowden, Greg Hartley, Chase Hughes, and Scott Rouse, collectively known as The Behavior Panel, bring their expertise to Merit Street. For years they have provided the military, law enforcement, and Fortune 500 companies with expert interpretation of the gestures, fidgets, posture, and speech patterns that reveal human behavior. From YouTube, where videos amassed over 4M views, the panel's weekly show will analyze the news conferences, interviews, and public appearances by headline-makers that capture worldwide attention. Viewers will learn the signs of dishonesty and deception to keep them safe. One-hour episodes air Fridays at 4PM ET.",
