  "overview": "East Harbour Heroes is a saltwater-soaked journey to St. John's, N.L., where a vibrant community of tough individuals battle the rugged coast and the North Atlantic Ocean to live and work on the edge of the world. From brutal storms, high winds, and changing fish populations, each day brings a new challenge to commercial fishers, stevedores, crane operators, welders, and tugboat operators, and these warriors are determined to thrive â€“ no matter what Mother Nature throws at them.",
