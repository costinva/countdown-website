  "overview": "This two-part series follows the late Paul O'Grady as he travels through Thailand and Laos to celebrate the wonderful work done by elephant conservation centres to rescue, rehabilitate and protect these most majestic, but vulnerable, of animals. Filmed in the months before his sudden and unexpected death, this was Paul's final TV project and one that he was incredibly passionate about.Thailand has the largest number of elephant rescue centres in the world, while Laos is nicknamed the ‘land of a million elephants', and in each episode, Paul travels across the region to roll up his sleeves and muck in to help out at a different rescue centre.  Along the way, Paul also heads out from the sanctuaries to grab a slice of local life by exploring nearby colourful markets, temples and apothecaries and trying local cuisine.  The series highlights challenges faced by elephants in the region and as ever, Paul's love for animals shines throughout. The tone is warm, playful and heartfelt and always characterised by his much-loved wit and humour.  ",
