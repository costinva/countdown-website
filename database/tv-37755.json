  "overview": "A woman of unequaled beauty, Konno Izumi's (Nanao) looks cannot be \ndescribed by words. With a perfectly balanced body and a lovable face, \nshe turns the heads of all men that she passes by, and not only do the \nmen turn around, but they are struck by a cupid and his arrow, who will \nmost definitely come chasing after Izumi to ask her out. No is not an \nanswer for these men, and they will risk anything to obtain the chance \nto be Izumi's significant other. For this reason, Izumi is unable to \nlive an ordinary life, having to hide away from society, spending her \ndays in solitude.\nAkamatsu Keisuke is a student at a university of the arts who ends up \nsubstituting a painting class under art professor Aoyama Jin in exchange\n for credits. He is rather shy and reserved, and like all other men who \nmeet Izumi, falls victim to her beauty. He tries to keep his feelings to\n himself but is unsuccessful. Izumi, on the other hand, is having an \naffair with Jin the professor, but her feelings for him are unrequited.",
