  "overview": "Phil, Vincent, Mel, Carl and Vanessa, now in their thirties, reunite following the death of their old friend Mathieu, who was part of their once tight-knit gang back in high school. During the funeral wake organized at the deceased's parents' house, the old friends remember with nostalgia the epic party that took place there in 2005. With hindsight, they realize that this evening with the scent of peach schnapps marked their lives in many ways.",
