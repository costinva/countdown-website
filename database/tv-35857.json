  "overview": "Buy It Now invites individual sellers to showcase their product to an audience of potential customers. Pitching anything from toys to clothes to gadgets, each seller has only 90 seconds to get the customers interested – and retain them when they reveal the price of their product – as the customers will be parting with their personal money for the product.This audience are in effect a market research group for a handful of professional buyers for large, well-known retail organisations who are watching the seller and the customers. If the seller makes a sale to the audience they get the opportunity to do business with the retailers, if not they are spun off the revolving stage, making way for the next seller.",
