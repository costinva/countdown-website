  "overview": "Sam and John Ibrahim organise the street but lose each other in their ascent to power. Last King of the Cross tracks John Ibrahim's rise from a poverty-stricken immigrant with no education, no money, and no prospects, to Australia's most infamous nightclub mogul in Sydney's Kings Cross â€” a mini-Atlantic City, barely half a mile long with every form of criminality on offer.",
