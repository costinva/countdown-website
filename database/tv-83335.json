  "overview": "Fresh graduate Yooha struggles to find a job and takes on gig work to become independent. Meanwhile, workaholic Minwoo, tired of marriage pressure, hires a fake boyfriend for a month. Yooha, exhausted from difficult clients, accepts Minwoo's high-paying offerâ€”with three simple rules: secrecy, two meetings per week, and answering calls when needed. Their contract is clear, but as they continue the act, pretend feelings start to feel real.",
