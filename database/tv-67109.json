  "overview": "The inside story of the most gripping, heart-stopping, tense and nerve-racking police investigations, stings and taskforce operations in recent memory, told by the men and women who broke the case and were there when it all came crashing down. Using video and sound captured by the New South Wales Police Media Unit, combined with surveillance, search and interview footage taken by the investigating units, Police Strike Force is a compelling insight into dramatic law enforcement takedowns.",
