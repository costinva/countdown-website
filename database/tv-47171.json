  "overview": "WWII, Europe completely torn apart. Portugal, pacific country by the sea, keeps a dubious neutral position. As a strategic point, this country attracts both of the belligerent sides, making Lisbon become the perfect stage for spies. It is under this ambiance of intrigue and suspicion that our eight-part miniseries takes place. When in 1942 is emitted an announcement by the Allies stating that all gold with the Nazi emblem would be considered theft, Portugal that receives this gold as payment for its exportation, has to come up with new ways to let this gold into the country.",
