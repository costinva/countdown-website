  "overview": "Each hour tells the stories of various snakes: how they live, why we can't see them, what they do to feed and breed, and how they deal with living near humans. Glossy natural history footage showcases the beautiful snakes and their behaviour. To tell the human side, we feature snake catchers entering houses and properties before rescuing the snakes and releasing them to live out their days in the wild. Snakes featured: Mamba, Cobra and Viper.",
