When a raging\n storm coincides with high seas it unleashes a colossal tidal surge, \nwhich travels mercilessly down England's East Coast and into the Thames \nEstuary. Overwhelming the Barrier, torrents of water pour into the city.\n The lives of millions of Londoners are at stake. Top marine engineers \nand barrier experts Rob, his ex-wife Sam and his father Leonard \nMorrison, have only a few hours to save the city from total devastation.\n A real probability in a real location. It is not a question of if, but \nwhen London floods.",
