  "overview": "We've seen more than our fair share of sizzling cheeseburgers, monster pizza slices and intimidatingly thick and juicy steaks over the years. But of all the down-home and delicious chow-down joints Adam Richman visited from coast to coast, there are the proud and the few so finger-licking good, they're simply unforgettable. In each themed 30-minute episode of Amazing Eats, we're celebrating America's most delicious, biggest and best of the best. From the most massive of meals served at a single table, to the tallest standing sandwiches in history, we're embracing it all. Each episode takes on yet another subject of the people's choices of chow - the meatiest, the most fried, the spiciest and the sweetest.",
