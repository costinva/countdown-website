  "overview": "GameFace is a comedy series that follows Marcella as she spiritedly crashes her way through life, assisted by her dubious life-coach, best friends and ever-patient driving instructor. Bouncing back from a seismic break-up, clinging on to her dreams of becoming an actress, and - when she remembers her lessons - finally learning to drive, Marcella is on a mission to change her future for the better. Starring Roisin Conaty as Marcella and packed with wry and idiosyncratic observations, GameFace is a witty, tender and resonant comedy about navigating your thirties when you're under-prepared - but somehow always staying afloat.",
