  "overview": "A part-time high school in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Students with all sorts of circumstances attend the school. Yanagida Gakuto (21 years old) is a delinquent who can't escape a negative spiral. Koshikawa Angela (43 years old), whose mother is Filipino and father is Japanese, has almost given up on keeping up with her classes. Natori Kasumi (16 years old) has orthostatic intolerance and continues to attend school in the nurse's office. Nagamine Shozo (76 years old) was unable to attend high school as a young man and had no choice but to work.Fujitake Kanae, an enigmatic science teacher, is assigned to teach these students, who are all different in age and background. With Fujitake's guidance, they aim to present their results at an academic conference based on an experiment to recreate a \"crater on Mars\" in the classroom, but various difficulties stand in their way, including their own disabilities, family problems, and unbreakable relationships.",
