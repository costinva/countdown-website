  "overview": "Every year, 310 killings in France go unsolved, leaving the victims' crushed families in a state of endless grief. The French judicial system is implacable: there's no money to continue investigating cases that lead nowhere.Hunting down murderers to help bereaved families get justice is more than just a job, it's a duty for Thomas Bareski, a retired, hotshot police detective. A wandering, footloose, nature-loving soul who lives out of his van, Thomas Bareski isn't just a one-of-kind man, he's also an extraordinary police officer who's ready to upend his way of life to fulfill his mission.",
