  "overview": "Incredible Inventions looks at the evolution, manufacturing and everyday use of items that have some unusual origins. With thousands of years of innovations to play with, AHC premieres weekly back-to-back episodes featuring some of our childhood favorites such as the bicycle, and our everyday heroes we take for grantedâ€”the wrist watch. From the pocket-sized Swiss Army Knife to the Winglet of an aircraft, no invention is too big or too small to cover.",
