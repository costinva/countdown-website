  "overview": "Everyone has first love and this love doesn't always have a happy ending. Even to Bo-Ra comes this first love and an unbearable crisis as well. The guy she loves with all of her heart turns out to be the son of her mother's boyfriend. She didn't know the end of her love would come so soon. Neither did she express her love as much as she could. She never knew that if you lose that opportunity and that moment, love just melts away like ice cream.",
