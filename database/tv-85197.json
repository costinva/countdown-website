  "overview": "The indomitable Fatima roams the cities of Central Asia and Russia, committing one crime after another. She encounters prosecutor Petr Yerozhin, who does not yet know how closely this investigation will intertwine with his own fate. The year is 1986. Young captain Yerozhin, a ladies' man and promising detective, is offered to become an undercover KGB agent. He refuses, ready to work as a loader rather than \"snitch\" on his comrades. At the same time, in distant Samarkand, Yerozhin's friend, police captain Vakhid Ibragimov, is having trouble getting his family life together. The bizarre interweaving and continuation of these two events serves as the plot of the series. Ibragimov's \"daughter\", having gone through a long path of shame and humiliation, becomes an indomitable criminal. Vakhid, who has become a big man by this time, is destined to be the first to fall by her hand. Police abuse of power will turn an ordinary slacker Edik Kadkov into a sinister maniac killer. True love will come to Yerozhin at 45, but this will only complicate his investigation. The fast-paced action moves from Central Asia to the Russian hinterland, from regional centers to both Russian capitals, forcing us to admire the positive characters and eagerly await the outcome.",
