  "overview": "At the Repair Lot, people with a passion for their classic cars are given a helping hand to get them back on the road. When this talented and diverse crew fixes engines, interiors and bodywork, they aren't just giving a car a new lease on life, they're keeping the owners' dreams alive. Award-winning motoring journalist Charlie Vowden meets owners and assesses how to keep their drives alive. Together with old and new school mechanics Derek Drinkwater and Hannah Gordon, Freya Read the trimmer, and bodywork specialist Jerilee Quintana, the team are on a mission to put any classic car, in any condition, back on the road.",
