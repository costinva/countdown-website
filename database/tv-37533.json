  "overview": "For the first time Guy Fieri is heading back to some of his all-time favorite Diners, Drive-ins and Dives spots on Triple D Nation. On this all-new spin on DDD, Guy checks in on some of the most memorable joints he has previously visited to see how they have been doing, and to get a taste of some of the new and classic recipes they are dishing out. Whether they have opened new locations, expanded their old ones, or added to their menus, these restaurants are always pushing the boundaries of their culinary comfort zone.",
