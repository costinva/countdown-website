  "overview": "\"What a Country!\" revolves around a ''citizenship class'' with a neat little cross section of foreign students: imperious Robert the African; grumpy Laszlo the Hungarian; fiery Maria and Victor the Hispanics; sweet little Yung Hi the Asian; trusting Ali the Pakistani, and shrewd Nikolai the Russian. Overseeing this determined brood is a nice-guy teacher Taylor Brown and an at-wits'-end school principal Joan Courtney, who is not quite sure what to do with ''these wonderful people from God knows where.''",
