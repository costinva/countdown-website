  "overview": "Explore the story behind the Bushes -- America's most powerful political dynasty -- and how they put two US Presidents in the White House. Narrated by Academy Award-nominated actor Ed Harris, The Bush Years: Family, Duty, Power explores the Bush family's internal dynamics: the influential matriarchs, sibling ambitions, and unceasing competitive spirit which drove them to power. Through archival footage and interviews with historians, journalists, political figures, and Bush family members, the series reveals a story of triumph, tragedy, heroism, faith, and an evolving conservatism.",
