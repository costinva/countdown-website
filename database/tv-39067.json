  "overview": "In The Devil Next Door, Spindale, North Carolina looks like an average American town but what was once a quiet community is now the epicenter of a federal criminal investigation involving alleged fraud. Former members have reported, to the press, allegations of physical and mental child abuse, forced labor, intimidation and separation of children from their parents, but the Word of Faith Fellowship Church denies any wrongdoing. The Church began in 1979 and is led by 77-year-old Jane Whaley, with additional churches in Ghana and Brazil. While the Word of Faith Fellowship affirms to be a devout Christian church, former members tell a different story: one of violence and exploitation. This series will follow many former members as they work tirelessly to make the community and the government aware of the injustices going on behind closed doors. It's the mission of these former members to convince those still inside, including their own loved ones and children, to break away from the Church.",
