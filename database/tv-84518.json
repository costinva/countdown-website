  "overview": "Vampires, Pirates and Aliens - a madcap animation series featuring blood suckers, swashbucklers, and alien eye-wobblers. Visit nocturnal suburbia and sample Life with the Blods for a taste of everyday life among the undead. Sail the high seas on board The Mad Maggot for rollicking adventures with Captain Blunder and his incompetent crew. Hop from planet to planet with The Extraterrestrials as they search for a way home and a decent square meal, dodging the clutches of the evil Zoomaster as they go!",
