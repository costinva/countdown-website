  "overview": "Happy Town follows the problem-solving adventures of an adorable hedgehog and ladybird best friend duo, Pep and Tabitha, in a charming and unique community. The brightness of the light in Happy Town depends on the townsfolks glee, so each time it starts to fizz out, the duo set out on a mission to make the sign shine bright again by helping others and encouraging everyone to help each other too.Â ",
