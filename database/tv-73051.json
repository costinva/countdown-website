  "overview": "Farm Crime is a true crime documentary series exploring the largely unseen dark side of Canada's agriculture industry. Each episode examines a case that wouldn't typically make the front page. Instead of kidnappings, cold cases and serial killers, the series examines the fascinating, lesser-known incidents that unfold in the margins â€“ the fields, farms and unassuming small towns that dot the Canadian countryside. Rare sheep gone missing. Potatoes sabotaged with sewing needles. A multi-million-dollar pigeon breeding Ponzi scheme. These are farm crimes, and they exact a real toll on rural victims who don't always get their due. Farm Crime approaches these stories with respectful curiosity, focusing on the people at the centre of the incidents, seeking answers, closure and justice.",
