  "overview": "Raphael has everything to please. He is charming, handsome, intelligent ... and he knows how to make the dead talk like nobody. The most talented forensic pathologist of his generation, he fascinates as much as he exasperates. Irreverent and teasing, he crunches life without losing a crumb, often in defiance of norms and conventions. A major challenge for Police Commander Hélène Bach, a busy mother and recently arrived at La Criminelle, who will have to collaborate with this extraordinary personality. Together, they will face the most complex murders by dragging us into the meanders of the realm of death.",
