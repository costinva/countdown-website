  "overview": "Inspired by true events, Y llegaron de noche is a workplace comedy series about the underdogs who accidentally made the best Dracula movie you've never seen—the Spanish version of the 1931 classic. While Bela Lugosi filmed by day, a separate cast and crew arrived at night to shoot the same movie in Spanish, using the same sets, costumes, and a translated script. Working from dusk till dawn, they defied the odds and created a superior version to the original.  ",
