  "overview": "Fenix is a young angel, who lives happily, oblivious to reality until Terra Sapiens, the capital of the terrestrial sphere, was invaded. It is then that it is revealed that he is heir to the powers of Androco, the legendary hero who sealed the king of demons. When the monks who were taking care of him die at the hands of the demons, Fenix swears revenge, and discovers the danger that the king of demons will be resurrected. To do this, you must find eight fragments of an old lithograph that will prevent this from happening. The young angel will embark on an adventure together with some young people who decide to join his fight: Asuka, Boro and Visnu (the latter, possessor of divine powers). Fenix since then will be forced to face endless demons.",
