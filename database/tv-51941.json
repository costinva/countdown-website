  "overview": "Sweets just got more fun, because we're taking competition to a whole new level with our brand-new series Candy Land that's inspired by the classic Hasbro children's game. Through six episodes, Emmy and Tony Award-winning actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth hosts and guides five teams made up of professional cake and sugar artists through the fantastical world of Candy Land. They're challenged to create heavenly confectionery showpieces, all the while being thrown curveballs every step of the way by Lord Licorice that puts their skills to the ultimate test.",
