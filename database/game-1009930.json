  "overview": "Neyyah is a first-person point-and-click adventure game, set within a collection of remote almost abandoned islands, separated by a series of complex portal machinery and laced with the fingerprints of two very intriguing cultures. Upon waking up from a strange dream, you find yourself transported to a place called Olujay, where you meet Vamir, who sends you to Neyyah in the hope you will be safe there. For reasons you will discover upon your many explorations, Vamir needs you for a matter of great urgency.  A wrong must be righted. A civilization avenged. A secret revealed. You end up on Neyyah with only a small amount of knowledge given to you by the frantic Vamir on what you’re supposed to do when you’re there. Things don't go as planned. In order to return to Olujay and reach Vamir, you will have to explore Neyyah – linking together the mechanical contraptions, rusted levers and blue plasma portal systems scattered throughout the bizarre landscapes, as you learn about the cultures that have shaped Neyyah.  Not everything is as it seems, and as you wander further into Neyyah's ancient heart, your discoveries will lead you to uncover the very truths behind the fate of Earth itself ...  Features Beautiful pre-rendered graphics, delivered with a high level of richness and realism. An original atmospheric soundtrack.Captivating sound design to bring you further into the world around you. An easy to use 2D style point and click interface, delivered with various cursor options so you'll always know what you are interacting with. Four movement transition settings: OFF / SPEED / NEUTRAL / RELAX, suited for each individual's style of gameplay. A 'Faster Travel' mode, where you can skip ahead of certain scenes to be able to travel quicker through the world, enabling you to get to where you need to be more effectively. Observe, take notes, think Neyyah reflects similar situations depicted within our own society, such as what is real, what is false, and being able to question your own beliefs. Through environmental storytelling, the player will enjoy hours of non-linear gameplay, solving puzzles through the use of close observation, visual links, writing down your own notes, using inventory items … while immersing yourself in a rich story and environment driven game. Let Neyyah become the world you were born to explore ...",
