  "overview": "Extra is a Modern Languages series aimed primarily at 14-16 year olds, but will also be of interest to older students who would like to improve their German.Extra is an innovative new idea from 4Learning: a familiar sitcom in a sophisticated setting which covers all the main programmes of study and grammatical areas needed for success at GCSE/SG. The scripts have been carefully written for the target audience and for those who find language learning difficult, the American protagonist, Sam, is there to come to their rescue. His efforts to get to grips with the language provide the central dynamic for the series' language learning content.Sascha and Anna share a flat in Berlin. They have a neighbour called Nic who fancies himself and Sascha. She doesn't return his affection but Anna does. Their landlady has very strict guidelines for the tenants and she regularly checks up on them.",
