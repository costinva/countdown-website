In Cape Town's slums where local gangs make the law, he is soon left with no choice but to work for one of them to support himself and his younger brother. Caught in a web of crime, he discovers he has an incredible talent for spinning, an exciting and extreme motorsport. Could this be his way out from the violent criminal life that seems to be the only option to survive in his neighbourhood?",
