  "overview": "Four children create their own happiness by remaining united. Abandoned by their mother, they move in with an aunt who undertakes, somewhat in spite of herself, to host the gang for a week, opening the door to a tidal wave of obstinacy, laughter and rapprochement. The week of accommodation turns into months, during which Nick, Loïc, Léa and Fred find the parental presence they never had.",
