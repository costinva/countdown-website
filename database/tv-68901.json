  "overview": "Laura is a woman who has the perfect family on paper – a loving husband and two beautiful children. But like any family there are cracks in their perfect veneer. Cracks that Emily, a charismatic stranger, is hell bent on exploiting.We see Laura led down an increasingly dangerous path as Emily nurtures Laura's neuroses about her ability as a mother, fuels tensions in her marriage and reignites an old flame from Laura's past. But Laura is hiding something too… and these two women are bound by a shared secret, one they have both tried to keep buried. But nothing stays a secret forever.",
