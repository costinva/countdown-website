  "overview": "The Barnes Bunch follows the well-known couple as they navigate blending their over-the-top families while making their way to the altar. Each hour-long episode follows this full-court family as they navigate fame, love and parenting alongside their wild inner circle of close family, friends and staff. Coming off their engagement last year, cameras follow Matt and Anansa's extensive planning of the engagement party and the wedding! Will the 'bad boy of basketball' finally settle down? And can this dynamic duo maintain their sanity while juggling six kids, busy careers and potentially another baby?",
