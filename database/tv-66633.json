  "overview": "This story began in 1860, when the Yenisei province was covered by a \"gold rush\" and miners from all over the country fled to develop gold mines. For ingots and precious sand lying right under your feet, a real war broke out between fugitive convicts, exiled officers, merchants and gendarmes.&lt;br /&gt;Echoes of the passions that raged in the vastness of the taiga, through the centuries, reached modern Krasnoyarsk, when the \"Russian Frenchwoman\" Barbara and the young historian Viktor Antonov arrived in the city. The official version of the visit - the preparation of a documentary film about Siberia - is far from reality. In fact, a young adventurer came to Siberia to see her small homeland with her own eyes and check the truth of one card she inherited. The search for a mysterious gold deposit leads to a new round of drama and a direct confrontation with crime.",
