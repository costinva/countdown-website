  "overview": "Forbidden Love follows four couples deeply in love who must come to terms with the one major hurdle complicating their relationships â€” religion. Hailing from different faiths, one partner from each couple is converting or has decided to relinquish their family-of-origin and culture entirely. Facing such intense traditional differences, can their relationships endure the trials of converting or will their love falter under the pressure? A compelling exploration of the ties that bind.",
