  "overview": "Lida and Masha Soykin are sisters, but, as often happens, they are completely different in character. The feisty and independent Lida is married, raising her daughter Varya and owns a sewing business, while the modest Masha has no job, no family, only loans and a dissolute lover, Vadim.Blackmailing Masha by breaking up, Vadim draws her into crime - they kidnap Varya in the hope of a ransom from the rich Lida. The kidnapping of the child reveals a tangle of family secrets, which begins to unravel dramatically and unpredictably, revealing the unsightly truth. The sisters will have to go through a difficult path to save the girl, understand and accept each other.",
