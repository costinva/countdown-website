  "overview": "Here's Your Fridge is based on Taylor visiting some of the country's most popular figures in their homes, where together they take on the task of cooking a three-course meal using only the ingredients already in the fridge. Although the concept rests on the cooking arrangement, it is a program that is at least as much about Taylor as the viewers getting to know the celebrities in a new way.",
