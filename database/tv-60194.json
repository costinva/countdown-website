  "overview": "Anton Ageev is an operative with one of the highest detection rates in the city, which is why the management turns a blind eye to his sharp, quarrelsome nature and unusual manner of work. And only Kira Kirillova, who appeared in the department 5 years ago, was able to find out the truth about the closed Ageev. But one day there is a murder, which Ageev and Kira witness. Watching the video of the moment of the murder, Ageev realizes that Kira is related to the case and is hiding something.",
