  "overview": "The meticulousness and professionalism of investigator Ulyana Sokolova was not liked by everyone in the capital, and there were people who helped her move to the small, deeply provincial city of Andreevsk. After moving to a new place, the heroine learns that the circumstances of her predecessor's death are very murky, so she decides to look into this story, unaware of the interests of which forces she will affect. It turns out that even in a provincial town there are their own \"godfathers\", who quickly get caught up in the turbulent activity of the new detective. In addition, the personality of Alexander Admiralov's partner, a former classmate and former lover, adds difficulties to Ulyana. Old feelings are returning with the same force, so Sokolova has pain points, which some people are eager to put pressure on.",
