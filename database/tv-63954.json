  "overview": "The historical series tells about the life of the grandson of Genghis Khan - Kublai Khan. The plot spans several decades and tells about the events that led to the creation of the Yuan dynasty by the great Mongol. After the death of Genghis Khan, his sons Tului and Ogedei entered the struggle for power. Despite the fact that Ogedei becomes Khan, his wife Toregin does not leave anxiety, because she remembers how the Great Genghis Khan singled out among his grandchildren Khubilai, the son of Tului. And even after poisoning her husband's brother, Toregin tries to eliminate MÃ¶ngke and Khubilai, who are thirsty for revenge for their father, accusing them of organizing an uprising. But thanks to the keen mind of Khubilai and the wisdom of his mother Sorgegtani, the Tului clan was saved.",
