  "overview": "Nos étés revolves around a century (starting in the year 1900) in the lives of two families; the rich Desrochers-Mannings who own a summer home and the poor Belziles their closest neighbors. The rich and the poor's lives are intermingled in a realistic way. The saga spans across different generations inside the 20th century, more than one timeline is followed at the same instance. We may see one character as a child and in the next scene as an adult. The \"future\" scenes are intermixed wonderfully well with the \"past\" from the very beginning of the series. We see shadows of things to come in the past and shadows of the past in the future scenes. The eras merge together in a magical, brilliant way that helps us fully understand the story since the past in intimately linked to the future.",
