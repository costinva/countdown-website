  "overview": "Mary Turner Thomson had grown used to her husband's frequent and often sudden trips away to far-flung locations as well as the secretive nature of his work, which meant he was regularly unable to maintain contact with her. She convinced herself that these challenges were a necessary sacrifice when your spouse, William Allen Jordan, was a CIA agent working in counter terrorism in the early 2000s. Or so she thought, until a fateful phone call in April 2006 from someone saying she was \"The Other Mrs Jordan\" blew her world apart.",
