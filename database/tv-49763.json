  "overview": "Three teams are pitted against each other in a battle to find words.Â With each round the stakes become higher and the prize money escalates. Tactics are paramount - if a team cannot find a word there are opportunities for their opponents to swoop in and claim the word and the money. Only one pair makes it to the End Game, where they can double their prize pot - however, if words fail them, they could lose everything and leave empty handed.",
