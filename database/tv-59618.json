  "overview": "In 2018, Antwerp Zoo will be 175 years old. From 20 February, reporter and master storyteller Arnout Hauben seizes this opportunity to take viewers on a six-episode tour through the rich history of Antwerp ZOO. After his many trips for, among others, the programs Ten war and The heroes of Arnout, this time Arnout is going on an adventurous trip close to home. With humans and animals in the lead. A journey back in time too: from the founding of the Zoo to the modern zoo it has become today. The Antwerp Zoo has captured the imagination for generations. Its glorious past is part of our collective memory. Arnout Hauben's earliest memories also consist of images of colorful parrots, elephants eating monkey nuts and the imposing gorilla Gust. The Zoo breathes nostalgia and lives on memories, but it is much more than just history. It is a meeting place for humans and animals and it plays an important role in scientific research and nature conservation at home and abroad.",
