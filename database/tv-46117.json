  "overview": "Twisted Love takes you inside the most unbelievably shocking crimes ever committed in the name of love. This jaw-dropping new series investigates how something as pure and simple as love and intimacy can turn into a hate capable of destroying lives and tearing entire families apart. We love our parents, our children, and our partners. We love with conviction, and with passion. But sometimes we are blinded by the unexpected power of love to turn into something more twisted. When adoration becomes obsession, and \"I love you\" turns into \"if I can't have you, no one will,\" matters of the heart become incentive for murder.Â ",
