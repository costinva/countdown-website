  "overview": "Seven school friends -who thought that by the time they are 30 their life will be sorted- turn 30 to find that it's a grand hot mess instead. They live, love, laugh, make mistakes, get their hearts broken, grow up a little but through it all discover that the best of friendships are imperfect and life is a luminous shade of grey.",
