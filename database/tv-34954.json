  "overview": "The science of escape and the art of ingenuity gets put to the test as escapologist Jonathan Goodwin attempts to break out of bizarre and dangerous homemade contraptions in the series One Way Out. Tied to his kitchen table with a live scorpion trapped inside his mouth or locked inside a box on top of a shaking washing machine with his body covered in 200,000 agitated bees, Jonathan is always on the lookout for new and extreme ways to test the art and physics of escape and find that \"one way out.\" He is joined by his best friend and chief collaborator Mikey Nelson and master builder/engineer Terry Stroud.",
