  "overview": "Classically trained Ludo Lefebvre is a 5-star French chef who's writing his own restaurant rulebook. He and business partner/wife, Krissy, are hitting the road to reinvent American cuisine. From Texas barbeque to Baltimore crab cakes, each episode finds Ludo and Krissy setting up innovative pop-up restaurants at local eateries desperate for fresh ideas. Working together with their hosts, the creative duo try to fuse Ludo's high-end cooking with American classics and reignite a community's passion for food - inspiring them to live a little more outside their comfort food zone.",
