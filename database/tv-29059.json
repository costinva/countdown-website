  "overview": "In Flip or Flop Atlanta, Ken and Anita Corsini run a family business, flipping over 100 houses a year in the Atlanta metro area. Their goal is to rehab old southern homes and revitalize the neighborhoods. But when some of the houses are abandoned for years and trashed by squatters, it takes a lot more than elbow grease to make these homes inhabitable again. Watch as this enterprising couple races against the clock to buy, renovate and flip homes in just a matter of weeks.",
