  "overview": "Don't be fooled by its appearance as a nice soft purple teddy bear. Mininours is a reactionary who gives his opinion on everything, gets carried away over nothing and smokes firecrackers all day long. According to its creator, Moustafa Benaïbout, this teddy bear aspires to a \"chill\" life. His dream: \"to live in a secluded place with a mountain of marijuana to smoke all day, play video games and watch movies\". Unfortunately for him, an ideal far from being achieved. Today on parole for having sold \"carambars\" at the end of a high school, Mininours is forced to work in the general interest. His sentence: supervising a kindergarten class. ",
