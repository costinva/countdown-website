  "overview": "Dr. Martin Helling, a vascular surgeon from Berlin, hangs up his job because of a phobia of blood, so he moves to the East Frisian village of Neuharlingersiel for a new beginning. However, everything is very different from his city life; there is no hassle in the practice, patients prefer to stay for a cup of tea. The comedy of the series is mostly centred on the peculiarities of the villagers.",
