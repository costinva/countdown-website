  "overview": "Building on the success of Is Australia Racist? this new series will uncover what Australia really thinks about disability, ageism and obesity. We'll commission the largest survey of its kind to reveal where the majority really stand and show a true picture of our national psyche â€“ then we'll see how that opinion can be tested, hardened and challenged using a series of ground-breaking hidden camera experiments.",
