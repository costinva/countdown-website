  "overview": "In 1998, 10-year-old Natascha Kampusch was abducted by Wolfgang PÅ™iklopil in broad daylight in Vienna and held hostage for 3,096 days. Much of her captivity was spent in a secret basement measuring five square meters, where she was both starved and abused. In 2006, Kampusch managed to escape and tell her story to the world - only to be met by mistrust and condemnation.",
