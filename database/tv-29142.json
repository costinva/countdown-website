  "overview": "Dreading an entire summer of LA public transit, a popular girl (Claudia Sulewski) with a suspended license and a boy next door (Steffan Argus) without a car, strike up an agreement at the bus stop: he will drive her car to get the two of them to work every day for the summer. But what starts as a business agreement between two very different people, slowly starts to become much more.",
