  "overview": "When Henry was just five years old, he discovered that eating his mother's mushy carrots gave him the extraordinary ability to make his wishes come true. Carrots became Henry's \"genie in a bottle\", and he was able to do things that most of us only dream about. Three years older, Henry is now eight and his mother's mushy carrots are still having an effect on him. His unusual wishes are often played out with unexpected consequences and his insatiable curiosity invariably spells disaster. While hilarity and high-jinks reign supreme, Henry also learns some of life's lessons along the way. But while Henry has been given the key to unlock universal mysteries, his road to enlightenment is liberally peppered with the incredible and outlandish escapades that only an eight-year-old could dream up.",
