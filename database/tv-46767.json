  "overview": "A culinary retreat that is anything but, through four one-hour episodes the six campers must brave the outdoor elements for a once in a lifetime opportunity to perfect their baking skills under the watchful eye of Camp Director Martha Stewart, along with camp counselors and baking experts Carla Hall and Dan Langan. Together with host Jesse Palmer, Martha leads the bakers through challenges each episode that test their skills over two rounds, with the most impressive baker of the first heat getting a personal one-on-one mentoring session with their idol, Martha, in her home kitchen. Equal parts baking boot-camp and camp-inspired games and challenges, the baker that displays the least amount of progress at the end of each episode will pack their bags and head home, with the last camper standing winning a kitchen filled with appliances worth $25,000. Welcome to Bakeaway Camp!",
