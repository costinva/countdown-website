  "overview": "A classic Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers fare. The evil members of Shadow Force, led by Emperor Dark, were trying to take over the cosmos, and it was up to Starcom to stop them. Young hero Col. James \"Dash\" Derringer, an ace Starcom pilot, was the star of the series, and several of his teammates were family members. He was also backed up by the resourceful ace pilot John \"Slim\" Griffin, whose niece was yet another Starcom pilot. Other heroes on the Starcom side included Col. Paul \"Crowbar\" Corbin and Admiral Franklin Brinkley. The show had very high quality production, with top notch animation and relatively mature subject matter and dialog. Together, the members of Starcom fought Dark's legions of robotic minions, flying into battle in a fleet of advanced spacecraft.",
