  "overview": "On the day the apocalypse was supposed to happen, Tomás wakes up hungover in the middle of an orgy in a furniture store. Months earlier, he had left his wife Julia and daughter Noa with the news that the world was ending, without looking back. But when the wandering planet that was going to crash the world passes Earth and life goes on, Tomás realizes the extent of his mistake. Now he will try to regain his former life and the forgiveness of his family, trying to rebuild a world that has not ended, but will never be the same. Meanwhile, Julia, who has always taken things slowly, sees this as a second chance and takes a leap to do all the things she didn't dare to do before. Noa, on the other hand, wonders why the adults insist on destroying the world all by themselves, without the need of a giant planet crashing into the Earth.",
