  "overview": "Psychic Academy follows the life of Ai Shiomi, a boy with psychic power, also known as \"aura power\" in fictional modern day Japan. This ability has emerged in the world, but not all people have it. Aura power itself allows certain elements such as fire, water, light, and earth to be used by those who have the ability and which type of power they can use depends on their aura and what they are taught.",
