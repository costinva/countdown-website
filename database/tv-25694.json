  "overview": "The residents of Robson Arms are always in some sort of drama. This Vancouver-based apartment building holds some pretty interesting characters behind its doors, who stir up the romance as well as the rent. Some are just out to party, others to work and move ahead, and some like the idea of seducing tenants.",
