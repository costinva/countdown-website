A total of 60 episodes have been confirmed so far. La Candidata was well received by critics, with its divergence in tone from previous telenovelas and the addressing of topics, such as political corruption, being particularly praised. It won eight awards at the 35th TVyNovelas Awards, including Best Telenovela of the Year.Like many women, Regina struggles every day for the welfare of her family, having to cope from the worn relationship with her husband to the rebellion of her teenage son ... but in her case everything is in sight, because she is the wife of Head of Government of the city and, as if that were not enough, an honorable senator, who always tries to do what is best for her fellow men. In the world of politics, a world where men build power at any cost, is Regina, who strives to improve the reality of people and impose ideals over power.",
