  "overview": "They came from somewhere else is one of the truly groundbreaking alternative comedy shows from the early 80s, when alternative comedy was something new. The series concerns surreal goings on in a small town with a secret. We are treated to killer prawns in the sewers, raining liver, tinned crabs cutting themselves out of tins, all kinds of really weird stuff.",
