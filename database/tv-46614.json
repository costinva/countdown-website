  "overview": "With exclusive behind the scenes access to staff from Network Rail - which operates the country's train tracks - their command centres and lines, The Station: Trouble on the Tracks focuses on Birmingham New Street Station, the heart of a transport network spanning from Aberdeen to Penzance.Cameras capture managers making critical decisions on whether to run or stop trains, and the so-called â€˜orange army', who are outside in high-viz clothes all weathers making sure the 20,000 miles of track are safe and serviceable.",
