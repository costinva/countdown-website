  "overview": "Former border guard Sasha Dymov returns to his native village of Kordonka after serving time in prison on a false charge. There is nothing left of his past life - his wife left him for her best friend, and it is impossible to return to law enforcement. His faithful comrade Trofimych comes to the rescue - he takes Dymov under his wing and gets him a job as a car mechanic in his workshop. It would seem that there is no more peaceful occupation. But there is a border nearby, secret smugglers' paths, big money, weapons and criminals dreaming of escaping persecution abroad... Only Sasha Dymov can stop this chaos. In addition to criminal showdowns, the hero will have to find a way out of a love triangle. And there will be mysticism in this story.",
