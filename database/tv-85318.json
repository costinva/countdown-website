  "overview": "Together TV proudly presents the premiere of four films exploring queer lives in Britain today. Brought to you by Together TV's BAFTA-winning Diverse Film Fund, this year's storytellers include the aquatic adventures of two queer mermaids, the tumultuous tale of a trans boxer campaigning for the right to fight, Britain's first out Muslim drag queen undergoing gender affirmation surgery and the struggles of two gay dads going through the painful child adoption process.How does somebody find their place in the world when they feel different to everyone around them? When don't they feel ‘normal' or that they don't ‘fit in'? These funny, raw, touching and honest voices from LGBTQ+ communities across the UK, explored with passion and heart from four exceptionally talented filmmakers, will take you on a journey of resilience and strength in the face of adversity as our protagonists seek to change hearts and minds in order to find acceptance within their communities.",
