  "overview": "Zhurov is an unlucky but very experienced detective. He travels everywhere in his old Pobeda, brings up his daughter alone, likes to drink and has a very vague amorous relationship with his colleague. All this does not prevent him from masterfully revealing the most complex and intricate cases, for which, apart from him, no one else dares to take on.",
