  "overview": "Senda Prohibida tells the story of a provincial girl Nora, who destroys a happy family to achieve the lifestyle and luxury she's always dreamed of. Set in a time when women were merely decorative objects, Nora Lopez – or Corina, as she is known in the underworld of cabaret –, is determined to achieve the wealth she always dreamed of, and nothing will stop her. From manipulating men with her pristine beauty to pitting a father against his own son, she is willing to destroy the love of a family and bring them to an abyss where any one of them will have to risk their own life.",
