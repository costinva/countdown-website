  "overview": "The story of a character is told who struggles with himself and the world and is allowed to shuffle the cards anew in each episode. But: what happens if the others suddenly behave as we would like them to? What happens to the \"I\" when the relationship to its environment is constantly changing, and new constellations with \"the others\" arise, which inevitably escalate?",
