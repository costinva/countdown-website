  "overview": "Thup, a young man with extraordinary senses, is drawn into investigating a mysterious murder case involving brutally mutilated bodies found in the forest alongside the more rational thinker Singha. But what they face goes beyond ordinary logic; it's not just the culprits they confront; it's the unforeseen dangers they encounter. As they delve deeper, they find themselves looking into murder cases spanning from the past to the present, ancient beliefs intertwined with unsolved mysteries, human greed inevitably leading to death, and the hopeless breakdown of trust affecting personal relationships. How will they cope when it becomes obvious that death could strike anyone, anytime... even those closest to them?",
