  "overview": "Mu-jin is a labor attorney who gets paid for covering up the corruption of problematic companies while visiting labor sites with high industrial accident risks. One day, during an inspection of a factory, he faces a near-death crisis when steel materials collapse. At that moment, a Bodhisattva with a burning labor law book in hand appears before Mu-jin and forces him to sign a labor contract. Then, Mu-jin gains the ability to see ghosts, and to save his own life he also must solve various labor problems brought by the ghosts and resolve their grudges.",
