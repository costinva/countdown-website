  "overview": "A brand new animated comedy for six to 11-year-olds, Dorg Van Dango follows the adventures of Dorg, a normal kid, living in the very normal town of Normill. That is, until he meets The Magicals: Jet Lazor, the super-cool unicorn; Patronella, an ancient witch; RD, a curious alien; and Yooki, an eerie ghost. They are all escapees from Area 52 and in desperate need of help and refuge. To have them blend in with the citizens of Normill, Dorg disguises them as teenagers and hides them in the basement in the local shopping mall. With his new best friends attempting to help navigate life's challenges, Dorg's world just got a whole lot less normal and a lot more fun.",
