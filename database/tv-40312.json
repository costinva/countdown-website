  "overview": "After meeting on the singles table at a wedding, five humans down on their luck in both love and life jokingly arrive at a solution to their real estate angst as solo flyers: they could pitch in and buy a house together. A really big house beyond the reach of any of their married friends. Is it a joke? Obviously. Are they drunk? Definitely. Will this stop them? Probably not. But, surely you can't co-invest, much less cohabit with a bunch of strangers you barely even know... or can you?",
