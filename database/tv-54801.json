  "overview": "Thirteen-year-old Jaz is sent to a town full of crazy kids and psycho adults, Wakkaville - as different from Sydney as night from day. But this is her last chance to get it together. With Flick, her self-appointed tour guide, Martin, her cowboy â€˜jackaroo' neighbour and Buzza, an aquaphobic surfer, Jaz makes it her mission to drag Wakkaville into the 21st century.",
