The party is torn apart by a conflict between party leader Reiulf Steen and Prime Minister Odvar Nordli. The alcohol flows, so do the leaks. At the same time, the socially engaged doctor Gro Harlem Brundtland becomes entangled in the political power game. She gradually becomes a masterful player and outmaneuvers her opponents. In 1981 she becomes Norway's first female prime minister.",
