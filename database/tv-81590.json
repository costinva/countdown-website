  "overview": "An Update on Our Family explores the complex and symbiotic world of family vlogging â€“ a phenomenon in which parents post a steady stream of lifestyle videos on their social media channels to be consumed by loyal subscribers whose views in turn generate money for the vloggers themselves. After controversy around former family vloggers Myka and James Stauffer went public, new scrutiny arose around the industry. The documentary raises questions about what motivates vloggers to expose their lives to the world and examines the issues surrounding making their children's lives public. The three-part series exposes the hidden-in-plain-sight, unregulated family vlogging industry.",
