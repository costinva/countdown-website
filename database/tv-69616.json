  "overview": "Mikhail Aleksandrovich Nefedov, a genius mathematician, teaches probability theory and mathematical statistics at the university. He remembers everything he has ever heard, seen or read. Mikhail learns that his teenage son has a dangerous genetic disease, the treatment of which will require a multimillion-dollar sum. Having sold the apartment, Nefedov makes a perfectly calculated bet on a local football league match, but ... loses. He couldn't have made a mistake, which means there is an unaccounted variable in the equation. And this is an underground betting business, where the results of games are rigged to extract illegal income. Mikhail calculates the organizers of the shadow business and demands his winnings from them. So begins the war of a university teacher with the betting mafia. Devoid of emotions, attachments and fear, a genius will not save himself from anything… But one day he will find himself a man — vulnerable, dependent and truly alive.",
