  "overview": "In Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives: Takeout Guy checks in with four past Triple D chefs from across the country via video-chat, to see how they are holding up, and how they have transformed their businesses to keep serving customers. Each chef has sent the full list of ingredients of their featured recipes straight to Guy's house and will guide him through each step to make the dish, just like when he is on the road and there in-person. But now, Guy will be virtually cooking along to prepare, plate, and taste each dynamite dish.",
