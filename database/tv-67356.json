  "overview": "Rise and Fall is a game about what it takes to get to the top - how to win power, how to keep hold of it and how to use it to influence others.Sixteen ordinary British people, from all walks of life and ages, will begin the game as equals but soon find themselves either in a position of power as a Ruler or as part of the powerless as a Grafter. While the Rulers live in an opulent penthouse, the Grafters must survive in basic conditions in the basement.Â Anyone can rise to a position of power and anyone can fall, but only one Ruler can win the prize fund at the end of the game.",
