  "overview": "In Atlanta, in the 1990's a complex web of personal stories unfolds. Paige, a promising Spelman sophomore, veers off her path to success when she falls for a \"bad boy\" just before the pivotal \"Freaknik\" event. Adulthood disrupts their lives, pulling Paige, her long-term boyfriend Malcolm, and newcomer Romeo into a series of challenges. Amidst Atlanta's global Olympic spotlight, eventual mayor Robert Dawn's rise to power comes at the price of personal sacrifices and moral dilemmas. These interconnected stories set off a transformative chain reaction in the city, echoing Dante's words: \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"",
