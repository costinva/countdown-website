  "overview": "When multi-millionaire Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in 2019, he had spent decades sexually abusing underage girls, using a deep network of powerful enablers to help cover up his crimes. Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich exposes a horrifying story of relentless manipulation and sex trafficking. Epstein's survivors serve as the series' pre-eminent voices, providing powerful testimonials about their experiences, and inspiration in their strength and resilience. Director Lisa Bryant examines the failures in the justice system that allowed the serial sex abuser to evade justice for so long.",
