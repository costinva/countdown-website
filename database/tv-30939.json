  "overview": "The 17-year-old singer, who made headlines in January when she agreed to sing the National Anthem at President Donald Trump's inauguration, will lead Growing Up Evancho, an hour-long program following her life at home. All of Jackie's family will be featured on the show, including mom Lisa, 50, dad Mike, 47, and siblings Rachel, 13, Zach, 15, and Juliet, 19. Juliet has become a star of her own, publicly coming out as a transgender woman in an exclusive October 2015 PEOPLE interview. She and Jackie have been outspoken about transgender rights since, and last fall, Juliet even filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against her Pennsylvania high school after she and her trans peers were barred from using the bathrooms of their choice.",
