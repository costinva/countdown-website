  "overview": "She is spicy, saucy, and gutsy. She will get you every time! Lukkaew is petite in size but big on character and can be feisty. Her nickname is Little Miss Sassy (Gaenkaew!) She is an advocate for sustainable farming. She has been pushing several farmers to move towards a farming system that is more sustainable â€“ environmentally, economically, and socially. It is not an easy task, and she has an uphill battle to tackle because she is young and the farmers don't quite understand the system. To make matters worse, she comes across Saran, the new Forest Chief who always goes by the book, and refuses to go by her rules. She has to deal with the farmers and Saran, who is her no. 1 enemy. The battle of wit and sauciness is about to begin!",
