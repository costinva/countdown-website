  "overview": "The loader Nikolay in the construction shop drops heavy boxes on the client Natalia. After the incident, the girl has a small bump, but her mother Tamara Igorevna still wants to sue the store. After all, on this day, Nikolai managed to annoy both her and her husband, retired General Sergei Gennadievich. Now the guy faces not only the loss of his job, but also temporary housing — a small closet in a warehouse. There is only one way to fix everything — to negotiate with the victim's mother. Then the poor guy has a \"brilliant plan\" of salvation: to hit on Natalia.",
