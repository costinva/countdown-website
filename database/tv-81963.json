  "overview": "For nine years, the Norwegian Crown Prince Harald and commoner Sonja Haraldsen fight for their right to marry, but the decision lies with King Olav. The Norwegian constitution bars Harald from marrying without royal consent, risking the monarchy's collapse. Defying tradition, the couple stands against the royal court, government, and pressâ€”all for love.",
