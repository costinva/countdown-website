  "overview": "Exciting animals live not only in the wild, but also at home, which are enormously important for most children as they grow up: their pets. A pet lives behind every third front door in Germany. Over 31 million dogs, cats, mice and birds are friends, partners, comforters, playmates or cuddly toys. Not every animal is suitable for cuddling and playing. Anna und die Haustiere wants to make you want to live with the animal, but also to develop a sense of responsibility.Â ",
