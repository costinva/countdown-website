  "overview": "Editor Xiao Qiu had just finished evaluating a cringe-worthy Mary Sue novel and firmly rejected it during the approval meeting. However, after taking a quick nap in her wardrobe, she wakes up in another world. To her shock, she realizes she has transmigrated into the very novel she had dismissed and has become the unluckiest supporting character, Shen Qingge! Although she has the author's \"golden cheat\" ability to see everyone's luck value, her own luck is disastrously low, attracting all kinds of misfortune. The novel's system informs her that only by staying close to the \"lucky charm\" male lead, Gu Yichen, can her luck value increaseâ€”and only then will she have a chance to return home.",
