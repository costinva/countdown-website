  "overview": "Predator at Large takes you deep inside peaceful communities in which a sadistic predator is living undetected, lying in wait, scoping out potential victims, and holding out for the perfect moment to strike. Once they act on their depraved impulses, lives are destroyed, as are the communities which these killers themselves call home. Brought to life by the extraordinary testimony of friends and family of the victims, local residents, and law enforcement, as well as those closest to the perpetrators, these terrifying stories reveal the true horror of what happens when nightmares come true.",
