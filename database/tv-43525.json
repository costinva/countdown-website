  "overview": "Billy Connolly's Great American Trail is a series that sees Billy going far off the beaten track into the places you've heard of but have rarely seen, as he follows the migratory trail of the Scots through America.Â Starting in New York and finishing in the heart of America, Nashville, Tennessee. This is a series bursting at the seams with music, football, gangsters, whales, real life moonshiners and not one but two, mad, bad and terrible presidents who both had Scottish parents! And they're all tied up together in this incredible story of the land of the free, as seen through the eyes of our nation's favourite comedian.",
