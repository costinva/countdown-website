  "overview": "A ghost that is suffering because of her love and duty. Her duty is to protect the nation's treasures ever since the end of the Ayutthaya kingdom. Centuries of vendetta and vengeance. Centuries of wondering as to why her lover had done such a terrible thing to her. She never knew why. The only way for her spirit to move on, to not having to look after the treasures for eternity, is for her to find a \"replacement.\" Ubol or in the current time, Sarochinee, does not wish for anyone else but him, Akkanee, the man that she loved more than her life. Love is love. A pure love expects the same in return. But when what she had in return is torment, she tries to find justice that she sees fit.",
