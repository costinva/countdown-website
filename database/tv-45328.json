  "overview": "In Slavik - Auf Staats Nacken, a Slavik boy becomes a testimonial for the employment office. For his steep career on YouTube and Instagram was his fate, as he has continued referring to Hartz IV and faces the charge of social fraud. To escape an ad, he produces promotional videos for the job center as a jobtester. In every episode of the Joyn format, Slavik is testing a new job on behalf of the employment office. Among other things, he tries to be a janitor in a strip club, a beauty salon and the Berlin police.",
