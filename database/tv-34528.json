  "overview": "Ten-part series Mega Machines unlocks the secrets of iconic machines, such as roller coasters, bullet trains, and cargo planes. Transforming our understanding of the machines around us, the series goes inside, under, over, and through them, revealing how they were built, how they work, how they fail, and how they have evolved. Episodes will look at the Griffon 12000TD hovercraft that skims effortlessly across water, concrete and even rocks at over 50mph, making it the ultimate all-terrain passenger vehicle; the Airfish 8, a unique breed of passenger vehicle, which is longer and heavier than a bus and can skim over water at 120 miles per hour; the Sikorsky built S-92 Helicopter, an evolution of the legendary Blackhawk military chopper; and Italy's Aprilia RSV4, the most advanced superbike in the world.",
