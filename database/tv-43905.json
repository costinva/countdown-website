  "overview": "Special consultant Roman Freydin is introduced to the crime detection department under the Prosecutor's Office. A psychologist and professional poker player in his younger days, Roman traveled extensively throughout Russia and Europe dealing with many people from different professions - from qualified psychoanalysts to magicians and fortune-tellers, from celebrated scientists to illegal gamblers.When investigating a crime, Freydin uses scientific methods but is ultimately guided by his intuition. He pieces together events from the crime scene creating psychological and physical profiles of the perpetrators so that he is able to preempt their next move leading to their capture. While the foundation of Roman's approach is psychological science, his method – Freud's method – is about directly provoking his suspects in order to catch them out. Unfortunately, he also employs this method in dealing with his new colleagues, which is met with a variety of negative responses.Nevertheless, his fellow officers acknowledge Roman as a brilliant expert and perhaps because of his odd and eccentric methods, Freud is able to solve some of the most complex cases using his outstanding insight and brilliant logic",
