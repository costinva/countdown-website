  "overview": "Will Mellor and Ralf Little pull back the curtain on a bickering bromance that stretches over 20 years, finding out how they can do life better as two middle aged men in their forties.Each themed episode sees the pair embark on a series of encounters and challenges that will test their attitudes on everything from embracing their 'spiritual' side, facing their fear of aging and discovering the perils of living off grid with no toilet paper.Viewers will be privy to all the action alongside the fly-on-the-wall intimate conversations that only two best mates could have.Whether they're being open hearted and honest, ridiculously competitive, or just winding each other up, Will and Ralf Should Know Better will let the nation bear witness to two friends getting life right but more often getting it oh so very wrong.",
