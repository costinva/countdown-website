  "overview": "Vienna public prosecutor Kara Hoffmann (Anna Rot) is killed in a car bomb attack, while her friend, the then chief inspector in Vienna, Alexander Haller (Philipp Hochmair), goes blind. Haller blames himself for Karas dead. When he tries to kill himself in Vienna at night, the daring Berlin taxi driver Nikolai Falk (Andreas Guenther) saves him. The well-heeled Haller hired him as a chauffeur and assistant when Haller's arch-rival broke out of prison and informed him that the attack was not aimed at him, but his girlfriend. Together, the two become private detectives and begin to re-examine Kara's last case themselves. Haller's particularly well-developed hearing and his sense of smell are of great help in this and other cases.",
