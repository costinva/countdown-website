  "overview": "Lyu Shao and Li Dun were once lovers, but fate had other plans—one became a consort, and the other a prince. Unable to attain Lyu Shao's love, Li Dun grew resentful, especially since her brother, Lyu Xun, was his romantic rival. After ascending the throne, his love for Lyu Shao twisted into cruelty. Determined to escape Li Dun's grasp, Lyu Shao devised a plan to flee. However, on her way, she encountered Consort Wenzhao. During their confrontation, a bolt of lightning struck them, and when they awoke, they had swapped bodies. As Li Dun began to notice unusual changes in Wenzhao's behavior, the real Wenzhao, now inhabiting Lyu Shao's body, realized she had unexpectedly risen to the position of Empress Dowager. Ambitious and power-hungry, she used Lyu Xun's love for his sister and her newfound authority to repeatedly try to eliminate Lyu Shao. Yet each time, Lyu Shao fought back. When Li Dun finally uncovered the truth about the body swap, Lyu Shao pleaded for her freedom. But unwilling to let her go, Li Dun imprisoned her once more—committing an irreversible mistake in the process.",
