  "overview": "As State Pathologist, Dr Marie Cassidy's name became inextricably linked with murder and tragedy. During her time in Ireland, Dr Cassidy's cases included the violent deaths of many women who she now wants to remember, not simply as victims or statistics but as real lives. With the cooperation of families and the help of peers and experts, she tries to understand why women continue to be abused and killed, mostly by men they know. What has changed since Dr Cassidy arrived in Ireland in 1997 and are women safer today?",
