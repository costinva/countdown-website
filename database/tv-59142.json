It will also look at fitting home chargers, buying a second-hand EV and understanding the future of the UK's EV charging network. Fifth Gear hosts Jason Plato and Vicki Butler-Henderson will be joined by Rory Reid, ex-Top Gear presenter, and former Formula 1 and Formula E driver Karun Chandhok. They will be assisted by EV consumer journalist Grace Webb and engineering ace Jimmy de Ville.",
