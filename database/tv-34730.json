  "overview": "\"The Invisible Man\" (Russian: Человек-невидимка, romanized: Chelovek-nevidimka) is a show in which experts use their superpowers, look into the future, talk about the past, and reveal the secrets and vices of the program's star guest, who is watching what is happening from a secret room. They have only a few personal items of the guest at their disposal and very little time to find out who is behind the scenes.The six experts are a criminologist, a palm reader, a psychologist, a magician, a shaman and a fortune teller. Until the last minute they know nothing about the guest, do not see or hear him, and cannot communicate with each other. The mediator between them is the presenter of the program, Evelina Bledans. Only with her does the \"invisible man\" share his impressions. At the end of the show, the experts must choose a photo of a person sitting in a secret room and say his name.",
