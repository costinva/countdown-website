  "overview": "«Supermama» is a psychological reality show in which mothers with radically different views on raising children compete for the title of the best. Each week, a new quartet of moms with different parenting principles and views on life will fight for victory. The heroines will visit each other, and therefore they will give marks to rivals in three categories: raising children, mastery and self-realization. At the end of the week, Dmytro Karpachov, the host of the program, will give his assessment to one of the mothers. The heroine who will collect the most points will receive the title of «Supermama».",
