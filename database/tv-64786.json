  "overview": "A young teenager, Tyar starts to experience supernatural apparitions. Initially treating the strange events as a means to develop their online 'ghost hunting' persona, Mr. Midnight, the group find themselves in increasingly perilous situations. At the same time, Tyar begins to unravel a family secret that may just lead to the key that will not only save them, but their home as well. As the situation escalates, Tyar's four friends, Ling, Nat, Zoe and Ben also face their own personal demons. As Tyar's visions become more real, his friends are drawn into a cat and mouse game with a malevolent spirit.",
