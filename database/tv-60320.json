  "overview": "Charlotte Burg has always had the necessary flair and flair for using her contacts in the very highest social circles. This fact also serves her well in her self-founded detective agency. Together with her detective Peter Lombardi and the former GSG 9 man and amateur boxer Georg Gentz, who joined the agency a little later, she solves even the trickiest cases. They are a really well-rehearsed team, they are \"Die Drei\" (\"The Three\").",
