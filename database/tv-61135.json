  "overview": "Although he is one of the littlest campers at the Forest Camp for Young Birds, Odo knows he can do anything he sets his mind to. Forest Camp is a wonderful leafy playground where birds of all shapes and sizes can play games, learn skills, and have fun side-by-side with the most amazingly diverse group of feathered creatures â€“ silly chickens, cheeky toucans, harmonious canaries, a vain peacock, and many others. And all the fun takes place under the loving watchful eye of Camp Leader, a supremely capable and good-natured Eagle.With the help of his best friend Doodle (a thoughtful little bird of unknown species) Odo positively tackles every challenge no matter how big. When asked if he thinks he can do something, Odo will always confidently reply, 'I know I can!'Because in the forest, as in life, the most important thing you can do is to believe in yourself.The series teaches young children self-efficacy and to believe in themselves to help combat the troubling rise in anxiety and depression levels in today's children. Comedic and warm, with a genuine gender-neutral hero, the stories also deal with important themes such as immigration, racism and respect for others.",
