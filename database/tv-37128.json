  "overview": "Set in a New York City no one knew existed, The Changeling focuses on the death-defying odyssey of Apollo Kagwa and Emma Valentine as they look to find out what happened to the son who was removed from them. On their voyage, they will travel through enchanted isles and haunted woodlands, meet glowing witches, demon giants and racist cops. They'll deal with the perils of personal technology and social media, toxic masculinity, the mental health of new mothers and fathers and find out if surviving a fairytale is as brutal as simply surviving in Trumplandia.",
