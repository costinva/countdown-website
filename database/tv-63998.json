  "overview": "The day after Christmas, Főmenü, Duna Televízíó's brand new gastronomy program, starts. Starting December 26, every Saturday from 5 p.m., Michelin-starred chef Tamás Széll and actor and director Zsolt Anger will prepare recipes for the viewers that are even better, and can be prepared at home. The two hosts will serve their guests mostly Hungarian dishes with a hint of rethinking. Of course, you can't miss such classics as blood sausage, stuffed cabbage or bacon lung, of course not in the usual form.",
