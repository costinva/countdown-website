  "overview": "The Discovery Channel is coming out with a home-made series. With the brand new Made in Gyetván Csabával, grouped around each topic, such as staples, renewable energy, robotics, it shows in an hour how everything that surrounds us is made. The \"How It's Made\" shows are popular both in Hungary and abroad, so Discovery is confident about the success of the new Hungarian show. Csaba Gyetván has been creating content on similar topics for a long time. Viewers can look through their eyes at places that are not usually visited most often and can also get to know the people who make these objects or products.",
