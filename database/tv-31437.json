  "overview": "Car fanatic Nate Boyer will build and customize anything that moves. As the owner of Kultured Customs, a thriving hot rod and car resto-mod shop, Nate is always looking for the next big project to reap huge profits. Now, he is taking his biggest gamble yet and opening \"The Doghouse\" – a community garage that's open to hobbyists and auto mechanics (aka ‘Dogs') looking to test their build skills. Nate rigorously vets promising candidates that will use his space, equipment, and brains in exchange for a cut of their final flip. The Doghouse opens its doors to Discovery Channel in the all-new series, Gear Dogs.",
