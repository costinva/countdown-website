  "overview": "Favorite artists of the past, stories of their destinies - in the new program of Boris Korchevnikov \"Distant loved ones\"!They were idolized, adored, postcards with their images and clippings from the magazine \"Soviet Screen\" were collected. They were considered celestials. But behind the scenes, famous artists were just people - with their passions, sorrows and joys. Today we literally collect the stories of their lives bit by bit: how they actually lived, whom they loved, what they suffered from, what they dreamed about. The presenter Boris Korchevnikov will provide the audience with unique testimonies: the memories of those who were next to the idols. Their relatives, friends and colleagues will discover what the stars of the past were like. So far away and so close.",
