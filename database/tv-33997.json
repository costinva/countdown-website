  "overview": "Hosted by TV grandmaster Paul McDermott, Think Tank is an exciting new nightly quiz show. Each episode sees three contestants go head to head, pitting their general knowledge and their general luck against each other , drawing on the wisdom of eight relatively ordinary Australians with an extra – ordinary love of trivia and general knowledge .But be warned…Our Think Tankers – like Australia itself – are made up of a diverse group of people plucked from all walks of life. They are there to help but sometimes they get it wrong.",
