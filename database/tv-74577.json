  "overview": "Pei Qian is an ordinary worker, but an unintentional bound to the wealth conversion system gives him an opportunity to do business and live a different life. However, the rule is that he can get only one yuan for making a profit of 100, but keep all the funding for losing money. In order to lose money, Pei Qian chooses the high-risk and money-burning game industry, and deliberately designs some offbeat games that violate the law of the market. Unexpectedly, all his games are popular, earning him a lot of money. Sadly, Pei Qian has become an enviable talented businessman, but only he knows himself that he really wants to lose money.",
