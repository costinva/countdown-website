  "overview": "In horror movies, nothing good ever happens to those in a Cabin in the Woods. In this series, true stories of ghastly, sometimes convoluted crimes take place in remote cabins around the country and for good reason: they allow those with evil intentions to carry out the most heinous of acts in peace and quiet away from prying eyes and ears. Combining hard-hitting investigative elements with spine-tingling thrills and chills, this true-crime-meets-true-horror series features the most terrifying crimes ever committed in isolated and otherwise picturesque cabin dwellings.",
