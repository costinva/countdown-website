  "overview": "From underground food markets to street corners to over-the-top private events, were on a food adventure with Fidel Gastro and his army of fanatical followers! With Matt Basile a.k.a. Fidel Gastro as our guide, were set to experience the world of pop-up food wherever it takes us.This Rebel Without a Kitchen is riding the wave of the hot new street food movement, in one of North Americas premiere food destinations Toronto, and is introducing us to an exciting kind of food experience. From his rusty, temperamental food truck Pricilla, or off collapsible card tables, Matt brings his infectious energy and marketing savvy to every uber-cool nook and cranny of the city as the unofficial poster boy of the street food movement.Through twitter and facebook, the masses are alerted to the next FG experience, and there the DJ of Cuban sandwiches himself, Fidel Gastro entertains, feeds and engages his ever-growing fan base, as we lick our chops and capture it all. From self-hosted events in the middle of a museum to overnight bush parties, Rebel Without a Kitchen is completely imbedded with Matt, his friends and his family on this frenetic adventure. We watch as Matt learns just what it takes to keep the sandwiches hot, stay one step ahead of city hall, keep the love of his life by his side, and stay grounded - on this entrepreneurial dream opportunity.",
