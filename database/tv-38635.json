  "overview": "Prodigal Son centers on Malcolm Bright who has a gift. He knows how killers think, how their minds work. Why? Back in the ‘90s, his father was one of the worst–a notorious serial killer called \"The Surgeon.\" That's why Bright is the best criminal psychologist around; murder is the family business. Bright uses his twisted genius to help the NYPD solve crimes and stop killers, all while dealing with a manipulative mother, annoyingly normal sister, a homicidal father still looking to bond with his prodigal son, and his own constantly evolving neuroses.",
