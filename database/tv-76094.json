  "overview": "Hunting Mr Nice: The Cannabis Kingpin tells the story of Howard Marks, who grew up in a Welsh village, dabbled in dealing weed while at Oxford university, before building a worldwide drug-smuggling empire and even working for MI6, at the height of the America's War on Drugs. For decades, the audacious and charismatic ‘Mr Nice' managed to evade prosecution before his luck finally ran out, serving time in high security US prisons before ultimately writing a bestselling book and campaigning for the decriminalisation of marijuana. This new insight tells the definitive story of the world's most notorious cannabis smuggler – and the police who devoted their lives to bringing him to justice, along with members of his criminal inner circle breaking their silence for the very first time. Also featuring journalists, lawyers and Marks' friends, the series takes us inside the cultural phenomenon of ‘Mr Nice' to ask how he was able to become so criminally famous yet continue to evade justice.",
