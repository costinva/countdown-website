  "overview": "A lawyer is selected to be in charge of a retrial for a case surrounding the abduction and murder of a girl in Kagawa Prefecture 21 years prior. At around the same time, another kidnapping case arises in which a young girl is also abducted with no charges being filled, making Chisa one of the victims. With this, she sets foot in her hometown of Kagawa for the first time in 10 years and, with the help of her colleague, reinvestigates the incident that had occurred at the time, where there is a high possibility that the perpetrator was responsible for the same incident, having Chisa confront the suspect who may have once tried to kill her in order to uncover the truth behind the incident.",
