  "overview": "Crongton chronicles the lives and journeys of a group of young people living in a thriving, multicultural community in a fictional urban housing estate, as they navigate the complexities of social politics, peer pressure and identity while trying to forge a place for themselves within a world full of possibility and littered with danger. Shot through with irreverent humour and featuring animated fantasy sequences, it's a joyful, energetic ride through the trials and tribulations of growing up, a celebration of the kind of community you only find on an estate, and a look at how you come to terms with the darkness of the world around you when you're on the cusp of childhood and adulthood.",
