  "overview": "TKO: Total Knock Out is a new one-hour obstacle course competition series hosted by Kevin Hart. TKO: Total Knock Out features people from all walks of life, where one player races through daunting obstacles while four other contestants are manning battle stations along the course, firing over-the-top projectiles in an attempt to knock them off and slow them down. It's a physical and funny \"us versus them\" scenario, with the fastest finisher winning a cash prize.",
