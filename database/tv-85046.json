  "overview": "\"What Then?\" is an interactive series about tactics in the male-female relationship. In the series with Deniz Işın and Sarp Bozkurt in leading roles, two characters who could not find the love they have been searching for yet, just give up and begin to consult different tactic books. We will watch funny and emotional moments of Sarp and Deniz, who ruin their date because of the tactics they read in the book, as they try to know each other. In fact, not only will we watch it, but we will also watch and see how the story goes on with different endings by deciding on the progress of the story thanks to the options we come across.",
