  "overview": "Golden Goal is an informal sports show featuring Johan Golden and Henrik Elvestad. The program was created both for those who love sports and for those who think they hate it. In each episode, they invited a guest in sports, and towards the end of the program, they always had an informal selection of fun things that have happened in different sports arenas.The show was mostly about football, but also covers other sports. A regular feature of the series was to reconstruct memorable moments from the history of sports together with some of those who took part in the actual event; another was a feature where Elvestad - sometimes together with Golden - tries out more or less curious sports.",
