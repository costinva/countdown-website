  "overview": "Drug dealer, gangster, gym-junky, Lamborghini driver, husband, father, dickhead. Australian Gangster is a four hour TV series about the life and death of a new breed of Sydney criminal. The kind that doesn't care about playing it safe or keeping a low profile or even getting caught. Our main character is emblematic of the type of modern gangster that only really cares about looking good on Instagram, making a name for himself in a new, wannabe glamorous crime scene, while at the same time trying to manage the pressures of family life.",
