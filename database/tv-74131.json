  "overview": "Modern dating is a complex process. The decision to choose a partner is influenced not only by our style of dress or profession, but also by how we present ourselves online. Enhanced profiles, filtered photos and bras that emphasize breasts are the norm on dating sites. What if we abandon the products of civilization and go back to our roots? It is an unusual dating show in which the participants choose a candidate for a date based on their... naked bodies. Is a kind of television experiment that attempts to answer the question of whether choosing a partner solely on the basis of physical features determines the success of a relationship.",
