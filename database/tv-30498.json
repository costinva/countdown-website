  "overview": "Top Gear America will review not just exclusive and state-of-the-art vehicles, but also the cars of America's culture-defining past. From the latest supercars to the ultimate in automotive engineering technology, Top Gear America will put the viewer in the passenger seat alongside the car-obsessed hosts, as they race the most incredible vehicles on the scenic highways and historic tracks of the American west. Each week will feature a different celebrity who will compete for top honor on the leader board at the new Top Gear studio and track, Speed Vegas. Of course, the one and only Stig, Top Gear's mysterious test driver, will be leaving everyone in his petrol-hazed wake.",
