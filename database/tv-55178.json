  "overview": "In Meet the Meerkats audiences will meet a cast of distinct characters and personalities and be submerged into the incredible world of meerkats while following the journey of three rehabilitated mobs, most of whom were snatched from the wild as pups and returned to their rightful home in Africa after being rescued from the illegal wildlife trade. Witness their stories of resilience and evolution as their lives ebb and flow in their new environment bringing the inevitable mix of joy, wonder and jeopardy that make these gregarious animals so irresistible.",
