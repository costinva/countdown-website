  "overview": "In police chase, Channel 5 is with the police on the hunt for drivers who are clearly under the influence of alcohol or drugs or are simply driving too fast and recklessly. There are many horror drivers in Denmark, and the police do what they can to stop them before they can put other people's lives at risk. The program follows a number of traffic officers from police circles around Denmark in their daily work with traffic offenders.",
