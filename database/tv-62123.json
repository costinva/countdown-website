  "overview": "Hold the Front Page follows the highs and lows of Nish and Josh as they travel across the UK working for a different local newspaper each week, on a mission to find real local stories strong enough to make the front page. Their investigative journey around Britain sees them delve into local mysteries, take part in unusual events, cover the burning issues of the day and even involve themselves in the news or enlist a celebrity or two to help them out along the way.But with almost no journalistic experience the pair have to rely on their quick wits and natural curiosity as they attempt to get to the heart of makes each town or village tick - digging up some extraordinary scoops. This is an eye-opening look at some of Britain's amazing local communities through the lens of their local newspaper. What could possibly go wrong?",
