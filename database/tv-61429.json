  "overview": "Xu Wuzhou opened his eyes to find himself transmigrated into the body of a notoriously delinquent son-in-law. The guy spent his wedding night in a bridesmaid's bed, and wandered into a brothel in search of a meal. Now his beautiful wife has lost all faith in him, and his father-in-law exiled him to the training grounds in disgust. And all Xu Wuzhou got for this trouble was an ancient artifact starving for blood?Â ",
