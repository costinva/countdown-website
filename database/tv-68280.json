  "overview": "A group of brave youth who are not afraid of bullets, guns, and hardships. The students stay firm in their beliefs to save their country. From the years 1937 to 1946, Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Nankai University temporarily merged during a historic moment in Kunming to form the National Southwestern Associated University (Lianda). As the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, young scholars and intellectuals rose up to fight a battle through literacy.  ",
