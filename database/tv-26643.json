  "overview": "Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, Summer Camp Island follows two best friends Oscar, and Hedgehog, and Oscar who are dropped off at a surreal summer camp. The camp is a host to many odd occurrences such as: camp counselors who are composed of popular girls who know magic, horses that transform into unicorns, talking sharks, post-it notes that lead to other dimensions and nosy monsters that live under the bed. Oscar and Hedgehog must contend with these out of place events and make their stay at camp worthwhile.",
