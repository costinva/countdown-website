  "overview": "Riko Komukai is an average type of person who has an average personality, appearance, favorite things, sense and values. She works for an event planning company, and Riko, who belongs to her third division of the event, which is said to be the \"honest department\" in the company, said one day her colleague the word \"mass production type human being\". I ask myself. At that time, when I suddenly became interested in the model store I found in the town, I caught my eye on \"Zaku\" that appeared in the TV anime series \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" written as \"mass production type\" and recommended it to the owner of a straight-laced shop. To challenge to make the first plastic model as it is. Her Riko is gradually attracted to the charm of the plastic model, which is an opportunity to reconsider herself.",
