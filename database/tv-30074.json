  "overview": "VH1 has once again teamed up with Ego Trip for a brand new series that follows on the heels of the hugely successful Ego Trip's The (White) Rapper Show series. Ego Trip's Miss Rap Supreme puts a distaff twist on the South Bronx-based series that challenged contestants' musical \"cred,\" knowledge of hip hop culture and their ideas about race.Ten female contestants from across the country will live in a house in Los Angeles where their quick-witted rhymes, stage presence and their mental toughness will be put to the test in this 8 episode series. Rap legend Michael \"MC Serch\" Berrin (of the group 3rd Bass) returns with a new partner, Grammy Award-nominated rapper Yo-Yo.",
