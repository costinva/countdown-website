  "overview": "Endurance's format is somewhat similar to the television series Survivor, though with a teenaged cast (however, there are more elements of the U.S. version of Big Brother). Endurance contestants live in a remote location and participate in various mental and physical challenges, Endurance contestants compete as pairs (one boy and one girl), and the outcome of the competitions determines which pair of players is eliminated.",
