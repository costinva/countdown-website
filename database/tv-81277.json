  "overview": "A night of ferocious clashes in Val di Susa. A team from the Mobile Unit of Rome loses their chief, who is seriously injured. Mazinga, Marta and Salvatore's team, however, is not like the others, it's a team from Rome, which had to learn to contrast chaos and troubles with extreme methods as well as with the harmony of a tribe, almost like a family. A family that the new commander, Michele, part of the reformist police, will have to deal with. For such police, teams like that are the symbol of an old school that must be refounded. As if the chaos that hits the new squad at the moment of maximum internal fragility wasn't enough, there's also a new wave of people's discontent with institutions.Among rising tensions, the team members are called to take sides and forced to question the deeper meaning of their work and their own membership of the Department.",
