  "overview": "Rob Bell presents an eight-part series on the defences that Britain put in place in 1940 to defend the country against the very real threat of a Nazi invasion. Over 6,000 structures were built, repurposed or requisitioned. This series looks at just some of the buildings that were designed to fight Hitler.",
