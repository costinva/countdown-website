  "overview": "Hiroshi Kataoka is a banker who knows things aren't right, but endures it anyway. \"It's for the good of the company,\" he tells himself. And Hiroshi is true and proper Japanese \"salaried man.\" But he's also a man of passion who can't help but be moved by the hard work of his subordinates and colleagues. So right before his 50th birthday, when he gets news that he will be promoted to manager of the Kamata branch that has been earmarked for eventual closure, he is conflicted. \"Don't kill yourself working for a branch that's closing,\" his bosses advise him. \"You'll get good treatment when you return to headquarters afterwards.\" But no one under Hiroshi has any knowledge that their jobs are doomed.",
