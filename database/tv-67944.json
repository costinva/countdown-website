  "overview": "A bruising four-part tale of crime, justice and mixed martial arts. \"Lightning\" Lee Murray brawled his way from the mean streets of south London all the way to the UFC â€“ and then nearly pulled off one of the largest bank robberies in history. Caught in the middle of a motley crew that made off with over $92 million dollars in a complex overnight robbery involving hostages, disguises and cross-border escapes, Murray took the fall when it all unraveled. Part ripping heist yarn, part riveting sports drama, this is one wild ride.",
