  "overview": "The six-part miniseries retells the largest blackmail case in Germany from different perspectives. In 1988 and from 1992 to 1994, Arno Funke committed bomb and arson attacks to extort department stores. In the latter case, a previously unknown media hype broke out around the hunt for the man behind the duck mask, who made history under the pseudonym \"Dagobert\". Arno Funke alias \"Dagobert\" is available as a consultant for the project.",
