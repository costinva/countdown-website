  "overview": "Nine-year-old British host Billy Jenkins, the youngest person to wear a CBS Sports blazer, is getting his own show King B's Hot Seat which will begin airing on Sunday, July 2, leading into the network's coverage of the Quicken Loans National, to be played at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm in Potomac, Maryland. Jenkins talks with PGA Tour players Jim Furyk, Boo Weekley, Brandt Snedeker and Wesley Bryan using his own unique style of interviewing. He will also chat with CBS Sports' golf analysts Nick Faldo and Gary McCord. Look out for \"golf cart karaoke\" with Faldo, Jenkins' version of Carpool Karaoke, and magic tricks with McCord. Tune in for these antics and much, much more.",
