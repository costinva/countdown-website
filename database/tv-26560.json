  "overview": "Hyper-lethal superweapons dominate today's battlefield. But how did they evolve? Explore weapon prototypes to cutting-edge super weapons and the fascinating stories behind the pedigree of the world's modern arsenal. Weaponology takes high-tech future weapons and unlocks their family tree, tracing the roots of each one's existence. Discover what links a 19th-century Scottish pastor to the assault rifle, a seed-planting device to the machine gun, and how a pizza delivery boy became the Henry Ford of body armor. If you like things that go BOOM, you will love Weaponology... It's time to go ballistic.",
