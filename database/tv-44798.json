  "overview": "Every day you read stories about prison sentences in the newspapers. How many years in prison does someone risk. How quickly someone can be released again. How a penitentiary leave sometimes goes completely wrong. And above all: who on earth's sake has decided that this particular prisoner was allowed to leave the four walls of the prison. You will find the answer to those questions in Ooit Vrij.",
