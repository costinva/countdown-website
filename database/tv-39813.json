  "overview": "In Mexico, a rare mix of wildlife fights to exist. From desert to grassland to sea - animals hunt, mate and migrate. With the Pacific Ocean cooling the west, the Caribbean warming the east, and rugged mountains stretching from north to south, Mexico is a diverse refuge. Each landscape boasts rare and unique behaviours evolved by animals going to extreme measures to survive and ensure the safe arrival of the next generation.",
