  "overview": "World's Most Amazing Videos is a reality television show similar to Real TV and Maximum Exposure. Like these shows, it showcases accidents, disasters, police chases and other extraordinary events that are caught on video camera, and few videos with deaths are shown. Although it is similar in content to Maximum Exposure, it takes a more serious tone. The show originated on NBC as a timeslot filler program. A new series of episodes of the show were created in 2006 first-run for SpikeTV, after a six year hiatus from the NBC stint.",
