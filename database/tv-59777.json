  "overview": "Hotel Portofino follows a British family who open a hotel for upper class travellers on the magical Italian Riviera during the ‘Roaring 20s'. The Hotel has only been open a few weeks, but the guests including the imperious Lady Latchmere, are demanding and hard-to-please. Bella Ainsworth the co-proprietor and moving spirit behind the hotel, quickly finds herself being targeted by a scheming and corrupt local politician, Signor Danioni, who threatens to drag her into the red-hot political cauldron of Mussolini's Italy",
