  "overview": "Gradins portrays supporters of different French clubs during a football match. If each episode goes well in a stadium, the camera here is never turned towards the lawn: the stories take place exclusively in the stands while the match is played off-screen. Mythical stadiums, shabby stands, presidential boxes and boiling bends are all opportunities to dwell on what really makes football: the people!",
