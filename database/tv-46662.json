  "overview": "Accomplished chef, Gemma, and her paramedic boyfriend, Kieran, live together in West London, above Gemma's café. Kieran and Gemma are madly in love. But unfortunately, love alone can't pay café suppliers, or London rent. The pair are barely making ends meet, and their different shift patterns mean they're like ships in the night. To ease some financial pressure, they've decided to take in a lodger. Enter Ray, a former world-class synchronised swimmer, whose arrival with a Volvo full of baggage commences a modern-day love story that will change the trio's lives - and how they view relationships - forever.",
