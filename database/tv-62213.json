  "overview": "Challenge Anneka will shine the light on everyday heroes and deserving communities at a time when they've never needed help more. Across the series the team will meet a wide range of inspirational people who will help Anneka move heaven and earth to achieve these challenges.  True to form we'll see Anneka pulling up at secret locations to meet the individuals at the heart of the challenge and be briefed on the task at hand.  With a mountain to climb, her trusty mobile, buggy, lorry and Dave the Soundman in tow - Anneka will be calling in big favours from big brands, big names and big groups of volunteers all keen to lend a hand. 30 years on from the original series the challenges of course will be new and reflect Britain in 2022, but at its heart the series will still be about incredible people who really want to make a difference to the world they live in.  ",
