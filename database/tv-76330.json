  "overview": "When hitmen are in love, they put both their lives and hearts at risk. Now only one question needs to be answered: is it to kiss… or to kill? Kant, a badass tattooist police informant, is asked to investigate a hitman brother duo. But when his attempt to dig up information by getting close to the younger brother, Bison, gets curbed by the overprotective big brother Fadel, Kant has no choice but to find someone to take Fadel out of the way. That's where Style, his good-looking foolhardy mechanic friend, comes in. Now the two friends are putting their lives, and hearts, on the line.",
