  "overview": "StuGo is an original animated series about six overambitious middle schoolers who are tricked into attending a fake academic summer camp by a mad scientist. Now they're stuck for three months on a wild tropical island with mind-reading manatees, giant fighting fungi and fashion-forward mutants â€” less academia than they'd hoped for, but a lot more adventure.",
