  "overview": "#Somebody's Son, a one-of-a-kind dating journey in the world of Black love, romance and family. The series is derived from the popular hashtag (#SomebodysSon) that celebrates the search for Black love, bringing the online sensation to life on screen. It follows three charming, single and successful men as they embark on a high stakes search for true love, looking for a lasting partner amongst a group of exceptional single women. But there's someone extra along for the ride -- each of their mothers will be joining them on this adventure, offering guidance, support and a little drama as they help (or attempt to help) their sons find the one. Through competitive challenges, bonding activities and heartfelt moments, the moms play a pivotal and sometimes divisive role in determining if mother truly knows best when it comes to matters of the heart.  ",
