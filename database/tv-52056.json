  "overview": "A new intern has been assigned to the police department in the small town of Mavki. It is an unpleasant surprise for the chief of the department, Oleg Kravchenko, that the intern is none other than Kira Zadorozhnaya, a young woman who clearly comes from a well-off family. Oleg and Kira's relations turned sour since the day they first met. Oleg dislikes Kira's glamourous and lavish lifestyle, her independent spirit and her annoying habit of breaking ranks. Kira, in turn, considers her boss to be a petty-minded, meticulous, boring and dull fish. However, events soon conspire to force them to change their minds about each other.",
