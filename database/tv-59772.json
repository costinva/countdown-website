  "overview": "The brutal woman murderer André Haffner is able to escape from the penal system in a spectacular way. The young investigator Sunny Becker takes up the chase and puts all her energy into arresting the fugitive. The Magdeburg police officer is supported by her colleagues Ralf Keller, Markus Fechner and Jakub Svoboda and her partner Alex Reuter, with whom she also lives. However, the tough chief detective does not trust her colleagues with everything. In addition, she has an ambivalent relationship with her therapist Nora Belling, who knows more about Sunny than she suspects. These shouldn't be the only problems for Sunny Becker, who, in the search for the murderer, has to confront the man who is determined to destroy her life. ",
