  "overview": "In this thought provoking series, BBC Three plots a course around the UK to meet those for whom sex, sexuality and having children is less than straightforward.From the couples searching online for their perfect sperm donor, to the transgender escorts grappling with their own identities and relationships, and the comings and goings of a busy sexual health clinic. Sex Map of Britain is an unflinching exploration of the highly personal stories about sex and sexuality that people across the country have to tell.",
