  "overview": "Pets &amp; Pickers is the story of animals, their owners, and the special team of veterinarians who care for them. Motivated by extraordinary compassion and a singular belief that all animals deserve treatment, this 8-episode, unscripted series reveals how the Regional Animal Protection Society (RAPS) Animal Hospital works tirelessly to offer low-income pet families access to top healthcare. To fund these treatments, RAPS has a unique solution: their thrift store. Serving an energetic, dedicated group of animal loving \"pickers\" who comb through donated mystery bins containing abandoned storage locker items, all money raised goes to pay for vet care and lifesaving critical surgeries. It's a one-of-a-kind \"pets and pickers\" relationship with an uplifting mission: to help animals and their people.",
