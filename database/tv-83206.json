  "overview": "Creepy Bits is a 10-episode chilling horror collection that delves deeper into the unknown, drawing inspiration from contemporary issues and venturing into uncharted territories of fear. Each episode is helmed by a diverse range of innovative filmmakers, including Ashlea Wessel, Adrian Bobb, Kelly Paoli, Sid Zanforlin, and  creator David J. Fernandes. The series explores themes of human vs. nature, the invasion and destruction of the natural world, and isolation within a vast, eerie landscape that fights back. From the depths of the forest to the darkness of the lake, to quaint small towns, each episode promises to unsettle and disturb. ",
