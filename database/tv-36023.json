  "overview": "Bedtime is a unique comedy series set in the bedrooms of various adjoining Ealing houses during the last half-hour of the day. Andrew and Alice Oldfield are the couple to whom - and around whom - so much is happening; a small suburban world of car alarms, noisy lovemaking, broken windows, newborn babies and revenge as a dish served fiery hot. From the couple whose marriage is tested in unexpected ways, to the young model who falls into the clutches of tabloid journalism; from the grieving son and his empathetic father to the lover with a demanding deadline; from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day - over three series you are invited through open doors and closed windows into the hilarious, surprising and completely engaging world of other people just before Bedtime.",
