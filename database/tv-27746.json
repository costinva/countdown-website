  "overview": "To kick off our brand new singing show, The Naked Choir, we want to hear YOU sing!Get a group of friends together, or go solo, and belt out the iconic kiwi track ‘Why Does Love Do This to Me' by The Exponents (you can sing just a small part of the song, the chorus or the whole thing - whatever you want!). The rules are simple: no instruments – just you and your Naked Voices.",
