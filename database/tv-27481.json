  "overview": "In Off the Beaten Track, Christine Bleakley goes in search of this side of our country that's hidden from view - a world you can only discover if you turn off our busy main roads and follow our enchanting byways, bridleways and winding country lanes.This is off-the-beaten-track Britain as you have never seen it before; a Britain that we may have thought was disappearing but is in fact thriving - brimming with secret histories, curious customs and lively traditions - where old-fashioned and modern ways mingle.And there's only one way to truly explore it: by getting involved. Across the six episodes Christine rolls her sleeves up and joins a ladies' tug of war team in the Peak District, is chased by bloodhounds in Essex, dodges whirlpools in Northern Ireland and that's before she's even uncovered ancient cave markings in Fife, whipped up some eye cream in Herefordshire, or gone swimming in the River Wye.",
