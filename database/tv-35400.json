  "overview": "In the center of the plot is a love triangle: a successful businessman Nikita, his wife Lera, and her young wife, Maya, who has not yet found her love. One day Maya heard a sonorous laughter on the playground and at that moment firmly decided: she would definitely become a mother! The search for a potential father for the unborn child turned out to be in vain and it seemed that Maya was about to give up her dream ... But at that very moment, fate itself brought it to Nikita, the acquaintance of which began with a major scandal, but this meeting changed her life. The path to happiness, of course, will not be easy: Maya has yet to overcome all the intrigues of Nikita's wife Lera and her mother.",
