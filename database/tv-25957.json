  "overview": "HaAh HaGadol VIP (Hebrew: האח הגדול VIP‎‎; lit. The Big Brother VIP) started on March 1, 2009 and ended on March 31, 2009. The VIP season was the second season of the Israeli version of the Big Brother series and the first season of the VIP series. The show follows the main Big Brother rules, but with some changes. For example, in VIP Big Brother the show's duration is shorter - a month (31 Days - like in most of the countries it is aired in). Thirteen celebrity housemates spent a period of five weeks together in the Big Brother House. Housemates include singers, models, a fashion designer, a journalist and other well-known Israeli personalities.The housemates were not told who the other people who were entering the house would be, but were aware of the predictions that were made in the media, particularly that of Guy Pines which accurately predicted the majority of the housemates.",
