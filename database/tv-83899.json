  "overview": "The everyday lives of homeless people Jeren, Alisa, Tatsu and Midu are colored by insecurity and drugs. They spend their days walking or snoring. Sometimes they go to prison and when they get an apartment, it's hard to hold on to it. Love brings hope and dreams include a normal everyday life, a family and a job. First, however, they would have to get into substitution treatment, and that's not exactly simple. What are the prerequisites for getting into a good life when you have a violent childhood, an institutional youth and drug-fueled circles of friends behind you?",
