  "overview": "A six-part anthology series about the megafires which devastated Australia and captured the world's attention, Fires is inspired by the extraordinary stories of the people who survived last summer's catastrophic fire season and continue to endure the aftermath even today. Each episode is based around character studies of ordinary people caught in the unimaginable and the impossible choices they were forced to make. From volunteer firefighters and families who lost homes, livelihoods and loved ones; to people who had to make agonising decisions about whether to stay or flee, and those who found themselves responsible for the lives of friends and strangers.",
