  "overview": "Fifteen years after witnessing her father's brutal murder, Kim escapes her controlling mum Tina and their isolated existence in the Scottish wilderness and heads south to England to find his killer…and just maybe find herself along the way.  But the modern world isn't what Kim imagined and when she meets hapless brothers, Nicky and Dave, a drunken prank goes spectacularly wrong.  Now hunted by murderous criminals working for gangster, Jimmy Davies, Kim must reunite with her overbearing Mum if they are all to survive.",
