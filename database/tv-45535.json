  "overview": "This series goes inside the walls of HMP Belmarsh with Ross Kemp to offer a sharp insight into the harsh realities of life behind bars at arguably the country's most notorious jail.With cameras gaining full access to the prison in South East London for the first time, Ross went inside the jail over a period of six months to find out what life is like inside the maximum security lock-up that has housed the country's most dangerous - and infamous - convicts.Cameras follow Ross as he explores how prisoners and staff cope with high-profile inmates, extremists and common criminals living side-by-side, goes inside the High Security Unit – the only ‘prison within a prison' in England and Wales - experiences the effect drugs can have on prisoners, and gets an insight into Belmarsh's efforts to rehabilitate inmates.He also sees how this complex prison operates as a violent protest unfolds outside, gaining a full-access close insight into life for staff and prisoners while it goes into lockdown.",
