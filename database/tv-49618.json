  "overview": "Host Nina Parker returns to the roundtable with celebs from across the NBC broadcast and cable entertainment networks for an open dialogue on the power of the black vote on both a local and national level, the vital role that local elections play in changing the system, the changes this new generation can make with their vote, and the effects that the pandemic could have on people going to the polls. From the doctors speaking on how to safely vote in person to an emotional conversation on Black people's voting experience and how it has affected them more than any other race in the country, this compelling special strives to educate, speak to the key issues, and ignite Americans to exercise their right to vote.",
