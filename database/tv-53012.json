  "overview": "We all think we know how the inside of our homes should look, but most of us have absolutely no idea what to do outside. Your Garden Made Perfect gives home-owners the opportunity to see their outside spaces transformed into breathtaking wonderlands, before they are created in real life.Using the latest visual technologies, radically different designs are showcased digitally, allowing people to see what their garden could look like before a wheelbarrow is filled or a tree uprooted. As well as big budgets and mega plots, there are also clever low-cost reinventions of small spaces too, packed with tips and tricks to inspire people at home to get stuck in themselves.",
