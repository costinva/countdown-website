  "overview": "After Germany's defeat in 1945, Hitler's most trusted henchmen tried to downplay their role in the Holocaust and distance themselves from the brutal Nazi regime. But they couldn't hide their misdeeds forever. Charting the lives and careers of the Führer's most prominent planners, designers, architects, and builders, Hitler's Engineers: Building the Third Reich exposes the truth—revealing the active role these men played in shaping the war, fueling anti-Semitism, and convincing everyday Germans to join their sinister cause.Featuring leading journalists, historians, and academics—and combining science, engineering, and history—the premium six-part series investigates Volkswagen Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche, infamous architect Albert Speer, aerospace pioneer Wernher von Braun, and more.",
