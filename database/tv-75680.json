  "overview": "In his latest epic adventure, Michael Palin embarks on a 1300-mile journey across Nigeria.Known as â€˜The Giant of Africa', within 50 years Nigeria will be the third most populated country in the world after India and China. And while claims of corruption and fraud have blighted the country he also finds a very different Nigeria - stunning nature, diverse cultures and fascinating people. From the chaotic energy of Lagos to Islamic history in Kano and the tropical landscapes of the south, yet in some areas the spectre of terrorism remains. For Michael, at 80 years old, it may well turn out to be the most prophetic journey of his life.",
