  "overview": "Petrolhead Planet is the ultimate automotive travel show. Not only is Jethro Bovingdon your guide to the greatest roads in the world, but he tells you how to find them, too! And if that's not enough, in every episode Jethro has a \"modern classic\" along for the adventure. We're not talking any old car, either, but the crème de la crème of iconic performance cars from the '80s, '90s, and '00s—think Porsche 911 GT3 RS 4.0, McLaren P1, that sort of thing. A mix of epic landscapes, in-depth car reviews, and useful how-to guides, Petrolhead Planet will have you packing your passport in no time.",
