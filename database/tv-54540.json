  "overview": "The casino is a meeting place of dreams, loves and luck, where anyone can turn: a widowed casino owner who has returned from America and wants to get rid of her husband's legacy at all costs, a step-son who is ready to help with the sale, he knows some underworld figures, a balanced boss who falls in love with the best stuntman in the country, a number mage countess whose nothing escapes his attention, and even a security guard, a taxi driver, a brother and sister, a journalist, a reporter, a lawyer, waitresses, employees, regulars; in a word, many determined players. Here everyone bets and the wheel never stops.",
