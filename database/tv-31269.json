  "overview": "Richard Rawlings and his team - including Russell J. Holmes, project manager, and Chris Stephens, garage designer - travel the country to find shops that need help. In each episode, Rawlings takes over a shop, making all decisions for the business as he works to revamp and revitalize the enterprise using his entrepreneurial savvy, deep knowledge of the auto industry and marketing skills to transform the struggling garages into profitable businesses. Holmes, a construction expert with more than 20 years of experience who saw his own father lose a family business, is tasked with getting Rawlings' rehabs done on time and on budget. Stephens, a shop owner specializing in restoring vintage European cars, is responsible for taking Rawlings' vision for the shop and implementing the design from the ground up.",
