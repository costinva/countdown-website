  "overview": "A documentary story of one of the brightest stars of the national pop scene. Her name alone is enough to fill both the county recreation center and the largest arena of the capital. Even if the name Zivert is unfamiliar to you, then you have heard the song Life for sure - a super hit that blew up the Russian and European charts. Just a talented girl, she suddenly became one of the most sought-after singers, looking at passers-by from billboards. Inside the series there is not only behind-the-scenes footage, but also an almost mystical story about how in one year you can turn from a flight attendant into a star whose songs attract tens of thousands of people at concerts.",
