We all know how it feels to fall in love, and then to lose it. And we all have questions about our past relationships and things we wish we'd asked at the time.But what if your Ex is the one that got away? The love of your life who you may never replace. Face to face once again, could you persuade them to give you another chance?With humour, tears and life-changing jeopardy, this is a hugely revealing relationship format that puts true love under the spotlight.",
