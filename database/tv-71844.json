  "overview": "Like most people, Pod Save America cohost Tommy Vietor thought foreign policy was boring and complicated until he got the education of a lifetime working for President Obama's National Security Council. It was a crash course that taught him two things: anyone can understand these issues, and we all have an obligation to try. That's why he started Pod Save the Worldâ€”a weekly podcast that breaks down international news and foreign policy developments, but doesn't feel like homework. Each week, he and former deputy national security advisor and co-host Ben Rhodes walk you through the latest developments with a variety of experts and take you behind the scenes of big decisions with the people who were there. Count on hearing stories from the White House Situation Room, funny anecdotes, and maybe a few F bombs along the way.",
