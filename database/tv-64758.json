  "overview": "Asphalt Cowboys - Ladies on Tour focuses on four women who are very familiar with large vehicles such as trucks, heavy transporters or trailers. Moni, Christina, Anne and Janet are on the road in Germany and Europe and make sure that the goods they are transporting find their way to the customers. It doesn't matter that they don't conform to the stereotype of a truck driver, because everyone is the same behind the wheel. The four ladies face their challenges with a mixture of ambition, zest for action and stamina - every day anew.",
