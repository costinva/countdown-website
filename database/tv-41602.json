  "overview": "31 a. of C. Manio Sempronio, a well-to-do patrician, unintentionally kills a senator and is condemned to death. Unable to end his own life, he asks to commute his sentence for anything, whatever. Thus he is sent as a legionary to Thrace, the land where his father, The Magnificent, forged his legend as a soldier.To the burden of recovering the family honor, we must add that his slave Agorastocles accompanies him: a friend, a brother ... Another burden. He has his own ambitions that, like every slave, can only live through his master.Thrace has been calm for decades. The camp is governed by the General of the Legion, an old man in the care of his daughter Valeria, a woman accustomed to the goings-on of Rome who takes her father wherever he wants.The arrival of Manio, desperate to be a hero, will turn upside down, in a record time, both the military stability of the area and the daily life of all those assigned there.",
