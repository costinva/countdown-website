  "overview": "In each episode of Massive Monster Mayhem, three real-life kid heroes are placed in a fictional alternate universe to compete in a gauntlet of intergalactic challenges in order to become Earth's champion. Contestants are eliminated through a series of three rounds, which culminate when the last player standing faces off against one of overlord Master Mayhem's monsters to save the planet. Each action-packed episode features two hosts who provide fun commentary during gameplay and non-stop hijinks from Master Mayhem and his monsters.",
