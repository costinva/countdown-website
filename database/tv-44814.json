  "overview": "In the heart of Mpumalanga, in the small town of Fransbrug, is the Fransen Hotel. The hotel, which once was the highlight of the small town, now barely has a one out of five on Trip Advisor. Hotel is an Afrikaans mockumentary about a middle aged hotel manager, Ferdie Kruger, and his small town staff, struggling to keep the doors of the hotel open. The hotel is taken over by the bigger hotel group, Lourier, and a young consultant, Thomas van As, is sent to improve the small hotel's standards, however Freddie and Thomas's management skill differ and the series follows their comic feud to put their personal mark on the hotel.",
