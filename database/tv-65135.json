  "overview": "Having had a taste of Antarctic adventure on Captain Scott's failed 1901 bid to reach the South Pole, seven years later Ernest Shackleton leads his own expedition. Agonisingly close to reaching the Pole, the men have to pull back in an appalling blizzard to reach their ship before the advancing ice cuts off the passage home. By 1911 Roald Amundsen has reached the Pole and Scott and his men, trailing in the Norwegian's wake, have perished. Undeterred, in 1914 Shackleton and his trusted deputy Frank Wild set out on their most famous journey aboard Endurance, with the aim of crossing the icy continent from sea to sea.",
