  "overview": "The Orange Blossom Classic is an American annual college football game first held between 1933 and 1978 and again since 2021. In its first incarnation, the Classic featured two historically black colleges and universities (HBCU)â€”Florida A&amp;M and another program. The game sometimes served as a de facto championship game, depending on the record of the participating teams. The game was played late in the season, with Florida A&amp;M inviting another top black team as its opponent.In its second incarnation, the Classic returned in 2021. That season, Florida A&amp;M played Jackson State in a season opening game at Hard Rock Stadium in September. The game has continued as an annual early-season contest between those two programs.",
