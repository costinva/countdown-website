  "overview": "Left at the door of an orphanage just a few days after birth, Isabel \"Chabelita\" has grown in a shady atmosphere and with lack of affection. Her short life has been even harder because of constant mistreatment she has received from the strict director of the institution. In spite of the difficult experiences that Chabelita has lived through, her spirit is up and she is very optimistic. She has an almost magic ability to unite people, and her enthusiasm is contagious. When she was told that her father lives in the Mexico City, Chabelita escapes from the orphanage to find him. This is the beginning of the adventures of this wonderful girl, who, while she looks for her family, brings love to all lonely and needed people whom she meets on her way.",
