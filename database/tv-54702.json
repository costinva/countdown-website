  "overview": "Cuts at SAS mean that Captain Odd Grenland and 2nd pilot Birger Wom are fired because they are too old. Grenland buys a used aircraft with his own money, and together they start the company Senior-Air, which will compete with SAS on the Oslo-Bergen route. With them they get the mechanical genius Joar \"Jojo\" Johansen, Jasmin Rosenrot, former cabin manager in Spantax and the number genius Karl Åge Tørkle. ",
