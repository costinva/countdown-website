  "overview": "German answer to \"American Crime Story\": The first season is titled \"Gefesselt\" and is inspired by one of Germany's most notorious serial killers, the so-called \"acid barrel killer\". Oliver Masucci embodies Raik Doormann, who terrifies the Hamburg area in the early 1980s and 1990s. He kidnaps, tortures and brutally kills women in his own nuclear bunker. Clues to his deeds are first found by the victim's guardian and later homicide detective Nela Langenbeck (Angelina HÃ¤ntsch). During this time, however, women within the police department are seen more as secretaries than investigators. Nela therefore initially earns headshakes for her approaches, but against all odds she eventually gets on the trail of Doormann and his gruesome deeds.",
