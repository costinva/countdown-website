  "overview": "On the 20th anniversary of National Geographic's Academy Award®-winning \"March of the Penguins,\" SECRETS OF THE PENGUINS changes everything we ever believed to be true. From the emperor penguins' revelatory bonds of friendship to the gritty resolve of gentoos and rockhoppers and the astonishing ingenuity of the migrant penguins that reached deserts and far beyond, their incredible traditions and societies echo ours in ways we never dreamt possible — until now. For over two years, BAFTA and Emmy® Award-winning wildlife cinematographer Bertie Gregory has collaborated with world-leading scientists, using cutting-edge camera technology and unique access to capture three world-first episodes that resonate with our lives like never before.",
