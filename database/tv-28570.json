  "overview": "Myf Warhurst's Nice takes viewers on a cultural crusade to explore some of Myf's favourite things from her youth in music, food, fashion, photography, art and design. It's a show that embraces cultural icons of the past and takes a closer look at what moulds us and leaves an impression to make us what we are today - the stuff you'd find in your own living room rather than in a gallery or museum. It's a celebration of all the things that are just, well...â€˜nice'. Over six themed episodes, Myf explores everything from the awkward family portrait to the humble dim sim, to questionable fashion choices and an unhealthy obsession with cheesy love duets.",
