  "overview": "Cash in the Attic will make a comeback to highlight collectible items relevant to today's audiences. Courtney Tezeno, a passionate collector, and her team of expert appraisers will sort through homes looking for classic toys, vintage comics, original video games and other valuable pop culture treasures to sell at auction. Homeowners will use the money to fund life-changing dreams, such as a down payment on a new house or a once-in-a-lifetime vacation.Â ",
