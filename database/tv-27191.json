  "overview": "Professor David Starkey chronicles the story of Queen Elizabeth I, first broadcast in 4-parts on Channel 4. The series uses a combination of tableaux, testimony from descendants, contemporary documents, actors and Starkey's own narration to tell the story of Elizabeth who reigned for over 40 tumultuous years. She was in constant danger from both ambitious men and the adherents of the Catholic religion. Starkey says that her deep distrust of men derives from two events: molestation by her stepfather Thomas Seymour, and an uprising by the Protestant Wyatt against Queen Mary, which landed the young princess in the Tower. The survival instinct she developed in her early years would become invaluable later when she succeeded to the throne. As Queen, Elizabeth had to prove that a woman was capable of ruling the warring factions in her court. The self styled Virgin founded a national church, and warded off the Spanish Armada.",
