  "overview": "Hana Tabata is used to being invisible. With a plain appearance and a pessimistic view of romance, she's convinced that love and cute things are out of her reach. But everything changes when Yousuke Ueno, the handsome and kind boy from her class, suddenly takes an interest in her. As Hana navigates awkward moments and unexpected attention, she begins to question her own worth and what it truly means to be seen. A heartfelt, offbeat high school romcom that proves love isn't just for the beautiful.",
