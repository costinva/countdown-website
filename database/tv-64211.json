  "overview": "Emma is a 30-year-old woman who is disappointed with her ten-year marriage to Nando and her family life, who feels that her life has lost its luster. Trapped in a routine without any romance or excitement, she realizes that if she could go back in time, she would not accept Nando's marriage proposal and decides she should divorce him. A couple of days later, while being on her way to see a rare lunar eclipse with her friends, a glitch in time sends her back 10 years earlier, to 2008. Her 30-year-old mind is trapped in her 20-year-old body. Life gives her a chance to reevaluate who she was and who she wants to become, with the distinct advantage of already knowing what the next decade holds for the world.",
