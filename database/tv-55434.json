  "overview": "When a severed/detached hand is mysteriously discovered in a salt marsh, Captain Franck Mercoeur and forensic anthropologist Marion Vinci investigate. Marion establishes the hand belonged to a woman who disappeared 90 years ago... The DNA tests identify the woman as the great-grandmother of a local psychiatrist who herself recently vanished in a car accident. But after a second hand is discovered and another woman vanishes, a terrifying pattern begins to emerge. The investigators discover that five women were murdered back in 1918 putting their descendants' lives now in grave danger... Can a killer from 1918 resurface?",
