  "overview": "Together with his alter ego The Pub Landlord and joined by comedians and personalities from each country he visits, Al will be attempting to unpick the Great British psyche in a bid to understand whether we are helped or hindered by our illustrious military past and how our regular harking back to Britain's glory days is viewed by our near neighbours and so-called â€˜allies'.In each episode Al will tackle Britain's relations with a different one-time military adversary, ranging from France and Germany to those who have occupied Britain at various points before being unceremoniously ejected, such as the Romans and Vikings, finishing with that fairest of all fair-weather friends, the Americans.",
