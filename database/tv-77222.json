  "overview": "Lyuba and Roma are tired of their marriage, but their pregnant daughter Nastya and son-in-law Styopa decide to help their parents save their family and give them a tour to a five-star hotel in Turkey. They agree so as not to upset their daughter, but they don't think about any restoration of the relationship. On the contrary, Lyuba quarrels with Roma on the plane, demands a divorce, at the very first dinner begins to flirt with a handsome Turkish man, drinks too much, and in the morning discovers a corpse in her bed.",
