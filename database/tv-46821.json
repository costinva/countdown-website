  "overview": "Cooked with Cannabis challenges chefs to use the title ingredient for more than its best-known quality. During each episode, three pro chefs work against the clock to create a three-course meal based around themes that range from world cuisine to futurist food to the kind of weed-heavy holiday menu that could make even your least favorite uncle seem tolerable.",
