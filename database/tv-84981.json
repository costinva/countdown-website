  "overview": "Nikolai Larionov, the author of one hit of the 2000s, dreams of regaining his former glory and does not suspect that, besides music, there is another pride in his life - his 14-year-old daughter Kosha. Everything changes when ex-wife Jeanne flies to Italy and asks to look after the teenager. Kosha is not happy about the appearance of her sloppy father and wants to get rid of him, while Nikolai is looking for a way to return triumphantly to show business. A common cause will help them in this — an online dating agency.",
