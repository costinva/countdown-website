  "overview": "Dave Mordal is a man who takes his job very seriously even when that job is playing Bigfoot paintball. He immerses himself in unique and often highly competitive situations, daring to take on the local experts, be it in swamp buggy racing or cowboy action shooting. He is unmatched in his commitment to shotgun bowling and pumpkin boat regattas. In Wreckreation Nation, Mordal seeks out ingenious, dangerous and dubious ways Americans find to kill time. In this all-new series, host Dave Mordal travels the nation in search of bizarre hometown traditions, unusual competitions and downright peculiar pastimes that make this country unique. Each episode highlights the adventurous attitudes and fanatical dedication of people across the country and the lengths they will go in order to have a little fun!",
