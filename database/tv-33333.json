  "overview": "Wrong Man is a groundbreaking documentary series which examines three different cases of inmates who have been incarcerated for decades and claim they are innocent. The series will uncover new theories, offer alternate suspects and reveal startling new evidence that could prove these inmates are not guilty. In Wrong Man, cameras follow a team of esteemed legal, investigative and forensic experts including renowned civil rights attorney Ronald Kuby, former prosecutor Sue-Ann Robinson, retired NCIS investigator Joe Kennedy, and Ira Todd, a member of Detroit's elite Homicide Task Force, as they re-investigate the cases of three inmates who have been locked up for decades and claim they are innocent.",
