  "overview": "Professor Rousseau is irreverent and rebellious. He shares his passion for philosophy with his students as he arms them in mind and spirit. Except, that is, for his own son. Theo may be his dad's favorite student, but he's no teacher's pet - If (as the saying goes) the shoemaker's son is often shoeless, will this teacher's son remain consciously clueless?",
