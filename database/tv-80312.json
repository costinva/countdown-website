  "overview": "Tell Me Along the Way is a talk show sprinkled with road movie elements, which not only takes viewers on a journey through the landscapes of Hungary but also promises plenty of excitement. András Sváby and his celebrity guest leave modern technology behind, hop into a camper van, and embark on a two-day trip, where adventures and friendly conversations take center stage. The host takes his companions to places that have played an important role in their lives, while also giving them tasks that push them out of their comfort zones. They spend the night in the camper or a tent, and András Sváby takes care of dinner. Beautiful landscapes, honest moments, challenges, campfires, cooking, a camper van, no gadgets — this is what Tell Me Along the Way has in store for viewers. The guests will include Róbert Alföldi, Péter Geszti, Mariann Falusi, Csaba \"Cyla\" Kajdi, László Lakatos, Réka Rubint, Győző Szabó, and Liliána Szilágyi.",
