  "overview": "Dr Christian: 12 Hours to Cure Your Street follows the nation's favourite doctor as he travels across the UK in a mobile clinic to treat individuals in their hometowns. Visiting a range of areas, Dr Christian will be racing against the clock as he attempts to do as many house calls and appointments as he can within a 12-hour shift.Each episode sees Dr Christian, accompanied by Dr Sara Kayat (GPs Behind Closed Doors, Celebrity Island), take on the challenge, unaware of what symptoms and conditions their patients will have until they open the front door. With GP's rarely being able to offer home visits to patients, this series will put even the most experienced doctors to the test as they bring professional healthcare to the UK's doorstep.",
