  "overview": "Spain begins to flourish again after the 'great war' and tries to imitate the rest of Europe by becoming 'fashionable'. That was the intention of Alfonso to set up the party room, The Continental. To get it going, he asked some lenders for help, trusting that the success of the store would pay off the debt. But everything played against him and the local failed to take off. The story of The Continental starts at that precise moment when Alfonso is not able to face the debt, with great consequences for his life and that of his daughter Andrea.",
