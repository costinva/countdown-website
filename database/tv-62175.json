  "overview": "Rosie Molloy is addicted to everything. Smoking, alcohol, Terry's Chocolate Oranges, Xanax, Adderall, caffeine… the list goes on. After an embarrassing incident at her brother Joey's wedding, she wakes up in hospital and decides to change her life by ‘giving up everything'.But as Rosie juggles her father's ill health and the possibility of losing her job, she has the dawning realisation that her addictions are destroying everything - her friendships, her family and her work life. Harder still is the realisation that perhaps it isn't the addictions that are the problem. If Rosie really does give up everything, will she still be Rosie?",
