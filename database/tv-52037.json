  "overview": "Dave is the symbol of a spoiled generation - not doing anything but wanting to achieve everything. A lovable klutz who is never really down due to his excessive self-esteem and with luck he will achieve a lot in the end. As a spoiled son of rich parents, he hasn't really had to deal with real life yet. That's how he got his \"15 Minutes of Fame\" when he was allowed to work as a reporter for ORF, but finally failed. Now he wants to start out as an influencer or get Money and Fame in some other way. In this unstructured search the anti-hero Dave is accompanied by the young filmmaker Jan Nikolaus and his camera, who could win him over to shoot a documentary about his life. Jan sees here his chance to produce a significant work of contemporary history and portrays Dave's everyday life. Â ",
