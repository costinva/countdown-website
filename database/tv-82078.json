  "overview": "When winter slams into the highways of the American Rockies, heavy recovery specialists from four companies race into action, working to clear wrecks and open roads. Whether it's a raging fire or toxic spill, crews roll up ready to battle the wreckage. They've got the equipment and the skills. But with more than a million people depending on the route that crosses these three states every day, the one thing they don't have, is time.",
