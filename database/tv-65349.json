  "overview": "Double Savage is the intense story of two brothers fighting for love and fury. The three siblings, Li, Pakorn, and Pawin were born into a Thai-Chinese household and have grown up to be very close. Their father, Go Beng, hasn't always been affectionate towards Pakorn, who was born right in the middle of an economic crisis and thus regarded as \"bad luck\" for the family. In contrast, Pawin, who was born when the economy was expanding, is the golden child and their father's pride and joy. The two brothers' relationship comes to a halt when two people arrive: one is Rungtawan, the daughter of a nearby sewing factory's owner, and the second is Ahsalha (Ah), a criminal Pakorn accidentally gets involved with that turns him into a suspect in a big criminal offense. The bond between two brothers turns into deep wounds in both of their hearts. The outlaw Pakorn has to go up against the police officer Pawin; now they are enemies as well as love rivals. How will this battle between the two brothers play out?",
