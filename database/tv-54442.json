  "overview": "On a cold night in January 2004, gunshots rang out across the remote Swedish village, Knutby, home to a small, tight-knit Pentecostal congregation, leaving a young woman murdered in her bed and her neighbor suffering from multiple bullet wounds. Attention soon turned towards the community – the victim's husband, also the sect's pastor, the victim's 26-year-old nanny, and the sect's leader known as \"The Bride of Christ.\"   Tracing the chilling events of January 10, 2004, and the resulting police investigation, criminal trial, and its aftermath, Knutby: I blind tro highlights Berg and Johnson's meticulous re-examination of the case. Their investigation includes in-depth interviews with journalists and police investigators who covered the crimes, as well as former members of the Pentecostal sect, some of whom are speaking for the first time about the psychological and physical abuse they suffered. Knutby: I blind tro revisits one of the most bizarre and confounding crimes in modern Swedish history, exploring new case theories, never-before-seen materials and exclusive interviews, ultimately shedding new light on the truth behind the crime.",
