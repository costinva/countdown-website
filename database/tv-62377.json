After two years of working frantically, Irina Rimes feels the need for a change in order to find herself again. With the support of the music label she's signed to, Global Records, Irina goes on the road for two weeks, traveling in a mobile studio through six cities, in order to complete her album Home. Bucharest, Brasov, Piatra Neamt, Iasi, Chisinau, and Izvoare as the final destination.
