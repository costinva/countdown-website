  "overview": "Dinah! is a daytime variety talk show that was hosted by singer and actress Dinah Shore. The show was the successor to Shore's previous variety effort, Dinah's Place, which aired from 1970 until 1974 on NBC and was cancelled to make way for a network edition of the then-syndicated game show Name That Tune. The series was distributed by 20th Century Fox Television and premiered on September 9, 1974 in syndication. In 1979 the show became known as Dinah and Friends and remained so until it ended its run in 1980. The show's announcer was Johnny Gilbert.",
