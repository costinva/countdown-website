Who is the Boss in the House? will teach people to find a common language with animals and cope with the most difficult problems.Each plot has a real story: about dogs, about cats or about exotic animals. Heroes are ordinary people who have encountered difficulties in the behavior of pets.The presenters - professional zoopsychologists - are ready to do anything to find the cause of the problem and help people eliminate it. Pets sometimes have to be taught, sometimes treated, but every time their owners must be educated.",
