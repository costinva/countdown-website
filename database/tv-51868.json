  "overview": "The daily infotainment magazine reports on everyday and current phenomena and explains them entertainingly and in simple terms. Questions such as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"How does the human body work?\" or \"What forces are at work in a car crash?\" are explored. It presents 'wonders of nature', people with special abilities or even areas and places with special or mysterious significance. The magazine presents curious and useful inventions, gets to the bottom of idioms and terms, tests generally accepted knowledge for its truth content, tries out officially forbidden things and presents new trends on the Internet. The \"Word of the Week,\" the \"Number of the Day,\" spectacular and daring experiments, practical tips and advice, as well as instructions for copying, rebuilding and reliving are further elements of the show, which has been hosted by Aiman Abdallah from the start.",
