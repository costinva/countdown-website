  "overview": "Even if hardship and misfortune always accompany life, the youths who have walked with their middle finger raised now seek someone to lean on wholeheartedly, wanting to find a person to rely on as if they were to fall. Dreaming of becoming a film director one day, Kim Moo Bi, an assistant director, wants to follow in her father's footsteps, who worked as a filming crew member. After entering the film industry, she quietly honed her skills, not drawing attention to herself in the eyes of others. On the other hand, Ko Gyeom rose from being a supporting actor to becoming a film critic. He meets Moo Bi on the set of an interview film, eventually starting their own love story.",
