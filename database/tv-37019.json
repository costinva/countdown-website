  "overview": "People Magazine Investigates: Cults explores how destructive and terrifying cults can be to cult members and their families. Each episode dives deep inside a twisted American cult, building to that pivotal moment when blind worship turns violent and even deadly. From Jonestown to the Army of God, People reporters are on the front lines, revealing the untold stories of power-crazed cult leaders using mind control, sex, and violence to manipulate and dominate followers. Each episode follows People's trusted journalists as they doggedly investigate the evolution of these cults, expose their bizarre and brutal day-to-day rituals, and speak first-hand to survivors who narrowly escaped lives of misery to put their cult nightmares finally behind them.",
