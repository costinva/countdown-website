  "overview": "Jubei helps the Japanese government to take control over a city that was under christian leadership. It was ruled by someone who could be seen as the new Jesus. But since he died, he has been reborn now, but not as a new Jesus but as the devil himself. It is up to Jubei to take him out before the world has become one giant massacre.",
