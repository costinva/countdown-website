  "overview": "Rafa Farías was a boxer, and his pregnant wife died in a car crash. Reasoning that his wife died because the ambulance did not arrive to the site in time, he ends his boxing career and becomes a nurse instead. He consented with the removal of his late wife's eyes for organ donation. Those benefited Marcela Ríos, who had become blind during a street attack. In present day, both of them work at the same clinic. She is married to Javier Mansilla, who had caused the crash by checking his mobile phone while driving, and then escaped without helping the crash victim.",
