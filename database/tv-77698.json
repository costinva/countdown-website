  "overview": "From wars and rumors of war abroad to the rise of anti-Christian, \"woke\" ideology here at home, it's clear that Americans are living in perilous and unprecedented times. Some would even say that we're witnessing Bible prophecy unfold in real time. Stakelbeck Tonight makes sense of these stunning developments through a bold and biblical lens. Each night, host Erick Stakelbeck takes viewers around the world—from Jerusalem to London to Washington, D.C., and points beyond—with cutting edge commentary, analysis and interviews focusing on these world-changing events and why it all matters to you. Stakelbeck Tonight shines a light in the darkness and reminds viewers that even in these uncertain times, God is still in control and has a great plan for His Church.",
