  "overview": "The Good Ship Murder is set aboard a luxury cruise liner touring everyone's favorite Mediterranean holiday hotspots bubbling with intrigue, rivalries, glamour, money and class divides – but its new cabaret singer, ex detective Jack Grayling, soon discovers there are also more sinister elements below the surface. On a cruise out of Southampton, Jack meets newly promoted First Officer, Kate Woods. Fierce and ambitious, she's a woman in a man's world with plenty to prove. After a passenger is found murdered in their first port of call, Kate's dream of her own command is thrown into Jeopardy and Jack finds himself thrust back into his former life as a detective. What follows is a wave of murder mysteries – each set against the backdrop of a different stunning coastal destination where the ship has dropped anchor.",
