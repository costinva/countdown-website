  "overview": "The show's heroines are women who suspect their lovers of infidelity. The program's hosts — a psychologist, a lawyer, and a hacker — help the heroines test their suspicions. They organize surveillance, install hidden cameras, and test the men's endurance by sending seductive temptresses to them. If the fact of infidelity is confirmed, the heroine decides what to do with the unfaithful lover: forgive, punish, or pretend that nothing happened.",
