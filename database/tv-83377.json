  "overview": "A cheerful and passionate youth drama about associate lawyers who go to work at Seocho-dong Law Town every day. It is a realistic story of 'real' lawyers who have stepped into the real world and will portray the coming of age of lawyers in charge of cases that can happen in and around our daily lives. An Ju Hyeong is a 9th-year lawyer with a high level of fact-violence logic. He became a lawyer simply because he found logic and cases interesting. From the beginning, he did not have the 'meaning' that lawyers protect the weak, implement justice, and change the world. He is just a 9th office worker. He has been a regular at the same company for 9 years without changing jobs, and his work is at its peak as his seniority. He is a veteran in the associate industry who has set a new associate salary record but does not open a practice because it is too much trouble. For Ju Hyeong, the peaceful wall of the 'workplace' begins to crack. Kang Hui Ji is a 2nd-year lawyer at Johwa Law Firm. She believes that \" if you change one person's life, you have changed that person's world.\" Whether she is lacking or overflowing, she is confident and honest.",
