  "overview": "No shoes in the hall. No coffee in the pot. He was supposed to come in late, but when she woke that morning he was just Gone. As the day went on, her unanswered calls grew more frantic, and her unease became panic. Something was wrong but the truth is even darker than it looks. Gone features twisted true stories of individuals who go missing and leave a trail of secrets in their wake and of frantic loved ones left behind who are often not who they seem.",
