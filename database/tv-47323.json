  "overview": "A new daily fitness show from Ray Lally, the Today Show fitness expert, and Dáithí Ó Sé is coming to RTÉ One.At this stage, most of us have settled into somewhat of a new routine while social distancing and self-isolating and, hopefully, that routine includes a bit of physical activity to keep the mind and body healthy.However, you'd be forgiven if, by now, you find yourself losing motivation - especially when you have to work out alone.Well, fear not because Kerry man Dáithí Ó Sé is here to put a pep in your step and bring a bit of craic to your daily workout.",
