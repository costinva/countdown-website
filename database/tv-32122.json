  "overview": "Brides spend up to $75,000 for an Amsale bridal gown and the women who work for Amsale are just as extraordinary as the dresses themselves. Every day, they deal with dozens of fittings, dress disasters, and the non-stop pressure of pleasing some of the most discriminating Manhattan brides. Outside of work, the girls serve as each other's best friends and support systems as they face their own relationships, their upcoming nuptials, and life as a young woman. It's all in a day's work when you're an Amsale Girl.",
