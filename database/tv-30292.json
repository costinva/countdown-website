  "overview": "Helping a family cope with the loss of a loved one takes a very special individual. Discovery Fit &amp; Health explores one of the most unique funeral homes in America on Funeral Boss. This six-part series introduces CEO and patriarch Bill Harris, an expert in the funeral industry and the heart and soul behind this family business. A perfectionist, he insists on running the business a certain way - his way, but with three sons and a daughter working for him, he's hoping to pass that dedication on to the next generation. Despite all the hustle and high drama, one thing they all agree on is that the funeral business with its constant focus on the grief of loss and the celebration of life is intense, emotional and about as high-pressure as any industry can get. Each episode documents the Harris clan as they help new families on the emotional journey of saying goodbye to a loved one.",
