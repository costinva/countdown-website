  "overview": "Suddenly, and without warning, all teenage girls in the world develop the power to electrocute people at will. It's hereditary, it's inbuilt, and it can't be taken away from them. Over our first season and beyond, the series will follow its cast of remarkable characters from London to Arizona, Nigeria to Moldova, as the Power evolves from a tingle in teenagers' collarbones to a complete reversal of the power balance of the world. Everything's about to change, for everyone.",
