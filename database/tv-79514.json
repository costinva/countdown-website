  "overview": "Alderney, a tiny island in the English Channel, is the site of one of the darkest and most mysterious chapters in World War II. Given the sinister codename 'Adolf Island', Alderney became a preoccupation for Hitler and was transformed into one of the most heavily fortified places on earth. Away from prying eyes, the Nazis also established a concentration camp, the only one on British soil, amid the idyllic scenery of woodlands and silver sand beaches. But how many people were murdered there and why were the Nazi killers never brought to justice?Over two 60-minute episodes, Hitler's British Island will reveal the startling death toll - far in excess of the number recorded by wartime investigators. And following painstaking research by expert historians, the show will reveal how Nazi war criminals were allowed to go free, with the reason covered up for 80 years.",
