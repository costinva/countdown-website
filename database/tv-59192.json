  "overview": "Summer Love is an anthology series which sees eight very different sets of people rent the same beachside holiday house. Eight different writing teams bring eight different stories to life, each connected through the house and through the theme of love. Summer Love captures the collision between the dreamy enchantment of the beach and the clumsy reality of humans on holiday. It explores the anonymity, the possibility, and the escape that we all feel, alongside the ever-present threat of sand in the sheets.",
