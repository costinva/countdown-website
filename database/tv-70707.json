  "overview": "New Zealand, the remote archipelago at the end of the world, is an evolutionary treasure trove. Species have been able to develop and survive here undisturbed for eons, which in other parts of the world would have long since succumbed to the pressure of competition, especially from mammals. Primeval reptiles, grotesque ratites and bizarre underwater creatures live here and in neighboring Australia. This series undertakes ambitious expeditions to get the animals in front of the camera and also chronicles the dangers they have faced since the arrival of humans on the volcanically and tectonically shaped islands.Â ",
