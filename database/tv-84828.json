  "overview": "The heroes of the series are clients of an ordinary beauty salon \"Faces\". As usual, when they come to the salon, they tell their, sometimes the most incredible, stories of Love. Some of them are impossible to believe, others will turn out to be just a figment of their imagination and not all will end with a happy ending. The beauty salon will become that \"magical\" place where everyone will reveal their most intimate love secrets: different and at the same time close to each other. And the grateful listeners will be the visitors of the salon and, of course, its employees.",
