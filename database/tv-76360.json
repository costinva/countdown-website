  "overview": "STAX: Soulsville U.S.A. tells the story of an underdog record label comprised of Black and white collaborators who ushered in the groundbreaking, industry-altering soul music of Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s, The Staple Singers, Sam &amp; Dave and many others that defined a generation. Driven by instinct and defying the notion that Black artists needed to be \"made marketable,\" the Memphis-based label went from ultimate outsider to one of the most influential producers of Black music – finding its place inside the broader mainstream record industry. Stax became more than a record label; it transformed into a beacon of Black freedom. It is a quintessentially American story of an audacious group of individuals who dared to make their own music on their own terms creating an institution that has continued to help define our culture long after the label itself has gone.",
