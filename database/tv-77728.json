  "overview": "Spouses Igor Yurich and Tatiana, as well as their son Federico Polupanov, are not an ordinary family. They live in their own universe, where you can dig a hole without a shovel, have lunch without food and escape from prison without getting into it. Therefore, when Natalia, a social worker, appears on the doorstep, the Polupanovs refuse the offer to move to more comfortable conditions under the state renovation program — they feel good here. Since the Polupanovs are absolutely not interested in money, Natalia uses any methods that will help to relocate the family: from fictional ghosts in the house and inviting guardianship authorities to organizing a revolt of the village against the Polupanovs. But the desperate attempts of the social worker to free up the living space are broken every time by new oddities of the family.",
