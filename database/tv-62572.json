This is a continuation of that story, a whole Bucketheads series that follows Nova Squad during the final days of the Empire leading up to the battle of Jakku. The series will feature five 20-30 minute episodes chronicling their original story as it unfolds during one of the most interesting backdrops in all of Star Wars.",
