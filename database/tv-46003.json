  "overview": "Kanal 5 is proud to offer Sweden's best comedy. On RAW Comedy Club there are no rules and the comedians themselves set the limits. - \"We have no censorship, but more importantly it's fun and not raw just for the sake of it\", says Martin Anderson, the owner of RAW Comedy Club. In each program he presents the cream of Sweden's elite comedians and international stars that will go up on stage and do what they want. It can therefore be time to warn sensitive viewers because a lot of the jokes are not directly housebroken. But RAW Comedy Club is more than just raw and boundless humor. RAW is a pure stand-up club where the audience can take on the mood in the room. RAW is simply young, new and hot. Did we forget to say that it's really fucking fun, too?",
