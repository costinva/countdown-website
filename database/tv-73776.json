  "overview": "Magnus Uggla and his daughter Agnes embark on a journey together to meet themselves, each other and the world. He was born in the 50s and she in the 90s and some believe that these two generations are the ones that are the furthest apart. Was everything really better before or have some changes even been for the better? In six episodes, father and daughter explore everything from the nuclear family to spirituality, via aging and beauty to emigration, dating and popular culture.",
