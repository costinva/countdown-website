  "overview": "Kristian Valen gives us breakfast-TV for B-humans in the best airtime. Valen plays the always tired and unprepared showhost Nils Georg, that takes you through half an hour of energic parodies of celebrities and TV-shows. This is a show with music, news, sport and last but not least a TV-kitchen with a new celebrity-chef every week.",
