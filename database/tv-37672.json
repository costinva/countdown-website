  "overview": "In Sideswiped from YouTube Originals, a lifetime of saying no has left a workaholic single and miserable on her 35th birthday, causing her to plunge into the hellish world of Tinder by dating all 252 of her matches. Spurred on by her younger sister— a married woman experiencing a seven-year itch— the women are joined by their online dating savvy mother, leading to a multi-generational comedy about relationships – both romantic and familial.",
