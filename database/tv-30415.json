  "overview": "The Virtues is a drama series that's equal parts unlikely love story and an exploration of the conflict between sin and virtue. The story revolves around Joseph, a moral yet troubled man who's lost everything. He finds himself compelled to travel to Ireland to confront demons from a childhood spent in the care system, resulting in savage and brutal consequences. He also crosses paths with a fiery, yet guarded woman, Dinah, who's hiding a secret.",
