  "overview": "In a town in Castilla, endless cereal fields rocked by the wind extend beyond where it can be seen. There is a quiet municipality where the slaughterhouse of Francisco is located, an entrepreneur who is dedicated to the processing of meat, imports cheap and low quality pigs from Portugal and then sell them. In the slaughterhouse works his brother-in-law Alfonso, a veterinarian by profession, a weak and somewhat cowardly man who in the background is tired of looking the other way certifying animals of doubtful quality and that any other would throw back. And all why? Alfonso does not want his wife María José to hear about a little secret from the past that would ruin their quiet marriage. This allows Francisco to keep his brother-in-law in a permanent blackmail, covering his illegal actions. What Alfonso does not know is that, in addition to validating that meat of doubtful origin, a certain number of these Portuguese animals carry drugs.",
