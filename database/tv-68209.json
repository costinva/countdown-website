  "overview": "Yoshino Michi is 32 years old. She's been married for five years, but hasn't had sex for the last two. It's not as if she doesn't get along with her husband, it's just that the sex part is lacking. It was a bit unexpected, but one night when she when drinking with her colleague, Niina Makoto, she wound up confessing that her marriage had turned sexless. And then, a shocked Niina responded \"My marriage is sexless, too,\" and smiled with a lonely look in his eyes.",
