  "overview": "A psychological thriller set in the crossfire of the 1997 historical battle between world chess champion Garry Kasparov and IBM's supercomputer Deep Blue, Rematch is a high-pressure confrontation between man and machine, a war of minds, both on and off the chess board. Based on a true story, Rematch takes us on a gripping journey inside the world of high-level chess competition via one of the greatest man vs. machine matches ever to be played. The event was so important, it prompted the New York Times to print: The future of humanity is on the line.Â ",
