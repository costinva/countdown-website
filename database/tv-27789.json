  "overview": "When social connector Larry Sims invites six of his friends from different phases in his life on a luxury vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, no one knows what to expect, especially since most of his friends know next-to-nothing about the other guests. While Larry is the common thread who ties them together, they each have very different personalities and relationships with their BFF. As Larry's worlds collide, fireworks erupt and he realizes there was a valid reason he hadn't mixed them up before. With betrayal and jealousy lurking at every confrontation, keeping the peace among friends he previously kept apart will be no easy task. With cameras rolling 24/7, secrets can't be hidden and nothing stays private as old wounds resurface, new relationships form, and friendships are permanently altered on Invite Only Cabo.",
