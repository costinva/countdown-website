  "overview": "Men kill in rage, to control, to steal, to exert powerâ€¦so why and how do women kill? So often, it's about lost love, a desire for wealth, revenge. This true crime series investigates the stories of the women who kill...how they kill by fire, poison, hiring a hitman or with guns or knives...often different but sometimes chillingly like male homicide. From interviews with those close to Lady Killers, psychologists and criminologists, to dramatic reconstruction, this series answers the key questions as to why women take the lives of those close to them.",
