  "overview": "Eco moda is a sequel television series of Betty the Ugly in 2001 RCN. It recounts what has happened during Armando and Betty's married life, as well as new little stories with their parents and new characters. This continuation does not revolve around the love story between Betty and Armando, although of course they will keep the most attention, it is just that in this installment all the characters will have a greater appreciation of what happens to them in their lives and what they are going to face. Because of this most of the episodes have no greater connection with each other, being like small stories but of course without losing the main plot: the future relationship between Eco moda and Fashion Group.",
