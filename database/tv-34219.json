  "overview": "Two Sides is a landmark limited four-part docu-series exploring watershed moments for law enforcement and the Black community at the crossroads between life and death. Executive produced by Academy Award(R) winner Viola Davis, Julius Tennon and Lemuel Plummer with narration by Davis, each one-hour episode of Two Sides offers an in-depth, comprehensive look into disturbing cases of officer-involved deaths. Focusing on four headline-grabbing fatal police encounters during 2014 - 2015, the series analyzes and presents multiple points of view of the highly charged cases involving Eric Garner (New York), Ezell Ford (California), John Crawford (Ohio), and Sandra Bland (Texas). Their tragic deaths sparked grassroots social justice movements such as Black Lives Matter, inspired protests by high profile personalities, and immortalized their names as tragic figures in the polarizing debate on police brutality and race.",
