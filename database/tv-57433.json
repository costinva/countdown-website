  "overview": "Moody and Pegg was a bittersweet British sitcom. Derek Waring played Roland Moody, a newly divorced 42-year-old junk/antique dealer greatly anticipating freedom from matrimonial ties. Judy Cornwell was cast as Daphne Pegg, plain spinster and dedicated civil servant in her early thirties who leaves her home in Bolton after realising that her office boss will never agree to marry her. Owing to a rogue estate agent's dealings, finds that a man, Moody, also has a valid lease arrangement for the property she acquires. Unable to work out who is the squatter, they agree to be feuding partners.",
