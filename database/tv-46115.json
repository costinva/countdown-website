  "overview": "Sarah Haywood is one of the most reputable wedding planners alive. She's spent the last 20 years creating some of the most elaborate and costly weddings in the world and knows that planning a wedding is a minefield. Because when it's supposed to be \"the best day of your life\" every single detail is loaded with significance.Now Sarah is on a mission to help ordinary British couples as they navigate their own wedding planning pitfalls. With her inimitable, take-no-prisoners style, Sarah's on hand to mete out her no-nonsense advice and share her expertise, even – and sometimes particularly – when the couples feel they know best. From an overstretched bride-to-be whose guests don't know they're coming to a wedding, to a detail-obsessed groomzilla whose husband-to-be can't spend another minute discussing how a ribbon should be tied, Sarah's experience is invaluable as she steers these \"careering-towards-catastrophe\" wedding plans in the direction of the perfect day the couples are dreaming of.",
