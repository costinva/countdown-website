  "overview": "After being fired from the soap opera Days to Remember, down on his luck, eccentric, self-centered actor Simon Ferguson moves into Manhattan's Metropolitan Hotel, which is run by ex-wife Hadley Martin, whom he was married to 20 years prior... for twelve days. Despite her initial exasperation with her ex, Hadley again succumbs to the \"Ferguson charm\", as do all of those around her. Simon reluctantly plays role model to Hadley's children from a different marriage: precocious 7 1‚ÅÑ2-year-old Daniel and angst-ridden teen Gwen. The hotel's psychotic Greek chef, Yorgo Galfanikos, also looks up to Simon, having been a fan of his soap opera and films. Also seen are Rose, the hotel's assistant manager, Robert McSwain, the hotel's main investor, Tommy Sutton, a popular jock Gwen fawns over, and Jesse, a geek who is smitten with Gwen.",
