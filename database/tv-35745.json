  "overview": "Each episode of Reality Obsessed has Murtz Jaffer on the hunt for answers to a particular â€˜big picture' question in the realm of reality television. He'll explore how reality cameras affect the outcome of a complete geek hooking up with a hot babe; how casting directors find the perfect mix of angels and monsters for the next big hit, or what happens after contestants' 15 minutes of fame are up? It's a full blown celebration of everything reality!",
