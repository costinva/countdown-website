  "overview": "An ambitious team of classic car hunters scour deeper into Canada's Northern wilderness than any car hunter has gone before. Their mission is to recover rare vehicles fabled to be hiding in the bush, before the cars are lost forever to history. Led by Matt Sager, the team travel by air in his 1948 Stinson and by land to extract these vehicles from their forgotten resting places. Each team member plays a crucial role: the pilot, Jess; Steve \"the wrench\"; autobody expert, Dave; and crane operator, Lee. Together they achieve the impossible, uncovering rare automotive gems and preserving the cars and the stories of the places and the people who have lived there for generations.   ",
