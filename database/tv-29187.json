  "overview": "Veterinarian Mark Evans uses modern technology to tackle three predators: the white shark, Nile crocodile and polar bear. In Western Australia, sharks have killed seven people within a three-year span; in Hudson Bay, polar bears have caused havoc in isolated villages; and in Namibia's Chobe River, crocodiles have grown in size and number, which increases attacks against humans. In the series, the vet strives to improve the safety of both the animals and those who live around them.",
