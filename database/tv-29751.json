  "overview": "700 Club Interactive is a place dedicated to prayer, uplifting stories, positive Christian news, encouragement and community. We are a TV show, but more than that, we are a movement â€“ connecting the dots between faith and culture and addressing the hard questions like: what's my purpose? How am I living out God's love? What's my role as a Christian in today's culture? In the face of war and chaos and uncertainty, how do we keep our hope? How do we live out our faith? We are a diverse team committed to reaching the world with the Gospel. For unbelievers, we want to show them the power and love of Jesus. For existing Christians, we want to both challenge and inspire them to grow in their faith. We are storytellers with the media as our platform. Join us for honest conversations, unique perspectives from Christian leaders and thinkers, daily encouragement, inspiring stories and news from a Christian perspective.",
