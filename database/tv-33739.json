  "overview": "On the morning of 14 December 1825, members of Russia's top noble \nfamilies assembled armed troops in Senate Square, St. Petersburg in an attempt to start a revolution against the Tsar. By nightfall, however, \nafter unsuccessful negotiations and several rounds of artillery fire, it\n was all over. The organizers of the revolt, later called the \nDecembrists, were arrested and accused of high treason. Five of them \nwere sentenced to death by hanging, the others condemned to penal \nservitude. Although the plot was a complete failure, it was to have an \nimportant and lasting effect on social and economic life in Russia for \nat least the next fifty years.",
