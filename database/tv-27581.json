  "overview": "The Wonder of Britain is a documentary series that celebrates some of the most impressive natural and manmade wonders that make Britain great. Julia Bradbury embarks on a stunning 12,000-mile journey around the country to some of Britain's most spectacular locations and chooses some of the greatest assets she believes we should be most proud of.Taking in our industrial, natural and royal heritage, Julia's scope encompasses rolling countryside, dramatic coastline, bird-filled archipelagos and deep dizzying gorges to beautifully eclectic buildings; from grand stately homes to cramped industrial era terraces. She investigates our industrial past and learns about how our engineering achievements re-shaped the world. Beautifully captured using the latest cameras and technology, combined with aerial and time-lapse photography, the Wonder of Britain is vividly brought to life.",
