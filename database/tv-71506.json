  "overview": "Summer, St. Petersburg of the XXI century. Student Rodion Raskolnikov is exhausted by lack of money, unemployment and thoughts about the meaninglessness of his existence. But the idea is growing in his mind that some people \"have the right\" to do the most vile acts if they make great discoveries and move the world forward. To test the theory on himself, he kills an old woman microcreditor. Investigator Porfiry Petrovich is on the trail of Raskolnikov, who wants to extract a sincere confession from him.",
