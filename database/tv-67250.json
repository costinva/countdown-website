  "overview": "Mishima Kanji is a reporter for the Weekly Times, which mainly deals with gossip. He feels a sense of emptiness and discomfort as he spends his days chasing celebrity scandals, without a shred of the journalistic spirit he aspired to. One day, Mishima goes to Amagasaki to pick up a certain person under the direction of chief editor Nagasawa Asuka. Nagasawa sends him off as a chance to fulfill Mishima's former wish to \"see a world you wouldn't see if you lived a normal life\", but what awaits him is Keijiro Kihara, a man who is now a renowned figure in all areas of the underworld, politics, and entertainment, as well as an urban legend among informers, known as \"Informer\".  ",
