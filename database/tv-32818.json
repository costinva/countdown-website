  "overview": "Each day there are hundreds of thousands of pounds up for grabs, but only if you can avoid the dreaded killer balls that have the power to turn thousands of pounds into pennies in seconds. Presented by Jasper Carrott, Golden Balls is a game of luck, intuition and barefaced bluff. Contestants must do whatever they can - be it lie, cheat or play it straight to avoid being voted off in each round and make it through the final showdown. Golden Balls has the tension and game play of poker and the chance-based jeopardy of Deal or No Deal. Split or steal what would you do?",
