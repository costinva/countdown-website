  "overview": "André Hazes was followed by cameras for two years, during perhaps the most difficult period of his life. He is at a crossroads where he struggles with fears and demons. André enters into battle, especially with himself, and that involves some rigorous decisions. We see an extremely vulnerable and honest André. All masks must come off.",
