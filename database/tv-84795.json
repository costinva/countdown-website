  "overview": "Sľub, set in the 1980s, will transport viewers, through strong stories full of emotions, humor, and drama, to a turning point forty years ago, when jeans could only be found in Tuzex, Spartakiad was practiced in free time, people knew that there was a different world beyond the borders, and the word emigration was only spoken in whispers... The plot takes place in an elementary school, which intertwines not only the destinies of students and teachers, but also entire families, which are marked by events in our country and in the surrounding world.",
