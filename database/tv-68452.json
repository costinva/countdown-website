  "overview": "One woman goes out with fourteen bachelors. So where's the twist? Some of the men are gay and some are straight. If she ends up with a straight guy, the couple splits a one million dollar prize. If her \"gaydar\" is off and she picks a gay guy, he gets the entire one million. The question is... does this woman have a finely tuned gaydar, or does it need repairing?",
