  "overview": "In Battle of the Decades, three teams take on a series of challenges for the chance to make it to the final round. In round one it is all about nostalgia as host Jonathan Bennett reveals the contents of a time capsule which includes mandatory ingredients and a cooking gadget from a particular year that must be used in the first dish. The chefs will have to employ everything from an electric grill to a fondue pot to accomplish their missions. In round two, the remaining teams have to put their own spin on viral food trends like smiley fries and spicy vodka pasta. Then, in round three, the final team standing must face off against each other to create their version of a timeless dish like Chicken Kiev and Beef Wellington, for the ultimate test of the decades. In the end, only one chef will walk away with $10,000.",
