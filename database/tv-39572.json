  "overview": "VICELAND premieres the new docuseries Kentucky Ayahuasca. For centuries, indigenous cultures of the Amazon have brewed the plant-based medicine known as Ayahuasca, a strong entheogenic tea with hallucinogenic properties that many believe can help address every manner of trauma and illness stored in the body and mind, allowing the individual to heal and recover in a vastly accelerated way not typically seen with conventional forms of therapy. The show follows Steve Hupp, a former serial bank robber whose life was changed when a robbery went wrong and he found himself sharing a prison cell with a Peruvian shaman named Guadalupe who upon release, introduced him to the healing potential of Ayahuasca. Now, Hupp and his family have opened a retreat deep in the Bible Belt of Kentucky, attracting people from far and wide seeking enlightenment, salvation or healing from any number of afflictions from depression and PTSD, to recovery from emotional or physical abuse and addictions of all kinds. Hupp and his family guide them through ceremonies and their experiences with the medicine, to help them find the healing and answers that they've yet to find.",
