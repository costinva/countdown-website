  "overview": "Emmy's mother died and she hates what she's wearing. Emmy knows she could live her best life, if her dead mother would JUST. STOP. TALKING. Fern pops into Emmy's life to question her lipstick and life choices, as only a mother can. Even death can't stop Fern from being fabulousâ€¦ and disappointed. Sure, Emmy would've liked to hike the Appalachian Trail after her mom died, but work's been really busy. She wants to make peace with her mother, move to the other side of grief, but how do you get over someone who is so present?",
