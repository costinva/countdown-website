  "overview": "Paul and Léa should never have met. But ever since, they've been irresistibly drawn to each other. Raphaëlle and Gabriel, two angels who are complete opposites, are forced to team up to put everything back in order and prevent these two humans from falling in love. If the angels fail, ambitious Raphaëlle can kiss her promotion to archangel goodbye. As for the swindler Gabriel, he'll be deposed and must spend eternity on Earth.",
