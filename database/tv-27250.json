  "overview": "Would You Rather? A popular game that has taken the country — and social media — by storm. So big, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler kicked off the Golden Globes with a friendly game of Would You Rather … Colin Farrell or Colin Firth? Ed Norton or Mark Ruffalo?Whether you're playing PG versions with your family or R-rated versions at the local bar, the game has taken on a life of its own. And now, Nat Geo WILD is the first network to get into the fray, letting viewers decide what programming they want to watch with the first-ever Would You RatherWILD Wednesdays in February.Viewers decide if they would rather watch tiny or big animals, furry or scaly ones, ones that swim or slither, or ones that live in a hot or cold climate.",
