  "overview": "Shrimad Ramayan brings to life the timeless Hindu epic, the Ramayana, with a deep commitment to authenticity, cultural reverence and contemporary sensibility. The epic narrative of the Ramayana is rooted in the two words, 'Ram' and 'Ayana.' 'Ram' represents the human incarnation of Lord Vishnu, while 'Ayana' signifies a journey. Thus, the Ramayana unfolds through the voyage of Ram, a mortal who ascended to become Purushottam, the paragon among men, transcending his own inherent limitations.",
