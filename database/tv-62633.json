  "overview": "The new series continues the Pretty Series' conceptual motifs of song, dance, and fashion, and it also adds the theme of magic. Middle-school girl Matsuri Hibino loves festivals, and she dreams of one day being able to star in \"PriMagi,\" a magic-like form of stage entertainment borne from song, dance and fashion. That day arrives when the hyper-spirited, trouble-making magician Myamu arrives from the magical realm and scouts Matsuri for PriMagi. Together, the two compete with rivals to rise to the top of PriMagi.",
