  "overview": "The show is unique in the world of television. Yes there are guests that share their stories and world class experts who share their knowledge, but it is the host that makes it so special. Every episode of the Ask Dr. Nandi show is a glimpse into the world of Dr. Partha Nandi. Airing on 7 networks, in 90 million homes in the US and in 79 countries, Ask Dr. Nandi is without a doubt a global success. Dr. Nandi's approach to discussing health care, fitness, nutrition and lifestyle not only incorporates compassion but also a sense of community, purpose and most importantly spirituality. His tremendous ability to connect with others allows him to develop a bond between himself and his guests, his studio audience, the viewers at home and online. Dr. Nandi has an uncanny ability to make his fans feel like they are truly part of the \"Nandi Family\" and it is this reason why the show has an extremely loyal following. There are many shows on television that are informative but how many television shows can be life INSPIRING?",
