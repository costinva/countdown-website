  "overview": "The rivalry between two famous actresses begins when the seemingly perfect married life of Phatchanin turns into a bitter pill. Ingdao seeks revenge, aiming to shatter Phatchanin's life over an old grudge. But the game doesn't involve only themâ€”an ambitious businessman with his own vendetta enters the scene, stirring emotions and complicating the stakes, along with a resilient girl nearly led astray by a revenge she didn't cause.",
