  "overview": "Ali, a Palestinian, and Sa'ar, an Israeli, met at a peace camp as children, and grew up together in war-torn Jerusalem. Their own personal tragedies made them as close as brothers. When the second intifada strikes, the two best friends suddenly find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict: Ali must abandon his dream of becoming a surgeon to join an armed militia in Nablus, while Sa'ar is recruited to a secret Israeli intelligence unit leading the search for a mysterious commander of the Palestinian militia. Jenny, an American war journalist who loves them both, will have to pick a side.",
