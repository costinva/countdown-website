  "overview": "Optics follows two whip-smart 20-something women who are unexpectedly promoted to run crisis management PR firm Fritz &amp; Randell, after the death of office patriarch Frank Fritz. As they battle weekly public relations crises from celebrities, sports stars and corporate titans, and power challenges from veteran PR flack Ian Randell, they slowly come to realise that their firm might have a scandal brewing of its own, and start to wonder: have they been set up to fail?",
