  "overview": "Nine people were selected to participate in the show, who had no idea what they had to do and what the essence of the game was. They were placed in an underground bunker, in which there was no connection with the outside world: phones, watches and other devices were prohibited. The winner of $1 million was chosen by the participants themselves by voting (you cannot vote for yourself). In order for a participant to become a winner, everyone else had to vote for him at the same time. The essence of the game is that between voting, participants tell others about themselves and how they would spend their winnings (and they can lie). Based on what they hear, the rest decide who they will vote for.",
