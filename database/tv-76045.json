  "overview": "Bua comes from a wealthy, Chinese-Thai family in the soy sauce industry. Her mom is constantly longing for respect within the hi-so community and forces Bua to marry Chatchai, a man who could get them there. Bua is a sweet person but cannot fathom marrying a man she does not love and barely knows, so she and her best friend Cartoon try to find a way out. Coincidentally, they overhear her brother Petch talking on the phone with his friend Ran—Bua's childhood crush—who is in need of a woman to masquerade as his girlfriend! This inspired the duo to formulate a plan.",
