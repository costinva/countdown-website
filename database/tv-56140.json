  "overview": "Revolution in Colour tells the story of Ireland's struggle for independence during the early decades of the 20th Century. For the first time the years leading up to British general election of 1918 is not shown in black and white but in colour, creating a powerful emotional connection with the people, the personalities, and the past. It brings Irish history alive.",
