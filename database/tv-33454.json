  "overview": "Let's Get a Good Thing Going is a series that gives passionate local people the chance to pitch for the funds they want to use the positive projects that will benefit the community. Each episode will visit a different town, village or district where individuals or groups who are keen to start improving their local communities pitch their ideas, community group projects and social enterprises to a room full of locals for a cash fund, that the community themselves have contributed to. Once they've heard all the pitches, the audience cast their votes.The pitch with the most support will be awarded the funds that will allow them to start work on their project immediately - with follow ups a few weeks later to check in on progress.",
