  "overview": "Eight party-loving Brits, all a liability on a night out, are challenged to spend the summer on the other side of the bar-running one of Zante's busiest party spots.The eight hedonists all think they're coming for a summer of fun, but have really been nominated by their friends-who are sick of their antics on nights out-to successfully run the bar at the height of holiday season, doing everything from mixing cocktails to cleaning toilets. If they can work together and resist temptation they could share a big cash prize. But that's easier said than done for these hilarious Hot Messes.",
