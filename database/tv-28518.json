  "overview": "Laura Gibson is a big-city lawyer who makes a seachange and moves to the small town of Pearl Bay for a new life. Pearl Bay has been almost completely cut off from the outside world since the Port Deakin Bridge was closed 5 years previously but most of the residents like it this way. The town's residents, however, are stranger than the cityfolk and Laura soon learns that the town lives on friendship and gossip.",
