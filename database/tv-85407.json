  "overview": "Roma and Anya were married for about five years, the candy-bouquet period was replaced by the harsh everyday life of family life. They realized that they had to move on, but in different directions. However, their mutual friends — young parents Katya and Lyosha, as well as bachelors Oleg and Elya — disagree with their decision to divorce, because Roma and Anya are the core of their party, without them the company will fall apart. Dinners together, trips to nature, shared birthdays — all this may come to an end. But Roma, apparently, has not cooled his feelings for his ex-wife. The casual phrase \"I don't like it, let's get divorced\" turned his usual lifestyle around. Anya alone, feeling free, plunges into the maelstrom of new relationships and tries to find herself in this world.",
