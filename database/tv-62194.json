  "overview": "In Hungry for Answers, scholar, award-winning writer, restaurateur and cookbook author Caroline Randall Williams travels the country uncovering the often untold Black stories behind some of America's classic and emblematic food and spirits. From the spicy, crisp flavors of Nashville Hot Chicken to the warm, dulcet taste of Tennessee Whiskey, Williams is out to uncover the origin stories of these quintessential American offerings, as well as surface the truth when it comes to the equity, or in most cases inequity, regarding the recognition and reward, for the true founding contributors throughout history. Hungry for Answers is a food show, but it is not just a food show, it is a Black food show with an ambitious endeavor to serve up a healthy dose of history with each delicious bite and sip explored.  ",
