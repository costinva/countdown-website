  "overview": "The series tells about the work of a special police unit dealing with domestic violence. The four main characters help women, children, and even men who suffer from tyranny, beatings, humiliation, and other forms of oppression by their loved ones. The heroines of the series will get into difficult and dangerous situations, saving lives and restoring justice. Every woman in the four has also been through violence: each has its own story, a skeleton in the closet, and a strong motivation to do just that.",
