  "overview": "FEDS will take viewers deep inside America's most elite crime-fighting agency, the FBI. The series, through gripping interviews with active-duty FBI agents, will detail high-profile, dangerous, and unusual cases with added insight from informants, undercover operatives, and victims. Offering unparalleled perspective, Feds reveals the twists and turns of each case, as agents let their guard down and for the first time, bring us into their private world. Showcasing a variety of investigations - from infiltrating MS-13 in Boston to taking down a multimillion-dollar drug empire in Florida - Feds shows the lengths the FBI goes to protect citizens across the country. In the season premiere, FBI special agents Wayne Jackowski and Andy Kehren recount an investigation into a terrifying kidnapping of a couple that results in a heart-pounding car chase with the prime suspect.",
