  "overview": "Filmed in hundreds of locations from remote islands to busy cities, Scotland - The New Wild has been more than three years in the making. The series is full of spectacle and surprise from rutting red deer stags in the glens to battling grey seal bulls on remote islands and the beauty of the outer Hebridean Machair. Other highlights include the urban beavers of Perth, dashing peregrine falcons above the streets of Edinburgh, miniature wonders like the aphid-farming wood ants and the astonishing bog raft spider – an invertebrate that walks on water.",
