  "overview": "Halston follows the legendary fashion designer, as he leverages his single, invented name into a worldwide fashion empire that's synonymous with luxury, sex, status and fame, literally defining the era he lives in, 1970's and ‘80's New York — until a hostile takeover forces him to battle for control of his most precious asset… the name Halston itself.",
