  "overview": "Kung Faux is a cult television series. The series began in 2003 as a follow-up to a 1999 movie of the same name. Many voice-overs are done by famous hip-hop performers and personalities of the era. It features a \"mashup\" style of production, incorporating bits of, and references to, other media, such as movies, music and video games. This aesthetic echoes other contemporaneous popular culture, including mashup dance music and hip-hop tracks. The series was produced by Mic Neumann for Dubtitled Entertainment and Tommy Boy Films. Its credentials include performances by Queen Latifah, Biz Markie, and other big names of hip-hop and soul. The bread and butter of the series is edited, shortened, and remixed footage and dialogue from classic 1970s martial arts, wuxia, and kung fu films.",
