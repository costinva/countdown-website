  "overview": "Marrying Millions follows six couples who are deeply in love and hoping to marry, but come from completely different worlds. Regular people are whisked off their feet and plunged into a high-end life of riches, extravagant experiences, and glamorous trips around the globe. While it may sound like a modern-day fairytale, it's definitely not all champagne and caviar. On the road to the altar, the couples must try to bridge their vast differences and fit into each other's alien worlds.",
