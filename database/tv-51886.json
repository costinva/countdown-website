  "overview": "The young Lucie is an explosive, young Berliner without training and without a plan, who does not have herself under control, but everyone else. After she was sentenced to social hours, the city brat ends up as a kitchen helper in the Waldschloss Kleeberg, a place of longing on the idyllic A **** of the world, somewhere in Brandenburg. This is a home for children and young people who cannot or do not want to go home.",
