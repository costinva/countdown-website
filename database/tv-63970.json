  "overview": "Na Young Suk PD's ongoing 'New Journey To The West' mini series will be bringing viewers a brand new concept starting on October 23, centered around cast member Super Junior's Kyuhyun! Now, starting on October 23, Super Junior's Kyuhyun will be greeting viewers every Friday nights for 5 minutes through his alter ego, \"Drunkard Jo\"! It's currently unclear exactly what format \"Drunkard Jo\"s new mini series will take on, but Na Young Suk PD assured by the end of the teaser above that it will not involve Kyuhyun getting drunk every week, for the most part.Â ",
