  "overview": "Imagine going into a building storehouse where two professionals suddenly arrive and offer to do the job for you. Without payment. It sounds too good to be true, but that's exactly what Laila Bagge and Björn Christiernsson do in Kan vi hjälpa till? They are faced with skeptical looks as they sneak around at Swedish construction stores and ask randomly selected visitors: \"Can we help?\".",
