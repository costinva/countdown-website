  "overview": "Think you have nothing to eat at home? Think again. Fridge Wars is a new culinary competition that pits celebrity chefs against each other with the challenge of creating extraordinary meals using only the ingredients taken from the ordinary fridges of Canadian families. When cooking time's up, the first family takes their place at the dining room table and tastes each meal, scoring them on look, taste and originality — without knowing who cooked what. Those results go in the Fridge Wars vault and we do it all again with a new family and a new fridge full of challenges. This time upping the ante with a \"What the Fridge (WTF) Challenge\" that forces both chefs to adapt to a totally unique culinary crisis. With both families' scores tabulated, the final scene reveals which chef successfully created a mouth-watering masterpiece to win the Fridge Wars battle.",
