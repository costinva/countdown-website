  "overview": "The \"smart\" Su Fei and the \"ruthless\" An Ning are sympathetic of each other. They cope with the pain of Su Fei's family breakup and start a new life together. In the process of them giving each other warmth, Su Fei discovers An Ning's unknown past, making the two close friends go through a storm again. Accepting all the gifts of fate with tolerance is the sign of a woman's maturity; of course, if you offend me, I will make you pay backâ€“maybe this is the life story they have to learn.",
