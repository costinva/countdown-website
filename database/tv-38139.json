  "overview": "As the crisis on Britain's high streets grows, big brands are going bust or axing stores and thousands of jobs. Poundstretcher, one of Britain's oldest discount stores, is caught up in the maelstrom. The stakes couldn't be higher for the family-owned chain, with 6000 jobs, the family's fortune tied up in the business and the public relying on it; for many, on a budget, it's a lifeline. In need of expert help, Aziz Tayub and his three sons bring in retail guru Chris Edwards as a new CEO. His brief: to save the company.",
