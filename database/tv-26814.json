  "overview": "Caught between Moonshine seasons with idle hands, lovable still-hand Tickle stumbles upon a stash of someone else's moonshine hidden in the forest. Being the opportunist that he is, he finds himself needing ways to move the â€˜shine and cover his tracks. Enlisting the help of his trusted friends, Howard and Mo, Tickle embarks upon a series of harebrained schemes, starting with a storefront designed to distract from the otherwise illicit business. Meanwhile, they must evade several obstacles and snooping townspeople, not to mention someone that may be searching for their \"misplaced\" liquor.",
