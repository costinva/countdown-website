  "overview": "Ukrainian folk traditions are not only folklore, embroidered shirts, and national cuisine, but also everyday objects - everything that surrounded our ancestors every day. When looking for the key elements of our national identity, we should add folk architecture to this list, which gives us an idea of how Ukrainians once lived and how their identity was formed. Although folk artists have remained largely unknown, there were talented craftsmen in every village, and they created houses with characteristic features in different regions. Nowadays, these buildings are slowly falling into oblivion, so modern society has to give itself a clear answer to the question: how will we preserve our past? Together with the Craft Story studio, Ukraїner created a documentary series called Strikha (Thatching roof) about Ukrainian folk architecture, its regional peculiarities, and ways to save it.",
