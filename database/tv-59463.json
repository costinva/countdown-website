  "overview": "Twelve citizens are called for jury duty on a high-profile murder trial as traumatizing as it is controversial, in which a woman stands accused of killing her sister's child.As time goes by, the murder trial becomes a trial, not only for the accused, but for the jury members themselves.Behind the fa√ßade of their anonymity, these twelve ordinary people bring with them their own histories. Lives that are as complex as the trial, full of fractured dreams, shameful secrets, hope, fears, personal trauma and prejudice.",
