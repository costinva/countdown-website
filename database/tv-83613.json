  "overview": "I‘m Maleika, the famous Cheetah, and I would like to share with you the stories of my fellow friends in the African continent. Africa is a place of beauty, grace, joy and hidden danger. Of course, it‘s just me who narrates the stories, but my kids are keen to be seen as well :). I believe that you will appreciate how I see the different animals that live close to us, and the good and bad moments that all of us are going through in these tough times.",
