  "overview": "Murder, Lies and Alibis dissects some of the most infamous criminal cases from around the world. A team of highly experienced investigators re-examines cold cases police couldn't solve--discovering fresh leads, unearthing chilling footage and audio, as well as securing crucial interviews with witnesses going on the record for the very first time. Each episode is uniquely recounted through the eyes of the key players, such as victims, survivors, their families and friends, and in some cases, the persons of interest themselves.",
