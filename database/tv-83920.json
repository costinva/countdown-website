  "overview": "In Battle Camp, the greatest stars from across Netflix's broad slate of reality and doc-series return to face the ultimate physical and mental competition, where a giant spinning wheel randomly decides who stays and who goes. In order to keep your name off that wheel, our returning fan favorites need to be unbeatable in high octane challenges, unbreakable in grueling punishments and, last but certainly not least, unhateable in camp, as everyone has a vote. The player who achieves all three, becomes the ultimate Netflix reality competitor and takes home the $250,000 prize.",
