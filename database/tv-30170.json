  "overview": "Soul Quest Overdrive is an animated comedy series somewhat spun-off from an Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode. The show features H. Jon Benjamin, David Cross and Kristen Schaal reprising their roles as Mortimer, Bert and Tammy from the Bible Fruit episode, except in different forms (the pilot showed them as sporting equipment instead of fruit). A full series of at least 6 episodes was announced.",
