  "overview": "Homicide City dedicates its first season to crimes that shook Philadelphia to its core. The series explores cases from a darker time that had police detectives banding together across the metropolitan landscape in a sequence of manhunts. From the mansions and manicured lawns of the wealthy Mainline suburbs to the inner-city Badlands, each episode is told through the eyes of veteran homicide detectives, local beat reporters and the victims' families who lost so much.In each episode of Homicide City, Philadelphia's finest come out of retirement to tell the inside story about a headline-making case they'll \"never forget.\" Fortune and love do little to protect the fate of Philadelphia's victims as stories include the attack on Lockheed Corporation's wealthy CEO, Courtlandt S. Gross; the death of John Thurberg months before his wedding; and the killing of an expectant mother, Natise Johnson. Nonetheless, viewers will find a sense of justice in the commentary provided by former Montgomery County Chief Oscar Vance; retired Philadelphia Police Sergeant William Britt; Philadelphia Inquirer investigative journalist Larry Lewis; and other local experts.",
