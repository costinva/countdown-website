  "overview": "1964. Because he isn't making progress investigating a strange series of lethal fires, Inspector Gérald Boivin of the Montreal police is forced to take some time off. Overnight, he finds himself forced to do something he hasn't done for years: spend time with his family. On a suggestion from a stranger, Gérald takes his wife, three children, and his elderly father on a trip to Maine. But on their way out of Montreal, the Boivins convoy takes an unexpected detour: the whole family finds itself transported to the year 2010! Completely lost in a not-so-distant future, the Boivins dream of only one thing: to return home to 1964. To do this, they will have to find the man who, for mysterious reasons, planned their original trip. In doing so, they will have to question their beliefs, their values and their identity, all while trying to hold the family together and rebuild the fragile ties that once united them.",
