  "overview": "The four-episode drama follows the events that begin on December 31, 2021. The main character, Svyatoslav, makes a long-awaited proposal to Marina, but the joyful moment is interrupted by a call from his ex-wife asking her to come help her son. In the end, all troubles are resolved and the heroes meet the new year 2022 with the hope that it will be peaceful. Some of them believe in a full-scale invasion, some consider all talk of a great war to be hype, but in general, everyone lives their everyday life and wants to believe in the best, until they wake up to the explosions on February 24. Fleeing from rocket attacks, Sviatoslav, like many from Kyiv in the first days of the full-scale invasion, goes outside the city to his mother's house, where he gathers his pregnant bride, son, ex-wife and mother-in-law under one roof. The relationship between the women becomes more and more tense, and Svyat cannot make a final choice between the past and the future. In a few days, the town is under occupation, the Russians start shooting civilians. To save themselves, the heroes must find a common language and use their only chance for evacuation.",
