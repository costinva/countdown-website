  "overview": "The iconic game of Deal or No Deal is back and unlike anything you have ever seen before! This new format transports audiences to the Banker's private island where he makes the rules and there are twists behind every palm tree. Hidden on the island are over 100 cases with millions of dollars split between them, which teams must retrieve so that they can play a game of Deal or No Deal against the Banker. Only one team will survive until the very last episode, where they'll compete to beat the Banker for the biggest prize in Deal or No Deal history.",
