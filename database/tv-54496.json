  "overview": "It is 2012. In the past 25 years, our country has become very rich. And now we are in a crisis that affects us all. What happened? This question brought Jort Kelder and VPRO together. In Het snelle geld, Jort Kelder looks back as an expert witness and involved person on a quarter of a century of wild capitalist years in the Netherlands. In eight episodes, which offer numerous moments of recognition and amazement, Jort Kelder and protagonists shed light on the years 1987 to 2012, a period in which the Netherlands lost its shame for money and wealth and the crisis presented itself.Â ",
