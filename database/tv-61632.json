  "overview": "Lu Wanwan is a sophomore in the Clinical Department of Qingyao University School of Medicine. However, her poor psychological quality makes Lu Wanwan easy to perform abnormally during exams, and she is out of tune with the strict medical school. Due to the failure of secret love for many years, Lu Wanwan threatened to pursue Ren Chu, the super school leader of the same school, after drinking, and the scandal between the two came out. The uproaring scandal has seriously affected Lu Wanwan's already struggling study life. In order to separate the relationship between the two, Lu Wanwan managed to sign the 'Gossip Elimination Plan' with Ren Chu. In the process of clarifying the scandal, the two slowly saw the shining points in each other's characters, and gradually developed a good feeling for each other. With the help and guidance of Ren Chu, Lu Wanwan gradually overcame her inner timidity, found a balance between her interests and studies, and worked hard to become a qualified medical student. Ren Chu was also infected by Lu Wanwan and got rid of her studies. The tyrannical arrogance is becoming more and more friendly. Both of them were unconsciously changed by each other and became a better version of themselves, and finally gained a healthy and independent campus romance.Adapted from the novel \"Chu Ci Ai Ni, Wei Shi Bu Wan\" (初次爱你，为时不晚) by Zhun Ni Jia Qi (准拟佳期). ",
