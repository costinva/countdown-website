  "overview": "The task of the player and the presenter is to reconstruct the chronology of the day spent under hypnosis. The player is shown videos with his participation \"in another life\", but not to the end, then after each of them he is asked questions for 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 rubles with three answer options, which he must answer true, i.e. remember how the story shown in the video ended. After the participant has given an answer, they are shown the correct answer in the video. If the player answers incorrectly, he does not receive anything, but the money previously earned does not \"burn out.\" If the player is able to remember everything, he wins the maximum prize - 100,000 rubles.",
