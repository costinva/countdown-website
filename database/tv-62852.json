  "overview": "A Bangers &amp; Cash spin-off series that follows the journey of a vehicle purchased at a Mathewsons classic car auction, before being repaired, restored and then re-auctioned in order to try and find the vehicle a new home and loving owner.Â These genuine restoration projects, with varying degrees of difficulty, show how tricky it can really be to restore classic vehicles back to their former glory. Derek, Paul and Dave Mathewson are on hand to share their advice and observations on the variety of different jobs, which include an MG Montego Turbo with its engine in the boot, and a rare Lotus Elan S1 that hasn't seen a road for 47 years.",
