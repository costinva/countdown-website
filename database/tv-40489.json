  "overview": "Whoever said the apple doesn't fall far from the tree clearly never met Blark and his son. With Blark's fondness for hunting bears and his son's extreme love for video games, this father-son duo couldn't be more different. But that won't keep Blark from creating (and at times forcing) a strong paternal bond with his son.",
