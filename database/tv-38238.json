  "overview": "Sex may be everywhere in American media, but that doesn't mean American families are talking about it. While most teens could learn a thing or two from talking candidly with their parents about sex and most parents would benefit greatly from opening up about sex with their kids -- it's simply easier said than done. Much, much easier.",
