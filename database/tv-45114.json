  "overview": "Biography of billionaire tobacco heiress Doris Duke looks at her bizarre lifestyle, including her troubled childhood, her world traveling for audiences with mystics, a face lift at age 79, and her mysterious death in 1993 at age 80. But even upon her death, oddities continued as she left the affairs of her hotly contested estate to her hard-drinking butler, who had controlled much of her life and was accused by others of causing her death.",
