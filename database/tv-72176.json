  "overview": "The story focuses on a special unit of Czech intelligence, known as the Extraktoři (Extractors). The unit operates in secret and its main mission is to ensure the safe return of endangered Czechs from abroad. Extraktoři offers insight into the world of espionage and international covert operations. It provides a behind-the-scenes look at negotiations with terrorists, a topic that is often kept quiet by the world's governments, although they participate unofficially. Extraktoři are concerned with ensuring the safety of Czech citizens across borders, even at the cost of complex negotiations and solutions outside of traditional diplomatic channels.",
