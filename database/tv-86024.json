  "overview": "Florida's Apocalypse Manufacturing owner Joe Ghattas is a self-made boss in the custom truck industry, known for his bold designs and loyal following that includes hardcore enthusiasts, world-famous rappers, sports superstars, and elite supermodels. Alongside his wife and co-owner Ashley, he designs, fabricates, and sells these outrageous custom creations. No design is too wild for them to build – ranging from an Apocalypse Hellfire with a pull-out mobile kitchen for legendary chef Guy Fieri or an Apocalypse Super Truck with superhero branding for NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. With the support of his in-laws, who run sales and marketing for the business, Joe is on the brink of breaking through the fiercely competitive marketplace to establish an American auto brand in a category all its own.  From a high-water emergency response vehicle built for fire departments to traverse downed palm trees to a ‘Boat Truck' – an amphibious Jeep that cruises the highway and dives straight into the water Truck Dynasty showcases next-level creations built to conquer land, water, and everything in between. ",
