  "overview": "Meet the Gastineau Girls. No, they're not sisters. They're a mother-daughter duo of New York socialites who are best friends--and sometimes each other's biggest competition. Lisa, the mother, is a former model who made mad money in a divorce settlement with NFL star hubby Mark Gastineau (and invested rather well afterward, thank you very much). Brittny, the daughter, hasn't worked a day in her life. She lived with her grandmother after her parents' divorce and is now moving back to her mother's NYC pad after leaving college in Alabama. They're both looking for fame, fortune, happiness and true love--not really in that order. Good thing there's Luo the doorman-commentator to help guide us through the girls' adventures, because in the first episode alone, the mom and daughter pose for a naked photo shoot, have a surprise birthday party for Lisa and, oh yeah, shop a lot.",
