  "overview": "The story is set in the late 19th century and takes place at a time when slaves were freed in Brazil and there was a need for workers, especially on Brazilian coffee fazendas (plantations). This partly resulted in a large number of Italians emigrating to Brazil, looking for employment and a better life.Unlike many other telenovela stories, the characters are not larger than life in \"Terra Nostra.\" Instead, they are everyday people who make ordinary decisions. Consequently, the viewers can relate to what is happening in the story.",
