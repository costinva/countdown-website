  "overview": "Taylor and her group of friends are living what seems to be the perfect island life with sun-soaked beaches and jungle-like hinterlands. But underneath that perfect facade lies a hotbed of cryptic riddles, thrilling legends, and unexplainable mysteries waiting to be unravelled. Fuelled by her fascination with her Uncle Charlie's disappearance five years earlier, Taylor is the determined leader in pursuit of the truth. Alongside Taylor, there's Nori, a wisecracking rebel who's got an answer for everything; Meesha, a toughas-nails sports nut who's up for anything; Ellis, a hypochondriac who's the brains of the group; and Taylor's stepsister Lila, an aspiring vlogger who adores her older sister. With a determination to leave no stone unturned, the five best friends jump head first into a series of intriguing mysteries and nail-biting adventures through ancient caves, remote islands and eerie jungles.",
