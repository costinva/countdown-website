  "overview": "DI Jack Caffery is a young man searching for himself. Obsessed with the neighbour he believes murdered his 10 year-old brother in the 90s, Jack finds himself trying to right the wrongs of others - but at what cost? In an isolated house in Monmouthshire, the wealthy Anchor-Ferrers family find themselves the victims of a psychopath's cruel games, trapped and terrorised. When the two narratives collide, it's a thrilling, nail-biting and deeply disturbing race against time.",
