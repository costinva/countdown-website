  "overview": "A car accident killed a couple and caused their six children to become orphans. At that time, the eldest child, Tatsuya, was only 18 and had to attend a marathon training. Being unconfident of taking good care of his siblings, he separately relocated them to their relatives and adopters. However, after several years, Tatsuya gives up his atheletic career and decides to fetch back his brothers and sisters to live together. To his disappointment, everyone sees him as selfish and refuses to recognise him.",
