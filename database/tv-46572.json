  "overview": "Entre Hombres takes place in 1996, in the low funds of Buenos Aires, where there are no differences between saints and sinners. A banned party, a murder that must be silenced and a VHS cassette will be the elements that will unite a history full of blood and violence in a brutal, hopeless world.",
