  "overview": "Grace is a 30-something divorcee. But finding a mate isn't an easy task...and unlike the fairy tale, the prince often turns into a frog--not the other way around. This comedy series follows Grace as she juggles potential love interests with the support of her overprotective mother Hilda, her best friend Selma, and Selma's pre-teen daughter Tereza.",
