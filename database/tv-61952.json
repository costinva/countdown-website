  "overview": "A documentary project by Sergei Minaev about a decade in which we could do everything, and the sweet life seemed to never end. The historical anthology series will be a direct continuation of the \"Nineties\". The inhabitants of a country that is gradually recovering from long years of permissiveness are assimilated into a different market paradigm and, with incredible enthusiasm, begin to try on new models of production and consumption. Oil prices are prohibitively high, Isinbayeva sets records, Bilan wins Eurovision, and Kovalchuk scores a goal against Canadians in the final of the Ice Hockey World Championship. Episodes of the series will present different sections of the decade: Night Watch and The Last Hero, Dom-2 and Star Factory, the Centr group and the revolution in Russian rap, the madness of nightlife and economic euphoria. The key heroes of the era: Konstantin Ernst and Ksenia Sobchak, Dima Bilan and Alexei Kudrin, Konstantin Khabensky and Timur Bekmambetov will tell about how life was arranged in the 2000s.",
