  "overview": "One day, Mum, a playboy and the landlord of Room 609, saw a young man in his bed. Ever since the day they first met and slept, mysterious things have been happening. Mum kept dreaming about a mysterious event and would be suddenly woken up in the middle of the night by those strange dreams. Mum tried to forget his 'feelings' toward the young man by sleeping with women. However, it only made him think even more often of the man of his dreams. He then connected every detail and came up with the theory of reverse parallel universes. Eventually, he met Dew in real life. Although it was Dew's last day when they first met, it was also the beginning of them helping each other change the future!",
