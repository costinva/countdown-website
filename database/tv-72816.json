  "overview": "Set against the shadows of World War II, The Narrow Road to the Deep North tells the epic story of Lieutenant Dorrigo Evans, and how his all-too-brief love affair with Amy Mulvaney shaped his life. The story is told over multiple time periods, as we journey from Evans' childhood to his experience as a prisoner-of-war on the Thailand-Burma Railway as a young man, and later in life, as a respected surgeon and Australian war hero.Â ",
