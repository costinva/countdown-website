  "overview": "On March 20, 2013, four French nationals are arrested on board a private jet in the Punta Cana airport, Dominican Republic: two ex-air force pilots and two passengers about to take off for Saint-Tropez. On board: 700 kg of cocaine stored in 26 suitcases. None of them has the profile of an international drug smuggler and no one knows who the luggage belongs to. Who isn't telling the whole truth? Who's involved in the case? And what is hiding behind the mountain of drugs?Â ",
