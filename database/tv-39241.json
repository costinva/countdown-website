  "overview": "Each week, comedian Frank Nicotero hosts an interactive version of the classic board game, The Game of Life. In each episode, contestants compete to win cash and prizes. This live-action game show features two families who get to spin the wheel in a journey through a virtual world. Items from the original board game are featured in each episode, such as the iconic car and the rainbow-colored spinner, as well as the familiar roadblocks and obstacles. For the first time, the game is redesigned for television in a completely 3-D world.",
