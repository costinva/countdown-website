  "overview": "In Dying for Revenge, each episode of this true crime series recounts a shocking story of a crime committed as an act of revenge.From a worker humiliated by a colleague, to a woman facing ruin when an ex-partner sells their home, the trigger events are different but the consequences are the same: being wronged leads to murder. Illustrated with evocative drama reconstruction, location filming and archive footage, each story is told through interviews with family and friends, insights from detectives who solved each case, and analysis from expert criminologists.",
