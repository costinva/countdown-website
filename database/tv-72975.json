  "overview": "Best friends, Marcus and Lloyd, have just been evicted from their apartment and are struggling to keep their pest control business afloat. Then an old classmate introduces them to an ancient African statue that just might be the answer to their prayers. The tribe who created the relic believes it has the power to make dreams come true. Just not the kind of dreams our friends were hoping for.",
