  "overview": "Itadaki High JUMP, sometimes abbreviated as Itajump (いたジャン, Itajan), is the all-male idol group Hey! Say! JUMP's first regular one-man show. The show airs every Wednesday night on Fuji TV It initially appeared as a two-episodes special variety program that first aired on December 29, 2014, before being announced to be a regular show on June 11, 2015. The concept of the show is to solve \"serious problems\" requested by viewers to the members of Hey! Say! JUMP. In the show, the selected members come to a certain location without being told what they're going to do beforehand. In the studio, all the members watch a VTR of them solving the problem at the location.Besides regular 'problem solving' episodes, there are several segment series in the show: eat gigantic portion of food and guess its calorie in Haikaropa Dekamori (ハイカロパデカ盛り), helping children overcome their weakness without them realize, attempting to beat a champion or pro by violating the rules/cheating, solving several problems at the studio, proving whether a rumor is true or false in Mayutsuba (マユツバ), and deciding the show's next emcee by guessing which Johnnies talent is in the card in the game Koredore Donpishana (コレダレ・ドンピシャーナ). Some episodes are simply a recap episode.",
