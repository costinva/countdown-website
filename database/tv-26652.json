  "overview": "In each episode, Urban Legends brings to life three amazing tales, stories so incredible and far-fetched that we're not sure whether to believe them or not. Each story is presented as fact, pieced together from interviews and dramatic simulations. The catch is that some stories are true and some stories are false; the viewer must decide for themselves until the truth is revealed.",
