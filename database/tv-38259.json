  "overview": "Some families open a bakery shop, while others hit the seas for deep-water fishing. TLC's new series Hook, Line and Sisters follows the unusual lives of the Andersons, a family of fishermen who have only three months to brave the Alaskan wilds for a pay day. Hook, Line and Sisters is an inside look into a little explored territory - the wild, unpredictable and competitive world of deep-sea commercial fishing. Patriarch Dean Anderson is a grizzled sea dog known for his aggressive fishing as much as his salmon hauls. As captain of the Memry Anne, he squares off against rival fisherman, hungry sharks and his own hardworking family. His wife, Susan, spends as much time refereeing familial feuds as she does managing the family's finances.",
