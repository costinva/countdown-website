  "overview": "Twelve overweight individuals (eight couples in the revival) live together, cut-off from the outside world, as they are put through a strenuous exercise regime. During their stay, contestants must complete weekly tasks, cook all of their own meals, and stare temptation in the face as they are offered unhealthy treats. Each week, one person who has lost the least amount of weight (either individually or as part of a team) is eliminated, until only one contestant remains and is crowned, The Biggest Loser.",
