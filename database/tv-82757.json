  "overview": "Andrei Frolov, an employee of the criminal investigation Department, is a white crow. He does not like the work methods of his colleagues, he does not want to participate in interrogations that are conducted using violence and pressure. After Andrei has neutralized the criminal, who turned out to be the grandson of an influential person, he is given an ultimatum: he must leave the wanted list at his own request, or... Andrey is transferred to the precinct, and by someone's \"ill will\", he is entrusted with the most difficult criminal plan, a remote area called \"Molot\" (Red Hammer). This is a microdistrict on the outskirts of the Metropolis, a former workers' settlement named after the Red Molotoboits. The nearest metro station is 15 minutes away by minibus, which runs \"once a year as promised.\"A neighborhood with the typical charms of residential and working-class areas. It looks like the Wild West in some ways - it has its own laws, everyone is their own defender. In fact, the district is governed by an Authority (here the law is him). Life in the area is harsh, but for the most part, its inhabitants, despite their unpretentiousness and simplicity, turn out to be correct and real.",
