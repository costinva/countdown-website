  "overview": "The story is about Chinese students at the prestigious Ivy League college. The efforts they made to get accepted, when just being gifted students isn't enough; their experiences, struggles, relationships, and the blend of Chinese-Western cultures while studying there. Gu Nian planned to study abroad because she wanted to be with her foreign boyfriend for a long time. Without any experience in studying abroad, she enrolled in a studying abroad agency, LZ, on the net but had a dispute with the company's owner, Lin Yao, and her boyfriend, Zhuo Peng. The reason was that Lin Yao took Gu Nian's order even though the company was short of staff. Zhuo Peng, who was a legal entity but did not work in the company, was forced to become Gu Nian's temporary tutor and helped her become a university student. Shortly afterwards, Lin Yao and Zhuo Peng broke up. Zhuo Peng was hired as a psychological counselor at the University of A. He found that the international student community has some psychological, life, and academic problems due to the uncomfortable environment. That's why Zhuo Peng set up a free consultancy service to help students find the right school for them. This goal also coincided with Gu Nian's. In the end, they became partners and a couple.",
