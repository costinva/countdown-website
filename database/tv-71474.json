  "overview": "A century after the arrival of Pedro Álvares Cabral in Brazil, the bandeirantes from São Paulo went deep into the forests in search of treasures. The mountain that made access to new wealth difficult was called Muralha, the current Serra do Mar. On the outskirts of Vila de São Paulo, there was a farm, Lagoa Serena, where Dom Braz, a bandeirante leader, lived with his wife, Cândida, and the children.",
