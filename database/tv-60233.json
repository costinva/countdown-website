  "overview": "Hosted by iconic roasting queen and comedian Natasha Leggero and celebrity chef Ludo Lefebvre, Rat in the Kitchen is a game of high stakes cat and mouse where viewers get to play detective. A mix of professional chefs and passionate home cooks compete in a series of creative cooking challenges, earning cash in their bank for every dish that impresses Chef Ludo while attempting to expose an undercover mole (the rat) determined to sabotage the dishes and undermine their chances at victory. At the close of each episode, both cooks and viewers will determine who they think is the rat. If the cooks guess correctly, they win their bank, but if successfully duped, then the rat walks away with the cheddar.",
