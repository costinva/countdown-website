  "overview": "Centered on seismic events in the NBA in the spring of 2014, Blackballed tells a story of race, power and hubris through the eyes of the Los Angeles Clippers' players and coach. When a tape surfaced of then-team owner Donald Sterling spewing racial stereotypes, it set in motion events that changed the NBA—and sports—in ways that were once unthinkable. Now Clippers stars Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and JJ Redick, along with coach Doc Rivers and NBA commissioner Adam Silver, explain how over five days during the 2014 NBA playoffs they asserted their power, leading to the most unprecedented punishment in sports history.",
