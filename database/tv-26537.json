  "overview": "Bill and Barb Putman seem like they have an average American family. They have been married for 34 years, have four great kids and love to spend time with their grandchildren, but their still-growing family does things a little bit differently. This 25-person family lives under one roof, shares two bathrooms, pools all of their finances, and helps raise all of the kids as one family unit. Each episode will not only detail the little things that test this large household, but also highlight those extreme \"for better or worse\" moments they experience as both couples and a family.",
