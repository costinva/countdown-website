  "overview": "Uea and King, while working at the same company, have very different personalities; Uea takes relationships seriously and dislikes the flirtatious King. But fate plays its own games, and despite their differences they become friends with benefits. Even though they have an agreement and guidelines, their lust and desire for possession goes far beyond reason, driving them further and further into their passions with no way of pulling out. Who will be the first to put a stop to the game of lust and confusion? Or will the two of them break their own rules and fall in love?",
