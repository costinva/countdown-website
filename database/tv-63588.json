  "overview": "Fifteen-year-old Katrina (Kat) and her little brother Jamie have their world turned upside down when they are forced to go live with their mother, a veterinary scientist for a zoo in the big city, who they have not seen in years, and to whom the animals seem more important than they are. Then Kat develops a strange rapport with the resident Siberian tiger, Garang. Not only can Kat mind meld with Garang, but she develops enhanced night vision, smell and hearing. Jamie tries to figure out what is happening and solicits help from Jasmin, the youngest daughter of the zoo manager. A renowned geneticist, Dr. Lydia Raushark, develops an interest in Kat's relationship with Garang, but does she have ulterior motives?",
