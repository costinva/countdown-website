  "overview": "Advertising maven Monica Marks and her loyal right hand executive Doug Garcia have long been at the top of the Madison Avenue world. But after a record scratch blunder, they are suddenly canceled, pushed out and replaced by the agency's rising Gen Z employees led by social media manager, Kriska Thompson. Refusing to go quietly, Monica launches her biggest campaign yet â€“ getting their careers back and taking down the eager team of Gen-Zers who are just getting comfortable in their new roles. May the best generation win.",
