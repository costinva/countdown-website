  "overview": "Meen, a fifth-year medical student, cherishes a studious life filled with the joyful company of friends like Bon, Flint, Kim, Baikhao, and Pokpong. One day, Meen's mother sends Tul, the son of her close friend, who has recently passed the entrance exam to pursue engineering at Chiang Mai University, the top-ranked institution in the country, to live with Meen and assigns Meen to take care of Tul. Meen sees this as a good opportunity for him to move to a dorm near the university and have Tul take care of Nirand instead. But before moving out, Meen learns that behind Tul's excellence as a student lies a struggle with depression. Driven by his medical training and compassion, Meen makes the selfless choice to abandon the dormitory plan to support and care for Tul. As they live together for a while, their relationship develops beyond just \"brothers.\" Both must choose between a romantic relationship or ending it as mere \"brothers\" to fulfill their life goals.",
