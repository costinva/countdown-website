  "overview": "Pyry is a 16-year-old youth who dreams of getting out of his narrow-minded home to a visual art gallery in Helsinki. Pyry is artistically gifted, but progessing with his art is difficult because of Pyry's three-year-old little brother Otto, who is suffering from attention deficit disorder, and Pyry has an unreasonable amount of responsibility to look after him. Pyry is afraid of leaving and distressing his already stressed parents, if he is not there who will cover up Otto's messes?",
