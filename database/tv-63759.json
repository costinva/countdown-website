  "overview": "Every week, interior designers, hypnologists, SMM managers, astrologers and even policemen will become guests of the program. Their task is to create a trendy look that will make the jury believe that they are professional stylists. A team of judges, consisting of designers and fashion bloggers, will have to determine which of the participants are pros and who are amateurs. But the main goal of the show is not to reveal the deceivers, but to prove that anyone can actually be a stylist.",
