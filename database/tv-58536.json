  "overview": "The radical social experiment Hunted will take viewers on an intense, edge-of-the-seat journey where ordinary Australians go on the run, attempting to avoid a crack team of expert hunters. The stakes will be huge in this real-life thriller as we follow Australian fugitives, all facing the daunting challenge of remaining undetected. The fugitives will not be allowed any money to assist them and are unable to enlist the help of others during their desperate flight. To evade their pursuers, they'll need to become invisible. But when every move you make can leave a trace, hiding in plain sight will be far from simple. The team of experts giving chase will consist of some of the world's top investigators, each of them with access to cutting edge, targeted technology. If our ordinary Australians can outsmart and outrun the pros, they stand to win an incredible prize.",
