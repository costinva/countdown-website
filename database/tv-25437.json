  "overview": "The War of 1853-1856 is most often known as The Crimean War. But the battle for the Crimea was only one episode of a much bigger war. The confrontation between the Russian Empire on the one hand and the Allied Forces of the British Empire, France, Turkey and the Kingdom of Sardinia on the other affected a huge territory stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. In fact, it was a war for world domination - in effect a world war.What were the overt and covert reasons that caused the confrontation between the great powers in the middle of the XIX century? How it all started and what role the Russian Empire ultimately played on the world political stage is all told in this challenging and insightful new four-part documentary series, WORLD WAR 0.",
