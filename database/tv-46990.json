  "overview": "Deadwax is a mindbending neo-noir set in the obsessive world of vinyl collecting. Etta Pryce, a vinyl tracker, is hired by a rich collector to hunt a legendary rare record that has driven its owners mad and killed anyone that has dared to play it. The more she learns about how impossibly dangerous, and real, this record may actually be, the more seduced she becomes by the temptation of hearing it herself - no matter what the cost.",
