  "overview": "Confident home cooks think they are arriving for an audition - but get the surprise of their lives when they find out they are actually heading into a head-to-head competition against a world-class chef. These home cooks excel in their own kitchen - but do they have what it takes to succeed against an elite pro under the lights and cameras of a culinary battle? After a star-ingredient themed cooking round, the fun continues as Eddie hits the streets to find a panel of six regular folks to blindly taste the dishes. To even the playing field, the home chef has to receive only one vote to win a $5,000 prize. Star chefs competing against the home cooks are Eric Adjepong, Anne Burrell, Maneet Chauhan, Scott Conant, Tiffani Faison, Amanda Freitag, Alex Guarnaschelli, Antonia Lofaso, Marc Murphy and Geoffrey Zakarian.Â ",
