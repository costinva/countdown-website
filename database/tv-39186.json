  "overview": "Breaking up is hard to do for any couple but for Hollywood's biggest stars there is more at stake than just a broken heart. The end of a relationship for celebrities can mean huge scandals, vicious custody battles, libelous accusations that can tarnish a career and financial ruin. Irreconcilable Differences covers the contentious splits between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, Bruce Jenner and Kris Kardashian, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, Hulk and Linda Hogan, Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Madonna and Sean Penn, Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Roseanne and Tom Arnold. With insightful commentary from legal, relationship, crisis management and entertainment experts, each hour-long episode chronicles the affairs, abuse and addictions that poisoned the headline-grabbing marriages and will uncover every step of each ugly uncoupling as family, friends and fans are forced to take sides.",
