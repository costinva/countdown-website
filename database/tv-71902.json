  "overview": "Mateusz, the father of 12-year-old Max, is a scientist, physicist - participating in the expedition of a team of archaeologists conducting excavations in the Andes. Max, who goes beyond mediocrity with his knowledge, is not liked by his schoolmates, especially since he is a new student in the class. His only friend is Matilda, as crazy as Max, nicknamed the 'Wild'. Mateusz finds a mysterious object in the Andes - a solar spear, emitting unusual, as it will turn out, extraterrestrial radiation.Â ",
