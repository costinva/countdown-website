  "overview": "The Nantes Homicide Department has saddled itself with a team of high-powered experts who are aces in solving murders yet cannot carry on a normal conversation. Criminologist Julien Tardieu has a brilliant mind and a few--dozen?--neurological disorders. This Sherlock needs two Watsons: Inspectors Lise Doum√®re is the volcanic, explosive one and Dan Levasseur is the quiet behind-the-scenes operator.",
