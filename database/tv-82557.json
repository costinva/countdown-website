  "overview": "Studio producer \"WeiT Media\". Originally filmed for the Russian TV channel \"ДТВ\" in 2010, but was not shown on air.When traditional investigation methods reach a dead end, professionals can look for any, at first glance, fantastic clues and even turn to psychics for help. To believe or not to believe them? This question arises in each episode, during the investigation of each dramatic case - until non-standard methods help to unravel the most complex crime. Each episode of the series \"Psychics - Detectives\" is the story of one difficult criminal offense, which is investigated in parallel by an investigator and a psychic. Psychics do not immediately see the full picture of what happened, but they provide the investigation with information obtained through visions, contact with the personal belongings of the victim, working with photographs. Receiving additional and much-needed information, the investigator can expand the circle of suspects, find additional evidence and solve the crime.",
