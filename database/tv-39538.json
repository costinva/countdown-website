  "overview": "TLC announced plans to premiere new pageant series King of the Crown, taking viewers behind the glam, beyond the hair spray and into the unseen world of pageants. The show revolves around veteran pageant expert Cy Frakes, who has been coaching aspiring beauty queens for over 20 years. The world of pageants is estimated to be over a billion dollar a year business and continues to be of intrigue to many Americans. TLC goes inside the world of competitive beauty pageants with Cy's pageant training business, Gowns and Crowns, as his team helps clients perfect everything from their walk, to their talk, to their hair, down to the dress. The premiere episode features the now infamous Caitlin Upton, the former Miss Teen USA South Carolina who could not give a coherent answer during the question portion of the competition. She became a YouTube sensation, generating over 35 million views. In the premiere, Cy takes on the challenge of preparing the most parodied teen queen for a comeback to the pageant stage. He wants to not only redeem Caitlin's image, but also prove his business can deliver pageant-perfect women.",
