  "overview": "Tetyana Krutko, a well-known practicing psychologist with many years of experience, is a new teacher at the Institute of Psychology. She announces recruitment for the practical psychology course. To get to her course is the dream of many students. As a real pro, she likes to solve difficult problems, break stereotypes and teach on cases from real practice. The task of the course is to teach the basics of practical, effective psychology, because this is the first step to solving any life problems. Each lecture of the course is devoted to one specific topic: from the usual - why a personal life does not work out, to the realities dictated by how to survive a loss. The listeners are a group of students. The main thesis of the course: if I'm so smart, why don't I live as I would like?",
