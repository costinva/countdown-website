  "overview": "The Glo Friends are a community of small, glow-in-the-dark bugs that live in Glo Land, a magical kingdom located in the middle of a forest. Their homes are built near the Glo Pond, from where they harvest a substance known as Moondrops. It is Moondrops that sustain the Glo Friends and enable their ability to glow in the dark.The Glo Friends peaceful existence is threatened constantly by the Moligans, a group of mole-like creatures led by Starnose. The Moligans were banished from the kingdom of Moleslavia by King Mole for various crimes including unlawful digging, mob action, robbery, looting and cheating. Since their banishment, the Moligans have been living underground and planning revenge against King Mole. Since the Moligans are short-sighted, they were unsuccessful in harvesting gold from the nearby mines. As such, the Moligans have attempted to enslave the Glo Friends to power their lanterns, which would enable them to see in the mines, harvest the gold and buy out the kingdom of Moleslavia.",
