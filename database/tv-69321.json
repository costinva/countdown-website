  "overview": "Ari Shemer was the greatest singer Israel knew in the 1970's, and a legend in his own lifetime. Decades later, Lenny Shemer, his grandson, turns out to be a musical prodigy and signs up for a famous reality-TV singing competition that may turn him into a pop sensation. So why is his father, Kobi, Ari's son, so underappreciated by his peers? How is it that the great talent seems to have skipped over him with such cruel nonchalance? This is a musical drama about the strange nature of talent, three generations of musicians and the echoes left between them.",
