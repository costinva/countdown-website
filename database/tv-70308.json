  "overview": "The commander of the SOBR, Major Dmitry Chistyakov, loses consciousness while performing the next task. The consequences of a traumatic brain injury received in a \"hot spot\" are making themselves felt. The medical board recognizes him unfit for further service.Chistyakov cannot imagine himself as a security guard or the head of a warehouse and turns to his old comrade, lieutenant colonel ugro, with a request to arrange him for the police. No one needs a \"fit\" man there. But Chistyakov has a gift: during seizures, he can see other people's memories, you just need to find a thing that was dear to the owner. This information helps Chistyakov to restore the picture of the crime and more than compensates for the lack of experience in the investigation.",
