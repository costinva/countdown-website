  "overview": "Welcome to The Shetland Islands – an archipelago of wonders, unlike anywhere else in the world. In this series we come ashore in this magical world, where seabirds outnumber people by a factor of many hundreds and where you're closer to the Arctic Circle than you are to London. We meet native Shetlanders who live according to centuries' old traditions, feeding themselves at the ‘croft' farms that have fed the locals for many centuries, or the fishing fleets that have wrenched precious sustenance from the ever-powerful sea.They're independent up here. They have to be…We also meet the ‘incomers' who arrived in Shetland for the promise of a simpler life, and who fell in love with the place – from seasonal chefs who catch their own menu items, to shanty-singing choirmasters. It's a world where community spirit, resilience, independence and tradition are much-valued commodities.And that's to say nothing of the beauty of the landscape – from stunning beaches to rugged cliff faces and sweeping landscapes. Join us on this celebratory journey, uncovering the magic that defines Shetland and the compelling stories that make it a truly exceptional destination.",
