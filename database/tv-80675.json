  "overview": "When An was only eleven, he and his parents were in an accident that took their lives but spared An. He was then adopted by Gu Hao Wei, a CEO and friend of his parents. An was then living under the same roof as his crush Jin. Sometime after An and Jin overheard an argument over An inheriting the company, Jin began to ignore him and chose to go to school in America. Sure he knew the reason, An felt guilty. Years later, Jin returns and attends the same university as An. Still at odds and fighting all the time, Jin's jealousy drives him to use force with An, who he's long been in love with. Knowing the truth—that his father had been responsible for An's childhood accident—Jin has avoided facing him.",
