  "overview": "The Graveyard Carz crew - Mark, Daren, Josh and Royal - take wrecked muscle cars and restore them to assembly-line condition. Led by Mark \"The Warmachine\" Worman, the crew works some serious magic to get these Mopar racing classics across the finish line every week. As a leading Chrysler muscle car specialist and body shop owner, Worman doesn't settle for anything less than perfect restorations. Neither does his team as there is too much beauty in a quality Detroit automobile to let them go to rust. Even if it is a Herculean effort, these cars will rise again.",
