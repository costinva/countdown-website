  "overview": "One day, in a quiet Meshchersk near Moscow, events occur that dramatically change the lives of seven friends-classmates who have just graduated from school, as well as their older relatives. On a dark suburban highway, the guys hit a pedestrian with a car, who mysteriously disappears from the scene of the accident. The car belongs to a well-known person in the city - a successful businessman nicknamed the Cossack, and his nephew, the Cossack, drove it. The incident can get loud publicity and serious consequences: the Cossack has just concluded a lucrative deal with foreign investors, who will certainly refuse to cooperate if they find out that their new partner is involved in crime.",
