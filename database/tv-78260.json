  "overview": "At the start of each episode, the network gives Â£250,000 to the studio audience and all they need to do to keep it...is remain silent. With every audience member mic'ed up, all hell breaks loose as a green room of 30 acts, led by three returning comedian captains, headed up by Katherine Ryan, wage war on the audience, with every sound forced out of them bringing the total prize money down. It's entertainers vs audience - they're not on the same side. If the entertainers get the prize pot to zero, they get to give money to charity. Silence is Golden - the comedy show that you can't laugh at.",
