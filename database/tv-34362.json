  "overview": "Nix Festes is about a three-man-and-a-woman shared flat in an old Berlin building. The four not only share the bathroom, kitchen and favorite pub, but sometimes also the bed - and are prime examples of the 'Generation Unable to Relationship'. Although the WG quartet finds a loyal adviser in the caf√© owner Lennart, the relationship tips of the slowly aging man are unfortunately not exactly dewy.",
