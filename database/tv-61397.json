  "overview": "Follows the footsteps of the two comic heroes and breathes new life into their adventures. A unique opportunity to meet or rediscover Tintin and their creator Hergé. Each film follows the plot of a comic book album: each episode retells the story of a specific album at the respective original locations. The documentaries follow the reporter Tintin and his dog Struppi to the countries they traveled to in the comic. Drawings from the albums are embedded in real film sequences and bring Tim and his friends to life. In addition to the elaborately designed album scenes, \"Travelling with Tintin\" uses archive images and selected expert interviews to show how Hergé processes historical events of his time in comics. Sources of inspiration for Hergé are cultures from all continents, major political events and also his own life. This is how the world of Tintin came into being, with which two generations have now grown up.",
