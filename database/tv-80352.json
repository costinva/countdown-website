  "overview": "As a rough guy, the idiosyncratic Tjark Wolf investigates in the rough landscape of East Frisia. At his side is the police chief Femke Folkmer, with whom he - of course - forms an unequal investigator duo. They make a grisly discovery on the North Sea coast - and little do they know that this will begin their collaboration in a series of murder cases that will push them to their limits - or even beyond.",
