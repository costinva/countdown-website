  "overview": "Part meditative tutorial, part fireside chat, each episode of Painting with John finds the artist ensconced at his worktable, where he hones his intricate watercolor techniques and shares his reflections on what he's learned about life. Combining images of Lurie's paintings, original music, and irreverent point of view on tapping into your childlike artist side, his overall ambivalence toward fame, and more, the series reminds us to prioritize a little time every day for creativity, fun and a bit of mischief.",
