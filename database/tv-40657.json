  "overview": "Hundreds of miles deep in the New Mexico desert is one of the country's most prestigious testing facilities. Over the last 50 years, the men and women of The Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center have engineered and tested weapons and explosives for the world's largest defense contractors. But they're about to face their toughest challenge yet: the elaborate contrivances and contraptions of a cartoon. Watch as a team of the nation's brightest minds takes on the devices and techniques used by Wile E. Coyote in his vain attempts to snare his arch-enemy the Road Runner. See if expertise, years of training and the best equipment that money can buy will be enough to actually make Coyote's flawed Acme Company machines work.",
