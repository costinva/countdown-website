  "overview": "In 1983, a mythical band of assailants known as Os Bons Malandros wages a spectacular assault on the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum. The goal is to get your hands on the famous Lalique jewelry. In Lisbon in the 1980s, in a city with almost 1 million inhabitants, with the IMF in Portugal, Eriksson at Benfica and Futre at Sporting, Armando Gama at the Cancão Festival and O Tal Canal, on RTP, we immerse ourselves in the unusual history of seven charismatic assailants that have captivated thousands of readers over the years. An adaptation of Mário Zambujal's book.",
