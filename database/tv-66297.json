  "overview": "The participants of the program will be amateur musicians who dream of a big stage, but are so far known only in narrow Internet circles. The authors of the show will help them turn their songs into a real \"candy\". Each song will get a new breath thanks to the stars who will perform them in a new arrangement right in the studio. Five nuggets and five stars will take part in each issue: experts will evaluate their performances, and the audience in the hall will choose the winner, who will receive a cash prize.",
