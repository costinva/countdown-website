  "overview": "Four little dinos and one BIG Gigantosaurus… learn to dare! Rocky, Bill, Tiny, and Mazu are four young dinosaurs growing up in the Cretaceous period. Life is always an adventure: new volcanoes are popping up all the time, long-necked brachiosauruses and enormous triceratopses roam free, meteor showers light up the night sky and… the big bad Gigantosaurus reigns over it all!The mere mention of Gigantosaurus's name is enough to stir a range of conflicting emotions in the four young dinos: fear (Bill), fascination (Rocky), laughter (Tiny), and scientific interest (Mazu). Through the adventures of the young dino heroes, Gigantosaurus reflects the different ways 4-6-year-old children discover the world… and themselves.",
