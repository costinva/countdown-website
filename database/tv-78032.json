  "overview": "The deputy commissioner Vanina Guarrasi, after a brilliant career in the anti-mafia, left Palermo in an attempt to escape the past and the bond with the two men she loved most: her policeman father and her ex-boyfriend Paolo Malfitano, a magistrate operating in the anti-mafia. The crazy fear of reliving certain traumas has taken over: and so here is Vanina in Catania, in the new role in the Homicide Section, supported by the esteem of a new team of policemen. And by the affection of her friends.",
