  "overview": "Documentary following life in a home for orphaned chimpanzees run by wildlife vet Jimmy Desmond and his wife Jenny. The Desmonds started with just two rescued baby chimps, saved from the illegal pet trade, but now their home is bursting at the seams with 21 orphans to look after. Their dream is to build them all a new sanctuary in the forest and, with help from friend and chimp specialist Ben Garrod, they teach the orphans the skills they would have learnt from their mothers in the wild.",
