  "overview": "Pablo has it all—a quiet life, a close-knit community and a son he adores. As the coach of a youth Canarian wrestling team, he's known for his kindness and calm demeanor in the peaceful town of Arcadia. No one knows the truth about Pablo's dark, dangerous past. Once living on the edge in Mexico, he escaped his violent life to protect his son Bruno. Becoming a father changed everything for him—but running away from his old life came at a cost. His wife, who he left behind, has never forgiven him. Now she's back, ready to shatter the world he's built. As old secrets resurface and tension boils, Pablo is forced to confront his past. Can he protect his son and hold onto the paradise he created, or will his former life destroy everything he loves?",
