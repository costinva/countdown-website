  "overview": "Fusing documentary and drama, Dublin Narcos tells the story of how drugs changed the fabric of Dublin, which can still be seen to this day. This ground-breaking series hears first-hand from an extraordinary cast of characters, swept up in the burgeoning new business of drugs – from the kingpins to the Gardaí who struggled to find new ways to bring down the new breed of criminal; from local mums who fought battles with dealers, to cocaine couriers and club owners; and from ravers who rode the wave of drug fuelled euphoria, to users whose forays into dealing led to their own downfall. Crucially, the series also hears from the fearless journalists whose attempts to expose the drug barons eventually lead to the death of one of their bravest, Veronica Guerin.",
