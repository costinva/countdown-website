  "overview": "Brigi and Brúnó appeared on the screens just 20 years ago and became the favorites of TV viewers with their good-for-nothing relationship stories. The ferocious duo is now back, but how much have they changed over the years? Do they still put each other in an uncomfortable situation in front of the couples therapist? How do they get along with the mother-in-law? In the episodes of the situational comedy, fans of the couple in love can also meet brand new and reimagining of familiar stories, directed by Gábor Herendi and Gergely Ipacs.",
