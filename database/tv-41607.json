  "overview": "Life After Lock-Up is a documentary series offering unprecedented insight into the issues that underpin re-offending rates in the UK. The series is filmed over a one-year period tracking how ex-offenders deal with life on the outside after being incarcerated and living within the routines that institutional life supports.By following a diverse group of eight ex-offenders, the series draws on themes of mental health, addiction, social mobility, employment and education and with government under pressure to reduce re-offending rates, the series offers a timely look at the pressures ex-offenders face, unearthing the real stories behind the statistics.",
