  "overview": "They are famous... Singers, comedians, comedians... Their life is comfortable and urban. For the first time in their lives, they will live a completely new and particularly difficult experience: for a week, a famous artist will experience the unusual and uncomfortable daily life of the greatest explorer in the world, Mike Horn. They will face the hostility of nature with the minimum necessary to survive: a knife, some ropes, a little water and nothing else: only nature will provide them with what they will need! Whether in the ancestral desert of Namibia or in the suffocating jungles of Sri Lanka, Mike Horn will serve as their guide in these wild and hostile territories... In the heart of nature and returned to the wild state, these personalities will lose all their bearings. During this experience, the artist will discover a whole new way of life, be confronted with the intensity and beauty of nature, causing him to question himself.",
