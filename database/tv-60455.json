  "overview": "Custom bike builder, Titch Cormack and his team take on a range of mechanical challenges, converting broken and battered vehicles into beautiful, bespoke machines - ready for daring adventures on wheels.Titch left a 10-year career in UK Special Forces (Special Boat Service) where he specialised in vehicle mobility, to follow his dream, designing, building, and selling custom vintage motorcycles and cars. In 2016 he converted a derelict former shellfish processing plant on the waterfront in Poole into his vintage workshop, using reclaimed and upcycled materials to create what he describes as a \"souped-up man-cave\", where he now builds his unique creations.Titch is joined by his team: mechanic Billy, an ex-Tank Regiment Commander, who suffered life-changing injuries following an IED explosion in Afghanistan, and John, an ex-Staff Sgt from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers - and all-round 'guru of engineering'.",
