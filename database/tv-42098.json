  "overview": "Everything is bigger in Texas, including Sheriff J.B. Smith's personality. A veteran detective of Smith County, Texas, he knows what it's like to encounter larger-than-life crimes, and he knows he needs the best of the best at his side to solve them. Smith and his handpicked team of detectives, Pamela Dunklin and Joe Rasco, are here to show that when it comes to Smith County, Texas, if you're going to do the crime, you will do the time. Each member of this crime-fighting trio has skills designed to perfectly complement each other: Dunklin leads with her intuition and is not afraid to get down deep into the details; Rasco is the thinker and the feeler of the group, using his analytical mind and empathy to get the core of the crime; and, with Sheriff J.B. Smith as the fearless leader of the unit, Dunklin and Rasco are empowered to tap into the skillsets that put them on the force. In the Lone Star Justice, this group recounts their most memorable cases, proving once and for all that in the state of Texas, no one is above the law of the land.",
