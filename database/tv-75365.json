  "overview": "Secret Weapons of World War II explores the desperate weapons race fought by nations worldwide to gain an advantage over their adversaries. Incendiary bats, flying wings, rubber tanks, and guns that shoot around corners – in wartime, there is no such thing as a bad idea, but not all of these ideas worked or even made it beyond the planning stage. This riveting series tells the story of the weapons that changed history, and still impact our daily lives. Like the small top-secret device invented to improve radar, the magnetron – now found in most kitchens as a microwave. Learn about the inventions born out of desperation that resulted in jet engines, rockets, lasers, and computers. Beyond the apparent silliness of pigeon bombs and death rays, this fascinating series highlights innovative weaponry developed during the war and the resulting transformative technological revolution.",
