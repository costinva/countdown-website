  "overview": "Manfred Gilow emigrated from Germany to Texas years ago and works as a police chief in the town of Hawkins. The settlement has changed a lot over the years. Where oil wells once brought prosperity to the inhabitants, there are now all the more criminal cases. Many livelihoods are on the brink of collapse, which is why thefts and domestic violence have been on the rise for years. The German-American Gilow is on the side of the law and has his hands full enforcing it here.",
