  "overview": "Devon thinks her sister Simone has a really creepy relationship with her new boss, the enigmatic socialite Michaela Kell. Michaela's cult-ish life of luxury is like a drug to Simone, and Devon has decided it's time for an intervention, but she has no idea what a formidable opponent Michaela will be. Told over the course of one explosive weekend at The Kells' lavish beach estate, Sirens is an incisive, sexy, and darkly funny exploration of women, power, and class.",
