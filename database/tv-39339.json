  "overview": "Set amongst the vibrant international community of the eponymous Spanish island, The Mallorca Files centres around the clash of personalities between a British and German detective who have very different approaches to policing. Yet despite - or perhaps because of -their very different approaches, the sleuths form a perfect complementary partnership as they seek to solve a new crime on the island each week.",
