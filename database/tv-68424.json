  "overview": "Multiple Emmy nominee Anthony Anderson owes his Mama Doris a lot, as she gave up her own dreams of being an actress to raise him. As a token of his appreciation, he is treating her to the trip of lifetime - a six-week excursion through England, France and Italy - to discover some of Europe's wonders for her first time and experience a real, cultural vacation filled with history and luxury. Whether it's walking in African fashion week, hunting for truffle or taking elaborate cooking classes, spending this amount of quality time together will be a real test for their relationship as the pair disagree on most anything and everything.",
