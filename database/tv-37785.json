  "overview": "Sea Trek is five fantastic voyages to the most exotic and dramatic underwater locations in the world from the team responsible for Reefwatch and Supersense. Specially developed 'bubble helmets' enable the presenters Martha Holmes and Mike DeGruy, both marine biologists, to talk under water when they come face-to-face with the magnificent, unusual and sometimes dangerous creatures of the deep.",
