  "overview": "Frog is a frog. Toad is a toad. They have a lot in common â€¦ but they are also very different. Frog and Toad are best friends who know that the true secret to friendship is not only enjoying the things you have in common, but embracing the things that make you different. Our differences are what makes us special, and Frog and Toad celebrate them in what makes them unique.",
