  "overview": "Andrew Denton will make his long-awaited return to Seven in a show based mostly on chairs. Australia's shortest (some would say greatest) interviewer will sit opposite a range of fascinating people and try to find out what makes them tick. The formula will be simple. Two people, two chairs, one conversation, no gimmicks. Even its title will be simple. Interview. The only complex bit will be the people Andrew talks to â€“ every possible kind of human being and a few impossible ones as well. Topical when it needs to be, timeless whenever it can, Interview aims to be about light, not heat. In a time when everything seems to be splitting apart, Interview will seek out what binds us. There will be talking. There will be listening. There will be laughing, and hopefully the occasional, compelling silence. And if that doesn't work, there'll be a bathroom renovation. Possibly some blindfolded dating. And as a last resort, some kind of mystery food challenge (Surprise! It's an eggplant!). Interview. Every week, amazing humans.",
