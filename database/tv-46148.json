  "overview": "Just after the Liberation, in the months after the tragedy of the extermination camps, the few survivors return to their home. Among these the boys and girls who have seen and lived the horror and who will not find family waiting for them. This story is about them and some courageous adults who help these children to return slowly to life, within an institution, impromptu, and without resources. Here, in Italy, these children and young people will discover mutual respect, solidarity, the desire to play, to study, to work, to love, and to tell the story of their lost humanity. To do so, they will have to go through difficult trials and defeat their inner monsters.",
