  "overview": "Holiday Showdown matches up two very different families with completely opposing ideas of what makes a good holiday and sends them away together for two weeks. The rules are non-negotiable, for each week of the holiday one of the families is in charge in their ideal holiday location. Both families have a challenge - to convince the other of the wonders of their holiday. Holiday Showdown guarantees stress and conflict aplenty but also surprising insights discovering what happens when one family's idea of holiday heaven is someone else's holiday hell.",
