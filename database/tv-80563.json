  "overview": "Narrated by Tom Hardy, this thrilling three-part series will examine three deadly and successful missions conducted by British special forces units in different parts of the world.Throughout the series, the focus is on the men of the British Special Forces who were in the front lines of these operations. We speak to the soldiers on the ground, hearing their first-hand testimonies of what went down over the few tense days and hours of the mission. It is their story, told through a series of intimate interviews, accompanied by action packed drama recon and fascinating archive footage and stills.High-end drama reconstruction will be an integral element of this series and will help to bring these amazing stories to life. This is full throttle, intense, cinematic and Hollywood style drama but with no scripted dialogue – we will let Tom Hardy and the interviewees do the talking.",
