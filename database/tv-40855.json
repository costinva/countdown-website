  "overview": "Hold onto your cocktails because here we go again! Reunited: The Real World Las Vegas is bringing us back to Sin City to see what happens when the cast of The Real World: Las Vegas reconvenes to live together once again. The tables are turned as all of the original roommates head back to their old stomping grounds, the suite at The Palms Casino Resort. Will they be able to put the past behind them and start anew? No longer seven strangers, Real Worlders Trishelle, Steven, Brynn, Irulan, Frank, Alton and Arissa have some serious history together. Even after The Real World: Las Vegas ended in 2002, they kept in touch while battling it out on such Real World/Road Rules Challenge shows as The Inferno, Battle of the Sexes and The Gauntlet. But their relationships are sure to change when they are reunited at The Palms five years after they first met. New friendships will bloom and old feelings will surface. And there will definitely be drama. Loads and loads of drama. But are there hot tub hookups, heartbreaks and catfights in store or has the cast moved past all that nonsense? All bets are off because absolutely anything can happen when these former Real World roommates are thrown together again!",
