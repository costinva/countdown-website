  "overview": "The HISTORY Channel's new series The American Presidency with Bill Clinton, is hosted and executive produced by President Bill Clinton and explores the history of the American presidency and the struggle for a more perfect union across six themed episodes: race, extremism, the struggle for rights, presidential vision, global power. This premium series features expert commentary from renowned authors, historians and witnesses to history including Pulitzer Prize-winners Jon Meacham and Annette Gordon Reed, as well as Dr. Douglas Brinkley, Dr. Edna Medford Green, Dr. H.W. Brands and George Takei. Across each one-hour episode, it takes a comprehensive look at a wide variety of presidential action that moved our country forward, like President Eisenhower ordering the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock, AR to ensure the safety of the \"Little Rock Nine,\" President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and Emancipation Proclamation, and Lyndon B. Johnson signing into law what has been called the most important piece of Civil Rights legislation to date: the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \"The American Presidency\" also tackles presidential decisions that further divided our country, like Herbert Hoover's \"repatriation drives\" that led to the mass expulsions of Mexican-American citizens during the Great Depression and FDR's Executive Order 9066 leading to nearly 120,000 Japanese-Americans being systematically rounded up and forced into prison camps.",
