  "overview": "When carb-loving comedian Tom Papa isn't doing stand-up, he is probably eating, thinking about or making bread (his specialty is sourdough), and he takes his passion for baked goods to the next level in the new Food Network series Baked. In his mission to find the country's best breads and pastries, Tom hits cities from coast to coast to shine a light on how local bakeries make life a little sweeter.",
