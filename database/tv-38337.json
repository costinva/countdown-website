  "overview": "With a combination of investigative reporting and absurdism, anarchic polemist Blindboy from The Rubber Bandits leaves Limerick to unpack the housing crisis. From dodgy landlords to the multinationals, he seeks to expose the stark reality of being a millennial simply looking for a place to call home. He explores how it is possible for some landlords to prey on the vulnerable to developers who manipulate the system, how it is possible for money launderers to invest their money in swanky Mayfair property, to the Government policy that gave birth to Generation Rent. With a unique mixture of irreverent commentary, absurdism, secret filming and a band of undercover reporters, Blindboy seeks to expose the socially corrupt practices that exist in the dark and shady world of property.",
