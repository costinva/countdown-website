  "overview": "In March 2012, video game legend Tim Schafer made history with the Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter, a crowdfunding campaign that changed the way games are created and funded forever.For three years, a documentary crew captured the once-secretive process of video game development, chronicling the creation of \"Broken Age\" from a Kickstarter pitch to a finished game and beyond. Along the way, Schafer and his team at Double Fine persevered through production delays, internal strife, financial crises, looming deadlines, sickness, layoffs, and the weighty expectations of a critical public.",
