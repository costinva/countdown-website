  "overview": "Alive explores disasters that grabbed global headlines for weeks, months, and even years. This show tells the story from the perspective of several separate survivors who had the smarts and the raw human instinct to survive. Each subject tells their complete story of survival, from the peaceful moments beforehand to their triumphant rescue. The stories are deeply personal and emotional accounts of an adventure, sometimes only a few hours in length, that changed their lives in the aftermath.",
