  "overview": "A cruel tyrant or a seer on the throne? I call the drama about the most mysterious Russian emperor Paul a tyrant and even a madman, but his character and history are much deeper than the mask that his descendants have unfairly given him. The alienation of his mother's murder, the rejection of the court and the endless attempts to analyze who and why his father really was, formed a deeply tragic personality. Having become emperor after many years of waiting, Paul sought to get rid of the permissiveness of the nobility and improve the lives of serfs and ordinary soldiers. How will he be able to realize his plans and retain power?",
