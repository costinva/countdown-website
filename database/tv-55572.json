  "overview": "Twenty young, hip, and hungry chefs bring their cutting-edge culinary skills and fierce determination to Chopped Next Gen. With youth comes unflappable confidence, as four chefs compete in each hour-long episode through three rounds to bring a youthful spin on dishes never seen or tasted before. A recurring panel of some of the culinary world's up-and-coming stars - Nyesha Arrington, Darnell Ferguson, Mei Lin, Esdras Ochoa and Kwame Onwuachi - judge each competitor's dish based on taste, presentation and how creative their vision is. Only one chef walks away each episode with the cash prize and bragging rights in adding Chopped Next Gen champion to their growing resume.Â ",
