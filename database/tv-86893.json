  "overview": "Alina, a young beauty blogger, Zhenya, a teenage pranker, Vika, an excellent student, and Kolya, a 6-year-old True Edge fan who is always asking questions, are the Akimovs' four children. Like any kids their age, they dream of being alone at home, without the supervision of their dad and mom. But when their parents get stuck in Kamchatka because of a cloud of volcanic ash, the dream becomes a reality, and the apartment is gradually overgrown with pizza boxes and dirty dishes. How long will the joy of complete freedom last? Will children be able to cope with \"adult\" tasks — communicate with neighbors, defeat the flu epidemic, assemble furniture and (most importantly) return the missing Internet? And most importantly, will they miss their parents?",
