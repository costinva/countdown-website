  "overview": "I'd like you to think about it for a moment.If Beethoven's parents didn't meet, he, much less his famous fifth symphony \"Destiny,\" would have never existed.If the parents of Edison, Einstein, or Bill Gates didn't fall in love, what would the world today be like?Yes, in reality, there is certainly that special someone you must absolutely fall in love with--the person of your destiny.A strange man who claims to be \"god\" suddenly reveals himself to 29-year-old lead character Makoto Masaki and declares, \"You haven't realized it yet, but only a wall separates you from the one you must fall in love with, no matter what. The woman you're destined to be with works in the office next door.\"\"Sounds like something out of a creepy dream. But..,\" wonders Makoto. Skeptical at first, he eventually decides to believe the prediction and just go for it.\"Please don't be shocked. I'm your destiny,\" he tells fellow 29-year-old Haruko Kogetsu.\"What?\" she replies, before flat-out rejecting him. And that's where their love story begins.Whether it's the beach they went to as children, their college entrance exam building, or the shrine where they offered prayers last New Year's, it's a miracle how the two have actually crossed paths countless times since they were little. Yet they don't know each other's name nor recognize each other's face. The greatest \"destiny\" story kicks off on the worst possible note.",
