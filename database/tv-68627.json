  "overview": "Set in 1990, Boots is about Cameron, a bullied, gay high school student who joins the Marine Corps with his straight best friend, Ray - a dangerous move when being gay in the military meant jail time or worse. As these two friends plunge into Marine Corps boot camp, where the landmines are both literal and metaphorical, they join a platoon of young men on a harrowing journey of transformation.",
