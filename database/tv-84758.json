  "overview": "Mama na prenájom is a touching and suspenseful story in which the paths of two families cross thanks to chance and a little girl's wish to get to know her mother... Martin Toman, a successful gynaecologist and co-owner of a prestigious obstetric clinic, raises a kindergarten girl, Hana, alone with her father Ed. Her mother left them so long ago that Hanka doesn't remember her at all. However, Martin has unwisely promised Hanka that her mother will come for her sixth birthday, and now she has no idea how he will fulfill his promise. She finds unexpected salvation in the unbridled and somewhat crazy Nadi Vernerova, who runs the family restaurant with her father Dušan and siblings Beata and Juraj. Hana and Nadia are united by the fact that Nadia's mother has long been absent from the Verners' lives. The meeting of Nadia and Martin triggers a sequence of unexpected twists and events that will eventually intertwine the two families, flushing out dark secrets of the past while giving Hanka hope that one day she will indeed find her dream mother.",
