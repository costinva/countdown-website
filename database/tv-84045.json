  "overview": "This story follows the sweet and \"overprotective\" newly-wed life between Someya Yukito, a young master of an established inn in Asakusa, and Tsuruoka Io, a pure-hearted female apprentice training to be a chef. Tsuruoka was in the depths of despair until she found solace in the sweet konpeito candy given to her by Someya. Since then, she has earnestly cherished her feelings while training as a chef. Yukito's affectionate words and actions reserved only Tsuruoka, along with his excessively cute jealousy, create an irresistibly heart-fluttering devotion with a charming gap that's impossible to resist!",
