  "overview": "Grá ar an Trá is back for a second series with ten new singletons hoping to discover a love for the Irish language and each other. Bean and Man an tí, Síomha Ní Ruairc and James Kavanagh, have thrown open the doors of their ‘Love Teach' once again and if our new daltaí (students) think they have it all figured out, they're in for some surprises. This year, contestants can secretly vote for other couples they don't think are making enough of an effort to teach and learn. This new twist will see the couples who aren't pulling up their socks face the Cinnire Grá, Grainne Seoige, who ultimately decides who stays and who goes. There'll be even more fireworks, fun, focail and of course grá in this Gaeltacht for grown-ups as our couples compete to be crowned 'Couple with the most focail', walking away with €10,000!",
