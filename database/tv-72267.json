  "overview": "Iconic stories from the age of Noir, (1930's–1950's), from the ‘Lonely Hearts Killers' to ‘Murder Incorporated', delivered in the cynical, pitiless hard-boiled voice of the great crime novelists of the era – Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Jim Thompson, James M Cain and Patricia Highsmith… and with the visual flair and blackly comic drama of the Cohen Brothers.Our uniquely restored colour footage sets the epic stage. Stabilised, frame rate corrected, it is sharpened in a way that turns grainy super 8 and 16 mil into a crisply detailed 4K window on the real mean streets of New York more than seventy years ago.The dialogue and scenes will be lifted and adapted straight from contemporary police and court statements, testimony and newspaper accounts. Real stories, real drama performed by real actors.All interspersed with other ‘evidence' screened for us by our publisher /photographer/writer in his ‘office' – (there is no shortage of contemporary newsreel of these infamous crimes- we'll intercut restored B+W archive and Weegee style photographs with our colour archive and drama).",
