  "overview": "Leha, a former police sniper with post-traumatic stress disorder, learns about his sister Katya's terminal illness in the midst of an alcoholic binge. Katya does not want her daughter to be sent to an orphanage after her death, and asks Lech to take hold of her head so that he becomes the guardian of an eight-year-old girl. Lech has already lost many close people in his life, so he does everything to help his sister: he gathers old connections and gets a job at the police station. The area turns out to be difficult. The criminals that Lech must catch are fairy—tale characters: Serpent Gorynych, Baba Yaga and other evil spirits. And if the former sniper has no problems catching villains, then trying to become a good guardian becomes a real test for Lehi.",
