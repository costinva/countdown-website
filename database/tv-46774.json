  "overview": "The already familiar group of young friends has unusual abilities! However, they are a little specific and instead of helping (after all, you could stop time, rise in the air, spit fire), pretty much spoil the measured life. Andrii «Hliuk», Oksana «Mala», Valiera «Lyzun», Katia «Kipish» i Tetiana Hermanivna «Madam» are new heroes whose abilities cause sincere laughter. Together, they will continue to harness their talents and save the world again! Well, at least they'll try.",
