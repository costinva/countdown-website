  "overview": "In a bustling district, a House of Wonders variety store has opened, where items, seemingly ordinary, each possess peculiar functions. The owner, Damon, has documented the instructions for use in the Wonders Notebook, allowing customers to select items based on their needs. People from all walks of life flock to the House of Wonders, each facing their own dilemmas and seeking ways to overcome them. However, in the end, they invariably discover that what truly resolves their issues isn't these strange and curious goods, but rather their own love and faith.",
