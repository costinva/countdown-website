  "overview": "BBC Two and BBC Current Affairs announce Laura Kuenssberg: State of Chaos which explores the reasons behind some of the most dramatic and chaotic political events seen in a generation. Laura asks if our politics has been stretched to breaking point and if it can ever be normal again, in a series of three one hour episodes produced by October Films.From the Brexit referendum, resignations, elections, prorogation and the pandemic, Laura was the BBC's political editor and held a ringside seat as these events unfolded. She'll investigate why this period became so toxic, both in public and behind the scenes, and add her own reflections on the period.Beginning with the referendum result and culminating in the downfall of Liz Truss, the documentary will feature candid and revealing interviews with cabinet ministers and senior officials who were in the room as some of the most momentous decisions in British politics were made. It will also exclusively hear from senior civil servants and Number 10 staffers who have never spoken publicly before.",
