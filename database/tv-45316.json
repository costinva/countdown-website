  "overview": "Police profiler Arnar is out of his depth when he is ordered against his will to travel from Copenhagen to Reykjavik to help investigate Iceland's first serial killer case--a gruesome series of murders where elderly men have been abused and butchered in a horrific manner. Arriving in Iceland, Arnar is quickly paired up with senior inspector Kata, who isn't happy with his involvement as she is the lead detective on the case and now feels demoted by his arrival.",
