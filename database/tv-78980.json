  "overview": "A young prince, astonishingly charming and unforgivably sexy with not a hint of shyness, was not expecting cupid to strike when he meets the prodigy girl who helms the leading startup of luxury homestays in India. Two worlds, one of a dwindling aristocracy, and the other of racing capitalism converge and throw up a whirlwind of clashing ambitions, steamy romance, chic couture and fashion-forward Instagrammable moments. This is a breezy zoomer romcom served up with a side of dreamy palace life, under the blazing royal sun.",
