  "overview": "Yulia Loginova is a dentist and aspiring detective writer. She recently published her first novel, which received a lot of positive feedback from readers. Fans are waiting for a new book, but there is a nuance. Loginova's boyfriend, Investigative Committee investigator Denis Potapov, believes that the first book was written thanks to his stories and advice, and wants to get his share of the pie and be a co-author of the book. Because of this, Denis and Yulia quarrel, and Yulia is left without a source of inspiration for new detective stories. Soon Julia becomes an unwitting witness to the murder. She has the opportunity to directly participate in the investigation.",
