  "overview": "Nine days after discovering Earth, Galactica and the fleet are back in space. Lt. Felix Gaeta is on board a Raptor with two Cylon number Eights and three other humans en-route to the Zephyr when a DRADIS contact prompts the fleet to execute an emergency jump. A computer error results in the Raptor jumping to an unknown location beyond the Red Line. Stranded without a functioning FTL drive, those on board face the grim realization that they may run out of oxygen before they are rescued.",
