  "overview": "Three complete strangers, Mishiba Toki, Nakajyo Nobuto and Saitoh Kazuo, are hired by a corporation to compete an illegal dog-fight conducted in strict secrecy called the Bus Game. The trio, who form a group named \"Team AAA\" (Triple Anonymous) must work together whilst still keeping anonymity, mistrust and not prying into each other's privacy. Their work and living environments, and their personalities are all different, but the one thing they do have in common is that each of them need a large amount of money for their individual circumstances. To get the money, they must play in the game despite their very own lives being at stake.",
