  "overview": "Adapted from the quiz show that aired from 2010 – 2012, and inspired by the audience calls for its return. Hosted by comedian and Triple J presenter Michael Hing, Celebrity Letters &amp; Numbers will see the return of wordsmith David Astle and numbers expert Lily Serna. Each episode features three comedic celebrities and a special guest alongside David in Dictionary Corner. They will battle it out for the highly sought after, priceless, antique collectible of… one single book, from a vintage 1980s encyclopedia collection, generously gifted by Michael Hing's parents after they cleaned out their garage. Series guests include Hamish Blake, Matt Okine, Merrick Watts, Jennifer Wong, Aaron Chen and Susie Youssef, to name a few.",
