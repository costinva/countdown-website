  "overview": "Dance Brothers centres around the two brothers Roni and Sakari, as they struggle to make a living as professional dancers. To help finance their dance dreams they decide to start their own club, which provides income, housing and a training space. Their unique club and impressive dance routines quickly bring them fame. Soon artistic ambitions and personal relationships collide with commercial demands, it's business versus passion. The loyalty and love the brothers have for each other will be tested by the one thing that always united them - dance.",
