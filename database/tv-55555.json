  "overview": "It is in a laundromat or on a football field that Hortense, an atypical art history teacher, explains some of the \"masterpieces\" of classical European painting and reveals their erotic power. The \"great masters\" had better watch out because here we touch everything, everyday life becomes a living museum and the past is embodied in the bodies of today.",
