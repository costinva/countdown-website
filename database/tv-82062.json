  "overview": "Colin and Justin's Sub-Zero Reno puts Colin and Justin in completely new renovation territory. Having purchased a dilapidated cabin on a picturesque blue lake — beautiful in summer, but harsh in the cold months - the couple have their work cut out for them. They must transform an ugly duckling property (and former storage facility for their many projects) into their dream home amidst the unforgiving Canadian winter, where temperatures plummet to minus 40 degrees Celsius. The series showcases the relentless pursuit of perfection as the designers face numerous obstacles, including blizzards, dangerous roads, and a rapidly ticking clock. From fraught deliveries and icy conditions to the custom designs required for the new space, every step of the renovation is pressure-filled. But the two are no stranger to adversity and are determined to overcome delays, unpredictable weather and their own demanding personalities.",
