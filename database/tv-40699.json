  "overview": "The quiet life of Ani and her brother Yegor came to an end when one morning a hail of destructive shells fell from the sky. The world as we knew it no longer exists. Heroes fall into a cruel cycle of struggle for shelter, food and fuel. But the roof over his head and soft bed ceased to be the limit of dreams, because now the survivors have to fight a new threat that has come not from this world.",
