  "overview": "February 1934.  Navigating the Northern Sea Route in one navigation was an ambitious goal and was of great importance for the USSR.  Many considered this venture to be a futile and risky undertaking.  Young and daring polar explorers, led by Otto Schmidt, sincerely believed that on the Chelyuskin steamship they would be able to complete their task.  But great ideas turned into a great tragedy - the ship was trapped in ice and sank.  Now, in the harsh Arctic conditions, the \"Chelyuskinites\" have to fight for their lives every minute.",
