  "overview": "At the turn of the century, a comet crossed the Spanish sky, shattering the laws of fame and success and dissolving the line between the popular and the underground. For a few years, the front pages and prime time were taken over by celebrities from another dimension. Creatures who, until then, seemed condemned to ridicule and contempt, who caught our attention without adapting to any kind of normality. A magical story with room for esoteric conspiracies, eternal nights, quantum bricks, multicolored supervillains and an improbability made star: Tamara.",
