  "overview": "In March 2020, a French teenager is last seen walking into a remote coastal village in New Zealand before disappearing without a trace. He isn't the first to vanish like this. Since 1992 six people have gone missing in and around Piha, a small and otherwise idyllic settlement. Nobody has ever been found. No case has been solved. The most logical explanation put forward by the police is that they all disappeared at sea, but not everyone is buying this story. Could a far more sinister cause of these disappearances lie within this isolated community? Could one of Piha's own be covering up a terrible accident, foul play - or even murder?",
