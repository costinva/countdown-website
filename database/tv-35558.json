  "overview": "Five British boys who have failed their core GCSEs are given a second chance at a school like no other. Inspired by studies which suggest white working class boys do better academically in ethnically mixed classrooms, the boys take part in a study programme at the world famous Doon School in India. One of the best schools in the world, with an exam pass rate of 100%, British head teacher Matthew Raggett believes he can transform the boys' prospects in just six months, preparing them to re-sit their exams. The boys will have to shake off their old habits if they wish to survive the rigorous standards at Doon. Will they knuckle down?",
