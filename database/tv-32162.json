  "overview": "Colonial House is PBS's answer to reality television. Over the course of five months, \"settlers\" are forced to adapt to life as it was in the year 1628, on a desolate stretch of coastal Maine. As the group strains to establish a working colony with only the equipment and knowledge of the time period, viewers get a glimpse at life as the Pilgrims experienced it. It's like a living slice of history!",
