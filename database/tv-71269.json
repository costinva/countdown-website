  "overview": "With an IQ of 242, Antonia Scott is officially the smartest person on Earth. Her intelligence made her the \"Red Queen\" of a secret and experimental police project, but what seemed like a gift became a curse, and she ended up losing everything. When the son of a powerful tycoon is found gruesomely murdered and the daughter of Spain's wealthiest man is kidnapped, the Red Queen organization is set in motion. Mentor, Antonia's former boss, turns to Jon Guti√©rrez, a hot-tempered Basque cop on the verge of being expelled from the force, to reactivate Antonia. The twisted cat-and-mouse game in which Jon and Antonia become entangled in during the investigation helps them discover that they admire and complement each other almost as much as they irritate each other. Reina Roja is a haunting thriller set in Madrid, a city that plays a central role to the story, that combines the urgency and action of the investigation with the juicy and witty chemistry between its two main characters.",
