  "overview": "The three TEXAS METAL'S LOUD AND LIFTED garages work on everything from oversized mud stompers to supercharged street racers, and each have their own areas of expertise for building a new generation of jaw-dropping monster machines. At the helm of Wide Open Garage is Dave and Daniel Donnan, a father and son team, and Robert Brown, who focus on MegaTrucks and mud trucks, while the Mod Mafia garage with Josh George and Mark Pyles specializes in rock-crawling Hummers and other all-terrain vehicles, the 1 Way Diesel Performance garage with brothers Chase, Clay, and Tommy Wells build everything from low riding Mac trucks to diesel pro-mod race cars.Â ",
