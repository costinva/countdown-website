  "overview": "The women of the Ivanov family have an amazing gift — each with her own. Darina sees through people, her mother Tamara Petrovna knows how to brew potions, and the viewer has yet to learn the gift of her teenage daughter Katya. And only Darina's husband, Valera, a school physics teacher, remains faithful to science. Soon word of mouth spreads rumors about the magic family, and the Ivanovs begin to help others in solving their everyday problems. But will their abilities help to sort out their own family stories?.",
