  "overview": "Survivor is the British reality game show based on the popular international reality franchise of the same name.The show follows the same general format as the other editions of the show. The players are split between two \"tribes\", are taken to a remote island and are forced to live off the land with meager supplies for an extended period of time. Frequent physical and mental challenges are used to pit the teams against each other for rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their players.Once about half the players are remaining, the remaining players are merged into a single tribe, and competitions are on an individual basis; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out. Most players that are voted out at this stage form the \"Tribal Council Jury\". Once down to two people, a final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the Jury as to why they should win the game. The jury then votes for which player should be considered the \"Ultimate Survivor\" and be awarded the grand prize of Â£1,000,000.",
