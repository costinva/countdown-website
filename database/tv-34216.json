  "overview": "Homicide investigations aren't over when the suspect is in custody. It's then that the next phase begins with a high-stakes game of cat and mouse between the prime suspect and the prosecutor tasked with putting them behind bars. Pressure is high to solve the case, and few know that feeling better than Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi, who spent 21 years as a prosecutor with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, where she held a 35-0 success record in the Homicide Bureau. The six-episode series follows Nicolazzi as she travels across the country to reveal how the nation's top prosecutors tackled their toughest cases, taking viewers inside the fight for justice for victims and their loved ones.",
