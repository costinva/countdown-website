  "overview": "Specialty car restoration mistakes are much more common than you'd think, and each episode of Last Chance Garage features a car with a horrifying backstory: multiple shops, years lost, and tens of thousands of dollars in sunk costs. On the flip side of that struggle, audiences will see the customer and learn about their unique - and often deeply personal - connection to their car.Â ",
