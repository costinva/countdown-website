  "overview": "The demand for domestic staff in the UK is higher than ever, with one in four households now hiring home help. This series ventures behind the gates of Britain's stately homes, deep inside the world of those with the money to spend, to see how the cream of society handles the staff - from the testing interviews, to the candidates desperate to get their foot in the door, down to those all-important employment decisions - whether the salary is £90 a week or over £100,000 a year.",
