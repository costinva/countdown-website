  "overview": "The plot of the miniseries takes place in Prague at the turn of the 1970s and 1980s, when Prague did not have a very friendly impression at first glance: Gray crowds in front of half-empty shops, houses decorated with peeling posters commemorating famous anniversaries. Her night street is gripped by a completely new, terrifying phenomenon - young sexual rapists with sadistic tendencies. Elite criminal Jiří Markovič sets out on the trail of these very criminals.The miniseries not only follows the process of the investigation and capture of Ladislav Hojer, but above all offers an insight into the specific relationship between Hojer and Markovic. In each volume, he also provides insight into other closed cases that shaped Markovič's career as an elite investigator and illustrate the development of his method.",
