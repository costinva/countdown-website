  "overview": "Linda, a 50-year-old working class married mother of two, is having an existential crisis. Who is she? What is she? Is this it? Convinced she's got early onset dementia after forgetting what a shoe is called, Linda's GP informs her it is, in fact, the menopause. Feeling invigorated and empowered by this information, Linda decides to claw back some of the time she's spent doing ‘invisible work' over the years (not all 3.5 million minutes, just 131,500 of them) to do something for herself… for a change.  ",
