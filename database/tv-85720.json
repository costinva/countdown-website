  "overview": "From deciding what's for dinner to planning family outings (and maybe ven a cheeky splurge), 10 new teens are about to find out what it really takes to run the show. Emma Watkins is back to cheer them on, offer advice and provide the occasional reality check. The teens are not just managing the household budget; they're also saving for their own ambitious goals – from a state-of-the-art drone, to funding a home recording studio or buying their first car. With Emma's guidance they'll face real-life financial challenges teaching both themselves and their parents about money management and independence.",
