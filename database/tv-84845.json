  "overview": "Naši presents the life of a family of five with occasional slightly ironic undertones, so natural for normal relationships between children and parents. Every week, a father and mother struggling to raise their three sons invite us into their daily routine and offer us a tasty cocktail of varied emotions, laughter and screams. Every parent can easily identify with their stories and situations full of humour, but also tenderness and heart-warming human warmth. They provoke us to laugh, smile or think, and the occasional gnashing of teeth cannot be ruled out. Our heroes undoubtedly succeed in dramatically changing the optics through which we view the contemporary family, while sending a reassuring signal to us all that we parents - or our children - are not alone in this. ",
