  "overview": "De bachelorette is about romance, rivalry and, quite possibly, true love! Belgium's most eligible bachelorette, Elke Clijsters, is in search of the man of her dreams and hopefully her groom-to-be in this hit reality series. Our bachelorette is ready to find love and will embark on a romantic journey as she meets 20 handsome bachelors, all vying to win her heart. The guys compete for the bachelorette's affection via individual and group dates involving local and far-flung romantic encounters and adventures. As the bachelorette narrows the field and the number of men dwindles, romance and tensions will rise. At the end of her romantic voyage, if she has found Mr. Right, will there be a proposal â€” and from whom?",
