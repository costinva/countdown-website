  "overview": "Remember your first day at your new job? Now imagine being a police officer. Rookies, shot on location in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana and Tampa, Florida, puts viewers in the squad car as each rookie heads out on patrol for the first time. Each week viewers will join the journey as rookies learn how to patrol the tough city streets with their field training officer (FTO). These veteran cops teach the rookies how to survive. Some of these rookies will have what it takes - and others will be asking themselves if they can take the heat in one of the toughest jobs in America.",
