  "overview": "After a police raid turns into a bloodbath, the corpses of pontifical Swiss guards are found in a basement. As evidence is being discretely disposed of, a night watchman sets the world on the path to hell. Four spectral horsemen start leaving a trail of terror and destruction in their wake. The horsemen of the apocalypse metaphor is a way for the creators to invite the audience to think about the necessity of a paradigm shift. In this story, the media, such as the radio and television, never speak of ghost-like monsters but focus instead on insane politicians and almighty bankers â€“ in other words, demons of the collective imagination for the modern world.",
