  "overview": "A thrilling drone's eye view of history. This series of short documentaries offers a dynamic perspective on British history through hard-to-access places and untold stories. Agile drones bring us to historic locations we would not normally be able to visit, and enable us to see them from angles and heights we'd never be able to experience otherwise.As well as the historical information, the films are intended to be a visceral viewing experience in which the sheer pleasure of flying through narrow spaces and into apertures is at the core. The distinctive, entertaining narration is delivered by the popular British comedian Paul Chowdhry, who mixes a fascination for history with an irreverent, surreal sense of humour. Each episode features a different, contrasting location, and the programmes range across historic periods and themes, from the Mediaeval to the Victorian, from the dissolution of the monasteries to the boom in the railways.",
