  "overview": "Finders Keepers is the story of keen detectorist Martin and his wheeler dealer soon to be son-in-law Ashley who, while on a boys bonding trip in the idyllic fields of rural Somerset, discover a hoard of buried Saxon treasure worth millions.Legally, they should declare it, but Ashley spots an opportunity to look after number one, and as pressures are building at home with his wife Anne, straight arrow Martin can't help but have his head turned. It's tempting. If they sell it on the black market, they could be set for life and Ashley has the connections to make it happen. But with a hoard this good, could it really be that easy? After all, they might not be the only ones out for its spoils.Â ",
