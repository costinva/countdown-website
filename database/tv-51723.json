  "overview": "Ciao, Italia! Lorraine Bracco, the Oscar and Emmy-nominated actress from Goodfellas and The Sopranos, will take a break from Hollywood for her next gig on the island of Sicily—renovating a 200-year-old home she purchased for only one euro. The new HGTV series will follow Lorraine's journey to renovate the 1,075-square-foot property in the tiny hilltop town of Sambuca di Sicilia with help from an architect, contractor and other local experts. The Sambuca one-euro program was created by the mayor to help sell the town's vacant homes quickly and inexpensively. The goal is to encourage families to return to the rural oasis, but the catch is that the homes must be completed within three years of purchase. While it was a bargain at its one-euro price point, the centuries-old home has no electricity, running water, kitchen or bathrooms and needs to be gutted due to it's deteriorating floors, crumbling walls and dilapidated roof. The whole-home renovation will be a massive project filled with unexpected challenges, tough decisions, disappointments, valuable learnings and triumphant reveals. With her contractor Piero, translator Cynthia, several American friends and a welcoming town on her side, the impossible will become a breathtaking reality when together they complete a gorgeous Italian retreat where Lorraine can spend time with her family. ",
