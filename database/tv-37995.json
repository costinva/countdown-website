And while family businesses have moved wealth and the value of hard work from one generation to the next, many fear that millennials of today don't have the kind of work ethic that will take their family business through this century.Chris Parvin, a family estate planner, has seen it all. So he's headed out across this nation to help see if the kids of today have what it takes to take over the family business tomorrow. With money, promotions, and stakes in the company on the line, this is no game. Chris will help these business owners put their children to the test and see if they have what it takes to earn their family's Blood Money.",
