  "overview": "T.O. is be shadowed in the off-season by his best friends and publicists Monique Jackson and Kita Williams as they battle the two sides of his large personality. Mo and Kita want to help Terrell match all the success he's had on the field with that same kind of success off the field. Now, after a string of relationships and off-the-field endeavors, Terrell re-examines his personal life and finally put a plan into action. These outspoken, vibrant women are more like T.O.'s sisters than people who work for him. They function as matchmakers and therapists and also put their marketing expertise to use and help him make his life off of the field as successful as his life on it.",
