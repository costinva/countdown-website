  "overview": "Baroness Karren Brady meets a host of brave people who've decide to go it alone and start a new business. Karren meets the owners of each venture at the start of their first year. Then, in an instant, it'll be 12 months later and she'll discover what can happen when you Give It a Year.Through her travels across the UK Karren meets a range of entrepreneurs who all believe they've got the next big thing. Some ideas are weird and wacky others are literally out of this world. She'll want to know as much about their hopes and dreams as she does about the sales figures. This business show is as much about the people and their personalities as it is the profit and loss sheet.",
