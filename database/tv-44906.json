  "overview": "How did the world we call home come to be? It's a question that is as old as humankind itself. Now, space technology is helping us gain new insights into the formation of our solar system and how the dynamic life on our planet has influenced the rise of our species. Combining the latest scientific discoveries and theories with CGI, we journey through eons of fire and ice to detail how Earth evolved into a habitable planet and how humanity's success is putting us and our environment in peril.Â ",
