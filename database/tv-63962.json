  "overview": "Ever wonder if intelligent life existed elsewhere in the Universe? If higher intelligent beings from other worlds do exist? Are they here on Earth? If so, then why? Why don't they make themselves more public? Why the secrecy?In this series Reuben Langdon interviews actual ETs or EDs (Extra Dimensionals) as they call themselves. Each episode focuses on one particular race or \"Collective\" of Beings and/or an actual being who channels through a particular person or persons. The goal for this series is to receive answers to questions that people have been asking since nearly the beginning of time. Let's find out the big picture perspective of who we are, why we are here, and where we are going.",
