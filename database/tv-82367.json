  "overview": "Filthy Fortunes spotlights Matt Paxton and his team as they complete the most squalid and hazardous jobs to help everyday Americans cash in. Before the treasure hunt can begin, Matt will assess the property to determine potential costs associated with the clean-out and estimate the value of items hidden inside the hoard. With each property, he wagers that he'll discover enough to cover all the costs and make a profit. Matt takes all the risk, and if all goes according to plan, it's a win-win situation for both him and the client.  ",
