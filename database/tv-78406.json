  "overview": "Ayumu Miyamoto is a young orthopedic surgeon. He goes back to his hometown in Nagano Prefecture and begins to work at the general hospital there. In addition to working as an orthopedic surgeon, he is ordered to join the mountain medical treatment team. The team provides treatment for patients who became sick or injured while in the mountains. The medical team members need to have knowledge about both the mountain and medicine. They are called mountain doctors because of this. Ayumu Miyamoto is not passionate about his duties on the mountain medical team. Things change as he works more with the team members. Meanwhile, Gakuto Emori is a circulatory physician who works at the same hospital and is a member of the medical treatment team. Although Gakuto Emori does his job well, he has trauma from his past that he tries to overcome.",
