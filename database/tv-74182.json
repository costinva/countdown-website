  "overview": "What is The Inside Man?The Inside Man series started out as a challenge: ‘is it possible to create a drama about information security that rivals anything seen on Netflix?'The result was The Inside Man, Season 1, a twelve episode storyline, featuring Mark, a relatable anti-hero hacker who has been tasked by a sinister ‘controller' to infiltrate a company and help bring it down. Like all the best-loved TV dramas, the key to success was a binge-worthy, gripping storyline with a cast of funny, heroic, resourceful, colorful and skilled characters, whose exploits just had to be reprised for a second and third season. The rest, as they say, is history. The Inside Man ‘family' have now reunited for a fifth season that sees them taking on cyber threats in far-flung parts of the globe. All the adventure, drama and action show no signs of slowing anytime soon. Join us!",
