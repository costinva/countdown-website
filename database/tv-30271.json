  "overview": "Last Chance Driving School is a half-hour docu-series that follows Sven and his crew as they take on the disoriented, despondent and downright dangerous students that all other schools have taken pains to avoid. Every close-ended episode follows two students as they journey from terrified novice to qualified driver. Sven Ruppaner and his team of driving instructors have just a short while to turn their flustered pupils into safe and sensible drivers, with newfound confidence to take on the unpredictable and accident-prone streets of New York.",
