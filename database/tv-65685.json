  "overview": "The beautiful city of Baton Rouge was paralyzed by fear for nearly a decade as 36 women were murdered in erratic and unpredictable ways throughout the city. As serial killers walked free, the horrific murders created confusion and inconsistencies with no pattern or matching victimology. With thousands of false leads and dozens of false suspects, police struggled to profile and pinpoint a killer behind the spree of vicious attacks. Police followed dead end after dead end, but after a terrifying interrogation with a serial killer, combined with uncovered evidence, it was finally revealed that there was not only one serial killer, but multiple unrelated, overlapping murderers stalking the bayou throughout the same period.",
