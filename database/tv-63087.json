  "overview": "Kashiwazaki Yu has been dating her boyfriend Naoki for 7 years, and they have been living together for 5 of them. Romance has long gone out of the relationship and even Yu Naoki's birthday is more interested in his new game than her holiday. And Naoki doesn't seem to be thinking about the wedding at all. An angry Yu leaves the house and immediately meets her ex-boyfriend from Fukami High School. Yu finds himself in a love triangle. What will the girl choose â€” the current guy who treats her more like a mother, or the former, who still has tender feelings for her and considers her special?",
