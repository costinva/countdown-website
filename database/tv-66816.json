  "overview": "Andy returns for a brand-new series of adventures around the world, visiting all seven continents and getting closer than ever to an amazing new cast of wildlife that inhabits our planet. Andy and Jen travel the globe in their hi-tech, eco-friendly expedition truck, the Explorer - a scientific research station which houses Jen's database, a digital archive filled with incredible facts about the fauna and flora with which we share our planet. Information collected on each mission is uploaded to the database, informing, educating and inspiring people about the natural world and what they can do to help protect it. As comprehensive as it is, the database isn't complete.In each episode, our intrepid team are set a mission by HQ to solve one of nature's mysteries, whether that's seeking out new animal discoveries, never-before-seen behaviour, uncharted habitats or solving unexplained phenomena. Only when they discover the right information and upload it to the database, via the onboard AI, Scout, can they take off in the Explorer, heading into a magic portal - the gateway to their next adventure.",
