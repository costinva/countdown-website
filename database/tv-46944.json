  "overview": "Join Dave for a TV mental health fundraiser, Comedy Against Living Miserably, to celebrate our partnership with CALM - the Campaign Against Living Miserably. As well as delivering first class stand-up comedy routines, the show will see the comedians openly and honestly discussing their own relationships with mental health, including issues such as eating disorders, cyber bullying, panic attacks and depression. The conversation merges seamlessly with the comedy routines to deliver a fresh and original take on stand-up comedy for a TV audience. Each episode, one each month, will be hosted by a headline act and will feature three leading comedians, all of which are donating their fee to CALM, which will be matched by UKTV. ",
