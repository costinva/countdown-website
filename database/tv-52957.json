  "overview": "But what is a piece? A patch, something put in place. And who is Lundini? Valerio Lundini is a Roman comedian poet of the surreal who is called every evening to replace a program that for various reasons cannot go on the air, putting \"a piece\" in it. He will punctuate the broadcast with his proverbial gags between the bizarre and the bewildered, in which irreverence will touch all areas, social and fashion, politics and entertainment.",
