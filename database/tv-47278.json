  "overview": "Contestants take on two, three, four or all five of the quiz's resident experts Mark Labbett, Anne Hegerty, Paul Sinha, Jenny Ryan and Shaun Wallace at once. Members of the audience are called out to face five multiple choice questions, with the chance to bank up to Â£5,000, but if they get the first question wrong they are out. Next, contestants are given the option of playing between two and all five Chasers for increasing amounts of money, but with a decreasing time advantage against them.",
