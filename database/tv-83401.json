  "overview": "Tsumugi is a female college student who carries trauma from an aggressive man in her past. She meets Kaname at a mixer she requested specifically for unaggressive \"herbivore\"-type men. She and Kaname hit it off, and Kaname resembles Tsumugi's older brother a little bit, so she relaxes her guard around him. Kaname, however, feigns to be a \"herbivore\"-type man, but is in reality an aggressive \"carnivore\"-type man, and he can change his demeanor in an instant.",
