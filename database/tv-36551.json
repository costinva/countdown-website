  "overview": "Inspired by the real-life young adults who choose to defy the strict conventions of their closed orthodox societies and join the army, this powerful character-driven drama delivers a compelling story focusing on the dilemmas of personal and religious identity, and the desire to belong alongside the need to express oneself and one's values.In Israel, 18 year olds must join the army by law â€“ but 9% of Israelis are Orthodox Jews, and they are exempt from service due to their religious beliefs. Some choose to disobey, and for these orthodox teens on the brink of manhood, their decision will leave them torn between an aggressive military system, an equally strict religious world and the forbidden temptations of secular life.",
