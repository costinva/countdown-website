  "overview": "Lola is a wealthy mother with two children who witnesses the drift of the youngest of them, Lorenzo, towards the darkness of a radical group. The story follows the footsteps of today's most uncomfortable, and abounds, by narrating Lola's conflict, in early motherhood and the old stigma of being left-handed.
