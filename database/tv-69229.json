  "overview": "It's the Hatfields &amp; McCoys on hot asphalt. Ramming, spin-outs and fistfights are not unheard-of at the \"Madhouse\", a quarter-mile racetrack in Winston-Salem, NC. There, daring local drivers show their love of cars and savvy ingenuity as they retool, redesign, rebuild and re-customize their cars for the big race on Saturday night. The new series with its colorful characters shows us a historic slice of culture, in a racing tradition that dates back to the days of running moonshine.",
