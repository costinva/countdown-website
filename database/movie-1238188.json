  "overview": "1575 Algiers, Miguel de Cervantes, a wounded 28-year-old Spanish Navy soldier, is held prisoner by Ottoman corsairs. Faced with a ticking clock, a cruel death awaits him should his fellow countrymen fail to pay his ransom soon; but within the confines of his cell, Cervantes discovers a surprising refuge - the art of storytelling. Crafted from resilience and hope, his stories enthral his fellow captives and capture the attention of Hasan, the enigmatic and feared Bey of Algiers. With a secret affinity ignited between captor and captive, suspicions rise amidst growing tensions in the city; Cervantes, driven by an unwavering sense of optimism, devises a daring plan for freedom.",
