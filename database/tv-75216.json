  "overview": "What happens when an entertainer so iconic peels back the curtain on the realities of an unexpected life? In Wayne Brady: The Family Remix, Brady has turned the term \"modern family\" on its head. He's still best friends with his ex-wife, soulmate, and business partner, Mandie Taketa. Together, they co-parent their 21-year-old daughter, Maile Brady, a student and aspiring artist, as well as running their production company, A Wayne &amp; Mandie Creative (\"Wayne Brady's Comedy IQ\"). Jason Fordham, Mandie's life partner since 2009, handles the family's cinematography and post-production; and Mandie and Jason have an almost 3-year-old son, Sundance-Isamu.Â ",
