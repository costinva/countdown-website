  "overview": "Who's Still Standing is a new competitive series that offers contestants the chance to win by out-guessing 10 opponents in 10 fast-paced and dramatic trivia battles. At the start of the game, each player stands behind a coin whose value ranges between $1.00 and $50,000. The value of the coin is hidden from the players and will not be revealed until one of them loses and drops out of the game, literally. This is by falling through the trapdoor in the studio floor on which he or she is standing.\t",
