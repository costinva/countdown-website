  "overview": "A comedy series about saving family relationships. The lives of Andrei and Kristina Konovalov have long been mired in the mundane, losing their vibrant colors, and the family hearth has completely extinguished. At the suggestion of friends, the couple turns to sex coach Boris and enrols in the course 'Sexual Resurrection'. During the training, Andrei and Kristina immerse themselves in experiments that seem strange, amusing, and some even frightening, pushing them out of their comfort zone. During the 'resurrection' process, the couple realises that their intimate life is just a small part of the puzzle, and the real problem of their faded relationship lies much deeper.",
