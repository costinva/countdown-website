The powerful aristocrats who occupy high positions are oppressive and fail to fulfill their duties, resulting in the people's suffering. Su Leyu is a noble aristocrat, forced to marry her childhood sweetheart, the new emperor Yin Changyan, who is suspected of regicide and seizing the throne. However, Leyu remains sincere with a vision committed to equality.
