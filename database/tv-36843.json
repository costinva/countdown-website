  "overview": "Lydia is a theatrical ballet master, for which there is nothing more important than the work and her only daughter, Margarita. Lydia is not used to making compromises and is characterized by a severe tough temper. Young Rita is not at all like her mother. A small and slightly plump girl is famous for her gentleness, kindness and sincere sympathy.  When a new dancer appears in Lydia's company, handsome Maxim Morozov, the naive Rita immediately falls in love. But experience tells Lydia that Maxim is only using her daughter for the main role. Lydia is experienced enough to see Maxim as a selfish narcissus.  To protect Margarita from the coming disappointment and heartache, the choreographer decides to destroy the relationship of her daughter with the dancer. But the mother's plan goes out of control. ",
