  "overview": "Ekin-Su and Davide had a fantastic journey on Love Island filled with romance, tiffs and tiramisu. They won the hearts of the public and were eventually crowned the Love Island winners. Now, after a summer of love, the couple are set to bring back the flirting, fun and laughter to our screens. Boarding passes at the ready, this two-part series devised and co-produced by Lifted Entertainment, part of ITV Studios, and Motion Content Group, will see the self-proclaimed ‘Italian Snack' and ‘Turkish Delight' pack their suitcases once again for two new adventures. ",
