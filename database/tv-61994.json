  "overview": "Takashi Ten is called to a mahjong club one night to play against Hiroyuki Igawa, a young mahjong player. Having just robbed his friends blind at mahjong, Takashi arrives to take back his winnings. Takashi's mahjong style becomes more apparent as the game progresses - amateurish. Takashi cheats in the last round, using a move called the Tsubame Gaeshi, and winning with a Tenhou hand. Hiroyuki is angered once Takashi admits he cheated after the game. Will he come to understand Takashi's \"Way of Tenhou\", where Takashi willingly cheats and gets beat up in response for his friends? Will Takashi unlock his true mahjong potential or cheat forever?",
