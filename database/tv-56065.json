  "overview": "Welcome to Crash Course Artificial Intelligence! In this series host Jabril Ashe will teach you the logic behind AI by tracing its history and examining how it's being used today. We'll even show you how to create some of your own AI systems with the help of co-host John Green Bot! We'll also spend several episodes on an area of AI known as machine learning which has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. AI is everywhere right now and has the potential to do amazing things in our lives. But there's also great potential for peril, which is why we believe it is more important than ever that developers, and non-developers alike, understand AI.",
