  "overview": "In this series, camera's follow the lives of three sets of characterful Brits who've fallen for France and made it their home.In this funny and irreverent look beneath the surface of the French dream, we experience what it's really like to live in France. The scenery may be idyllic and the wine flows like water, but can you get a decent cup of tea? No... and don't get us started on the milk! More than 150,000 Brits live in France, and we're tagging along with some of them to find out what all the fuss is about.",
