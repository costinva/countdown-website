  "overview": "Adapted from the mangua \"Yao Guai Jiu Guan\" (妖怪酒馆) by Mu Ba (目八).Bai Qi, the owner of the Demon Tavern, is good at bartending, and the wine he concocts can bring guests into a dream. Sommelier Fu Yu came to the tavern. Just as the two were arguing about Bai Qi's bartending level, the obsessive guests walked into the fantasy tavern that healed the soul one after another. In the dream, Fu Yu turned into a demon hunter, and Bai Qi turned into a little white dragon. Together with the guests, they experience the most affectionate people in the world and emotional events, eliminate obsessions, obtain healing, and reconcile with the past. The family, friendship, love and other life situations in a series of adventures have made Bai Qi and Fu Yu grow and become close friends who are bound by each other. ",
