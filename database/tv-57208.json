  "overview": "Tien, a Chinese-Thai business tycoon and his wife, Liu had four sons â€“ Traipob, Traitep, Traipoom , and Traiwit. Tien had planned his sons' lives from what they should study to whom they should be married to without caring about their willingness. Traitep got married with Ruengrin and Traipoom got married with Wallapa, while Traipob who was very religious, chose to stay single. All of Tein's three sons helped Tien in his textile business but Traiwit, the youngest son, didn't want to be like his older brothers. He decided to become a policeman, and left his home to move to the North-Eastern part of Thailand. There, he met Fahsai, the country girl who was a developer of her hometown. Traiwit didn't reveal his identity at first, so Fahsai thought Traiwit was trying to trick people in her hometown and didn't like him. Traiwit was transferred back to Bangkok, so he hired Fahsai to marry him and to help him fight against his father. He brought her back home to try to make his dad accept what he wanted to be. Tien couldn't accept Fahsai and tried every way to get her out of the house with the help of Ruengrin and Orn-nisha, the girl that Tien wanted to match up with Traiwit. Fahsai had to strive to win Tien's heart, while she and Traiwit started to have real feelings for each other.",
