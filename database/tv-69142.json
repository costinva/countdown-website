Wandering in Dahuang, Jiu Yao from Gaoxin lost her identity and appearance. She settled in Qingshui Town and renamed as Wen Xiaoliu. The Prince Qiang Xuan of Xuanyuan was Xiaoliu's cousin. To find Xiaoliu, he travelled around Dahuang and came to Qingshui Town. In Qingshui Town, Xiaoliu saved Tushan Jing in danger and fell in love with him.
