  "overview": "Hidden away in the dark shadows of our nation's history are tales so terrifying, they must be true. Now, veteran actor and legendary horror movie icon Robert Englund (you may know him as Freddy Krueger of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise!) scours news reports of the past to bring viewers twisted tales ripped straight from the headlines in True Terror with Robert Englund. In each episode, Englund uses his ominous tones and creepy charisma to masterfully weave together a trilogy of spine-tingling tales, guided by newspaper accounts and layered with commentary from historians and experts that prove that truth is always stranger than fiction.  ",
