  "overview": "Starring Mike Dudds and Pete Sutton in a mid-70s, recession-hit Britain. With no qualifications, but plenty of mouth and enthusiasm - which sets the scene for a serious of six adventures, all of which were originally aimed at a tea time teen audience, many of whom were no doubt in the same boat.",
