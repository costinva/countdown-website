  "overview": "This is the program whose creators are waiting for self-made videos of ordinary people who show with their talent how they make the days spent at home during the quarantine due to the coronavirus varied, exciting, entertaining and productive. The show shows how its creator experiences the quarantine at home, how he pursues his hobbies and how he accomplishes everything he didn't have time for before. It can be a home concert from the balcony, dancing with pets, juggling, baking pancakes, really anything. From the submitted videos, the four-member jury of Made in Karantén, Laci Gáspár, ByeAlex, Dóra Sztarenki and Győző Szabó, will select the best of the broadcast, the creator of which will be enriched with HUF 1 million.",
