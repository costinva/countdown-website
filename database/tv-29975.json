  "overview": "Nosotros los Guapos is a Mexican television series produced by Guillermo del Bosque for Televisa by the chain platform Blim and Las Estrellas. Vítor and Albertano pursue the same objective, to obtain a place where to live and, very to their regret, to look for a work that allows them to survive and to pay the rent of the room that both decide to share at Doña Cuca's house. Since they are found, various stories are intertwined that will come to life in each chapter, where by \"forced coincidences of life\", El Vítor and Albertano will go through funny, unexpected and gossipy situations that will test their budding friendship. Although at first they do not like each other, from the first day they decide to get together to get work in whatever they can. One day we will see them as microbuseros, another will rent out Chamberlains, risk hiring as two funny clowns, without planning to become actors, fighters, tourist guide and even two naive illegal who believe they reach the United States. From day one, Vítor and Albertano will have to \"endure\" with their differences in tastes and ways of seeing life, which will make the series one of the favorites of the public.",
