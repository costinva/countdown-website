  "overview": "Program in which Chantal Janzen sets to work with her infectious enthusiasm and sense of humor in her completely unknown fields. Chantal accepts the invitation from the most diverse companies to come and work fully. From fire brigade to supermarket and from zoo to garbage truck: she is more than welcome everywhere and gets to hear inspiring personal stories. She experiences the enthusiasm and knowledge with which these professions are practiced. A whole new world is always opening up for her, because everything is unknown territory for her.",
