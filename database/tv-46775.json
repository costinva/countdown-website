  "overview": "The Red family, led by Iryna, had an excellent family business on the Zhytomyr highway, the \"Podorozhnyk\" restaurant, and for many years dreamed of expanding it. Day by day, year by year, the family raised money to purchase another motel and restaurant complex. Only...On the long-awaited day X to Zhytomyr, Susanna Fortsa arrives from the heart of Milan and buys this motel and restaurant complex earlier. And she does not come by herself, but with her Italian husband, Mario, a Michelin chef with two stars. And then a hurricane of competition breaks out between two restaurants - \"Podorozhnyk\" and \"Piantadzhinne\", two cuisines – Ukrainian and Italian, and two rivals from school days – Iryna and Susanna. Meanwhile, restaurateurs beat pots, the hearts of their children, Ania and Aleks, were linked by Cupid, and now real Shakespearean passions, seasoned with high-quality humor, are boiling on the Zhytomyr highway.",
