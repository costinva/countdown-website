After losing his beloved girlfriend and mentor in the same accident, Dr. Du left the disappointed healthcare system and became an EMT in a small clinic.

With his frenemy Dr. Lee and associate Dr. Hsu all around his life in critical moments, he has to deal with patient-provider relationships and life value differences between colleagues. Dr. Du believes that the only way to reform the medical system is to be part of it again. However, the mysteries about the disaster twenty years ago will blow his life in more time.",
