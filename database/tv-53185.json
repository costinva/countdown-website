  "overview": "The life of Loli, a professional and independent woman, takes an unexpected turn when her best friend, Mariana, dies. She receives an inheritance that she does not think she can handle, but shows her that the true meaning of success is in family and love. Suddenly, she must take over as foster mom for Sam and Nicky, Mariana's children, and counts on the help of Rafael Contreras, her boss at the radio station. He is a man with whom she collides professionally and, despite all efforts, with whom she ends up falling in love.",
