  "overview": "In the Blocco, gang clashes see confronting Bea, torn between her role as Segundera and her hope for a normal life, and Mahdi, who tries hard to cover the void left by his uncle. Between them is a gang of brash young boys, the Kasba: multi-ethnic, loud, irrepressible. Leading them are Zak and Nael, two 20-year-olds of Arab descent determined to make their own way, in music as in life. Ludo's return to town, hurt and lost after an event for which he bears the blame, leads Bea, Ludo and Mahdi to come to terms with the bond that each, in his own way, tries to deny. But together they are stronger: so between old friends and new enemies, the pressures of expectations and a life that seems to play with them as if they were pawns, Bea, Ludo and Mahdi unite again in a no-holds-barred adventure.",
