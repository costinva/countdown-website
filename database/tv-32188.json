  "overview": "Etaten is a Norwegian comedy series. The series is built around Atle Antonsen in the role of a delayed head of department in the Planning and Building Agency. The series received its inspiration from the Planning and Building Agency in Ullensaker municipality.The series is a fictional documentary and a parody of public bureaucracy and case processing, where a series of conversions and everyday problems create a very inefficient and little customer-friendly \"service\". In this way, the agency has many similarities to the British series The Office.",
