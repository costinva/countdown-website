  "overview": "On board their truck workshop, Fred, Jamy and Sabine make us discover that science is everywhere around us. Fred and Sabine, curious and adventurers, lead the life-size observations. They explore places often inaccessible and guide us to the heart of the subject. Thanks to his clever and simple models, Jamy, scholar and pedagogue, highlights their observations in his laboratory truck. Nothing better to understand a natural phenomenon or a scientific theory!",
