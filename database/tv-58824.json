With no memories of their own, these four very special men are charged with harvesting the love, family, and friendships of A104, the region of the world to which they've been assigned. Going about their work, all of them, repeatedly cross paths with Xiang Ling Er, a girl who constantly seems to be in danger. While none of the Mr. Times can remember Xiang Ling Er, they can't help but shake the feeling that she is somehow connected to them.Â ",
