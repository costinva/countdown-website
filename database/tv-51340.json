  "overview": "Just when you thought that video of the guy falling over during his wedding vows was the funniest thing you'd seen in; oh, I don't know, 5 minutes, along comes 3 fearless, ballsy and downright funny non-blondes to brighten up the box. Gary Reich, the man who started the hidden-camera careers of Sacha Baron Cohen and Dom Joly, has found three women to take to the streets and carry the genre just that little bit further. Tameka Empson, Jocelyn Jee Esien and Ninia Benjamin take their characters and talents of comedy improv to the crowds and cities of Britain to see how we behave. The cast list includes tarts who tout for Jesus, buskers doing bad African performance poetry and a virgin who gets sex advice from a variety of sources, including a bakery. Nothing is sacred and no-one is safe. Watch this for the thrill of witnessing where society meets character sketch meets that story you just won't believe happened to me the other day.",
