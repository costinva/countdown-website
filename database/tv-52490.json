  "overview": "The Teacher series 2 follows the story of Dani, a teacher who loves her job. She's a mentor and inspiration to her students, but what she lacks is a properly functioning marriage with real intimacy and mutual desire. This leads her into an impulsive affair with a fellow colleague that at first answers all her needs, but soon spirals out of control.When a pupil goes missing on a school trip, Dani rightly blames herself for being too easily distracted. When things take a sinister turn, she is forced to lie, and quickly finds her life falling to pieces. She risks everything to right the wrongs that she has, in part, been responsible for.",
