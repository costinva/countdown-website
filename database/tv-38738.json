  "overview": "Forget Old MacDonald! The Webnar family-turned-farmers are coming to TLC in the network's newest series Little Life on the Prairie, premiering Monday, August 20 at 10/9c. Lauren, Nate and their four-year-old daughter Juniper Webnar were born with achondroplasia dwarfism, but that hasn't stopped them from chasing big dreams. In search of a simpler life that's more conducive to raising and expanding their family, the Webnars decided to move from the bustle of big-city living in California to a farm in the countryside of Arizona. In its six-episode run, TLC's Little Life on the Prairie will follow the family's effort to run a farm, adjust to country life and expand their family despite major health risks and medical challenges.",
