  "overview": "A fragile-looking chemistry teacher, Rita, is left without a job because of her connections with a student. But thanks to her skills, she manages to earn easy money cleaning the cottage. True, this cottage turns out to be a crime scene, and Rita herself finds herself at the epicenter of the criminal showdowns of local bandits. However, Rita is not so simple - all this time she lived undercover on someone else's passport. A few years ago, she already had to flee from her native St. Petersburg to a seaside town in order to save her life. After all, Rita is the only living carrier of the formula, which her pursuers really need.",
