  "overview": "COBRA deals with an unfolding national emergency that threatens to engulf the country as the COBRA committee, a team comprised of Britain's leading experts, crisis contingency planners and most senior politicians fights to ensure the protection of the people of Great Britain. The Prime Minister and his Chief of Staff must contend with impossible political decisions, whilst also wrestling with ferociously pressured personal lives. Not only do they bear the weight of public expectation and their family's needs; they must also be mindful of their political opponents who will use any sign of weakness as an opportunity to strike.",
