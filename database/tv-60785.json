  "overview": "Kiki Inoue works part-time at a convenience store, spending the better part of her day lazing about or reviewing sweets on her social media account. One day at work, she is introduced to the chain's CEO, Takumi Asaba, who, as it turns out, is familiar with Inoue's online reviews. Asaba asks Inoue to develop new desserts to sell chain-wide. As CEO, Asaba is tasked with turning around the chain's fortunes, as it is now ranked the lowest among its competitors. Close collaboration leads Inoue and Asaba to become sweet on each other.",
