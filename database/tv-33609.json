  "overview": "Little Women is a new three-part series based on Louisa May Alcott's universally beloved novel.Set against the backdrop of a country divided, the story follows the four March sisters: Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy on their journey from childhood to adulthood while their father is away at war. Under the guidance of their mother Marmee, the girls navigate what it means to be a young woman: from gender roles to sibling rivalry, first love, loss and marriage. Accompanied by the charming boy next door Laurie Laurence, their cantankerous wealthy Aunt March and benevolent neighbour Mr. Laurence, Little Women is a coming of age story that is as relevant and engaging today as it was on its original publication in 1868.",
