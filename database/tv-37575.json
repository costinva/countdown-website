  "overview": "Super Junior Mini-Drama was a variety game show hosted by the Korean boy band Super Junior where they would write, produce and star in their own drama series. Before each drama episode, the members will play games to determine which of two teams Prince Team or Pearl Blue Team they will be part of. The winning team will get a bonus feature for their drama. Their performances are judged and rated online, and at the end whichever team gets the most points receives a vacation to Japan.",
