  "overview": "Epic Warrior Women highlights the women who fought just as courageously, skillfully and fiercely as male warriors of their time. With stunning re-enactments, original costumes, historic locations and CG animation, the three-part series chronicles the military achievements of the original Amazon horse warriors of the Steppe, probes the highly-trained female gladiators of Ancient Rome and concludes with the feared all-female regiments of Dahomey that shaped African history.",
