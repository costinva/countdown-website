  "overview": "Beetle Bailey, the private who would rather drop and nap than drop and \"do 20\" is the wise cracking joker of Camp Swampy, where befuddled General Halftrack still hasn't heard from the Pentagon, grumbling Sgt. Snorkle has never had a date, Beetle hasn't washed his socks, and Cooke still makes those high-bouncing meatballs.",
