  "overview": "World's Most Epic reveals the technical mysteries and secret history behind airplanes, tanks, ships, cars, trains, and more. They are remarkably powerful and have all had a profound impact on land, water, and air transport. Each episode will focus on a different class of vehicle, ranging from flying giants, to ships unmatched for their cutting-edge technology, to monster tanks, muscular mega cars, and amazing trains. Among those looked at are the king of the paved roads, the Bugatti Chiron; the Pilatus Railway that manages to climb grades of over 40 percent; the CV90, the most modern and versatile infantry fighting tank in the world, and the world's most exclusive business jet that can be booked for $700,000 per hour.",
