  "overview": "Xiao Ru is a naive and inexperienced wanderer in the martial arts world, only skilled in trivial combat techniques. She's mischievous, impoverished, and cowardly, often resorting to deceit and trickery while being secretly helpful and kind-hearted. Suddenly, she transforms into a foolish young lady named Murong Zhuwan, who becomes the target of bullying. Ignorant about love, Xiao Ru encounters Murong Chong, the person she develops feelings for, and is reluctantly drawn into the conflicts of the martial world. She also encounters Fu Hong, who mistakenly believes he has been betrayed and harbors resentment due to love. Murong Chong, Zhuwan, and Fu Hong struggle to survive amidst various conspiracies in the martial world, and their conflicts intensify. While enjoying glory and power, the three of them bear pressure and responsibilities, growing in unfamiliar adversity. They become brave and resilient for the sake of love, striving together and ultimately conquering the martial world.",
