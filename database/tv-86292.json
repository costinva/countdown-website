  "overview": "Say You Love Me (사랑한다 말해줘) is a poignant drama that delves into the fragile beauty of youthful love and the painful weight of adult regrets. Kim Byung-soo and Seo Young-chae have grown up together, bound by shared dreams and a quiet, enduring affection. As they step into the world of filmmaking, their bond begins to blossom into something deeper—an innocent, wholehearted romance that offers them both a sense of belonging.But their world is disrupted when they enter the orbit of Cho In-ah, a powerful and ambitious film company executive who once chose career over love. Haunted by the emotional void in her life, In-ah finds herself drawn to Byung-soo's sincerity and resents the warmth she sees between him and Young-chae. Driven by a mix of desire and jealousy, she becomes determined to fracture their love—enlisting her partner Park Hee-soo in a quiet campaign to intervene.As emotions clash and intentions blur, *Say You Love Me* becomes a layered exploration of love in its many forms—innocent, manipulative, desperate, and sacrificial. With emotionally resonant performances and a melancholic undercurrent, the drama asks whether love can truly survive ambition, insecurity, and betrayal—or whether saying \"I love you\" is sometimes not enough.",
