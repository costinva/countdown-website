  "overview": "When Jinxiu Kingdom is on the brink of defeat in the battle at Pingling, the female archer in red, Fu Yixiao, shoots an arrow at Susha's eldest prince, Feng Suige, turning the tide of the battle. But Yixiao accidentally falls off a cliff shortly after and loses her memory. After Yixiao is rescued by the Ling family of doctors of the Righteous Villa, she unexpectedly reunites with her old enemy Suige. Looking at the mess Yixiao is in, Suige infers that it must be related to his predicament in the battle at Pingling. Suige wants to use Yixiao to find out the truth behind the scenes, while Yixiao wants to use Suige to survive under heavy pursuit. So the two, who were mortal enemies a month ago, must now rely on each other to survive in the turbulent Yujing City, and their love secretly blossoms through countless near-death experiences. The seeds have been sown, and amid the hatred, betrayal, deception, unrequited desire, and inability to let go, everyone is both a player and a pawn. Yixiao and Suige can only work closely together in the storm to overcome the dark conspiracy, break the shackles of fate, live up to the people expectations, and not let each other down.Â ",
