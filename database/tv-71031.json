  "overview": "Due to a childhood competition, Lin Ge was recommended by Nie Chi to enter a sports school and began her career in short track speed skating. Lin Ge is optimistic, bold, and detail-oriented, while Nie Chi is calm, sharp, and full of ideals. Under the loving care of their fatherly coach, Fang Shizhong, they grew up and entered the provincial team with Fang's son, Fang Chao. Lin Ge was trapped in a complex family that favored boys and had irregular training and weak foundations, while Nie Chi found it difficult to adapt to team tactical training due to his straightforward and cold personality. Despite facing setbacks in training, the trio supported each other, and Nie Chi gradually developed feelings for Lin Ge. With the successful bid for the Beijing Winter Olympics, they quickly grew from wild students in the sports school to members of the national training team under the careful guidance of the experienced provincial coach Han Bing. They met, competed, and parted with various teammates and opponents, overcoming injuries, difficulties, and the confusion of fame. Eventually, they joined hands and stepped onto the international arena, defending national honor with their youthful passion.",
