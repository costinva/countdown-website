  "overview": "British families explore beautiful Britain in their own beloved caravans, campervans or motorhomes to bring us the ultimate guide to the very best campsites in Britain and help us all plan our future staycations.Each week, the campers head off to explore a popular caravanning region, from Cornwall to the Highlands.  They stay at a different campsite each day, enjoying on and off-site activities and visiting nearby attractions. These sites may boast stunning views, private beaches, adventure pursuits or spa facilities, but which will be our campers' favourite and win The Perfect Pitch regional title?",
