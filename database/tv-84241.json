  "overview": "\"Your Ways\" is the first documentary film-journey with the participation of priests. Archpriest Viktor Ivanov, Imam Hamza Khafizov and actor Ilya Glinnikov travel 2000 kilometers from Ufa to Donetsk with a humanitarian mission to support military personnel. On the way, they meet representatives of various religious communities, trying to find answers to eternal questions in conversations with them: about the purpose of man, his connection with God, love, repentance, the nature of good and evil. This is a film story about the study of the human soul and a story about representatives of different faiths and peoples who are ready to unite for a common goal.",
