  "overview": "The average British family spends £5,000 a year on holidays so could you buy a dream holiday home in your favourite foreign destination for just double that cost? That is the challenge that Julia Bradbury is taking on in £10k Holiday Home.Julia's inspiration comes from the ingenious owners who have bought properties overseas and in the UK for under £10k and renovated them with stunning results from exquisite stone cottages to a cave which was purchased for one Euro, to Italian mountain retreats.",
