  "overview": "Kristopher Schau tries in seven programs to violate the seven deadly sins - and sees whether all will be forgiven in the eighth! Here is the vanity which, according to the old annals, is about not cultivating eternal youth, not pilling at the creation of God and not committing to pervert sin. That's why Kristopher and his friends naturally go to Los Angeles, where Kristopher sits under the knife, uses his own cock as a model for a massage show and participates in a gay pride parade.",
