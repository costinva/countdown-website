  "overview": "Cheng Tian Xiang, a sunny young man who loves tennis, rescues a young girl, Lin Xiao Ruo, and accidentally meets her cold brother, Lin Xiao Nan, an ice-cold outward appearance and a soft-hearted general manager of an enterprise. Cheng Tian Xiang's innocence gradually melts Lin Xiao Nan's defences, and the two of them move from antagonism to ambiguity, with love quietly sprouting.Â However, the entanglement of old love and the emergence of new love make this relationship full of twists and turns. Will they be able to cross the heart wall and embrace their own happiness?",
