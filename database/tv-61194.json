  "overview": "Utagawa Kotoha is a bright 25-year-old woman. She is sometimes timid, but she is also a curious person. Through her friend's introduction, Kotoha Utagawa moves to apartment #7 in an apartment building exclusively for women. There, she gets involved with weird phenomenons. She happens to meet Nakame Reishi. He introduces himself as a psychic, but he doesn't have psychic abilities. This is in spite of Reishi Nakame's grandmother being an itako (blind women who are trained to become a spiritual medium). His aunt Iwato Shima is also the head of a Shinto shrine. Kotoha Utagawa and Reishi Nakame ask Shima Iwato to perform an exorcism.",
