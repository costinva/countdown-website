  "overview": "In Julestjerna we follow eight artists that we get to know through a singing competition. Each of the participants carries their secrets and stories, and when the stage lights go out, it turns out that there are completely different things that become decisive than who wins. Eventually, it is charity, warmth, infatuation and closeness that apply.",
