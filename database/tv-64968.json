  "overview": "Asuka had once realized her goal to become a teacher, but after a gutting failure, she gives up her dream profession and becomes extremely withdrawn. After a series of events, she finds herself becoming a live-in housemother for a dorm... where the boy band septet 8LOOM live together! At the dorm, she is reunited with her former student Danâ€”as a teacher, Asuka used to encourage him to go for his dreams. Inspired by Dan's leadership in the band and his passion for making his dream come true, Asuka, too, regains the passion she had in her teaching days and comes to terms with her own failure.",
