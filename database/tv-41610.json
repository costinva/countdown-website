  "overview": "The story takes place in Turin, which, with its old-time atmospheres, the sumptuous baroque buildings, the caf√©s, the grand boulevards and the squares, lends itself well to the background of this compelling relational thriller in which Laura, teacher at a high school in Turin, agrees to go out for a date with Andrea, an esteemed surgeon and father of one of his students. The evening proceeds in the best way, but the next day, while Andrea hopes to see her again, Laura denounces him for rape.",
