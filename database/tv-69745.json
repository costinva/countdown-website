  "overview": "A report exposed that the renowned corporate giant JuLun Group in Canghai City has covered up the truth about a mining disaster that occurred years ago. Deputy Director Qu Jianghe becomes the focal point of the anti-crime and anti-evil campaign. When he gets involved in the investigation, he realizes that the line between right and wrong in reality is no longer clear-cut. Due to various interests at stake, his opponents, friends, and even his superiors all demand the concealment of the truth. The newly appointed female director Yan Ge is also shocked by the harsh and heroic reality. Covering up is a greater evil than the crime itself.Â ",
