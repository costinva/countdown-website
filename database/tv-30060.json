  "overview": "Cincinnati Bengals star wide receiver Chad Ochocinco (formerly Chad Johnson) is using his off-season to pursue happiness off the field in his new VH1 original series, Ochocinco: The Ultimate Catch. The series is a mix of Ochocinco's on-field charisma blended with the drama of the dating pool played out in a bracket-style dating tournament. This season starts with Terrell back on the free market where he needs to decide if he wants to continue his football career and find another team or hang up his cleats and figure out what his life will be post football.",
