  "overview": "In Logan, Queensland, The Toolbox Murders begins with the brutal killings of Cory Breton and Iuliana Triscaru. Cory, wrongly suspected of being a police informant, and Iuliana, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, are lured to a drug den by a gang led by Stou Daniels. What follows is a deadly cocktail of drug-fuelled paranoia and brutality. The victims are violently tortured, locked in a large metal toolbox, and transported on the back of a ute to Scrubby Creek, where they are drowned alive.",
