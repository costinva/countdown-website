  "overview": "Five seasoned Rock Stars descend on Las Vegas to form a band and save Rock and Roll. The catch? None of them know who their band mates are ahead of time. Motor City Madman; Ted Nugent, Former Skid Row frontman; Sebastian Bach and Anthrax's Scott Ian team up with drummer (Led Zeppelin heir) Jason Bonham and Biohazard's Evan Seinfeld to live together, form a band, write new music and perform a concert in just 12 days. Legendary Rock Manager Doc McGhee is enlisted to keep these legendary Rock egos in check, and keep the mission on track. Together, in a city of sin, they struggle to navigate the drinking, fighting, lap dances and somehow find the time to write, rehearse, and put on a show worthy of their formidable rock legacies. Five Rock Stars. 12 Days. No Excuses. This is Supergroup.",
