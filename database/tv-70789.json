  "overview": "From Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine and the producers of Vanderpump Rules, if you were given the chance to bring your fantasy love story to life on TV, how would it look? Would it be a picture-perfect fairy tale or something a bit messier? This uniquely unscripted romantic series follows five women at different stages in their lives as they experience reimagined romance in the picturesque small town of Fairhope, Alabama, a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone else's business and matters of the heart matter most. In Love in Fairhope, real people star in a story inspired by their own where fantasy and reality collide.",
