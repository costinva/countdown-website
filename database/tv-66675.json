  "overview": "The Great American Joke Off celebrates gags, wisecracks, one-liners and the simple art of telling a great joke. Hosted by Dulcé Sloan, the show features several riotous rounds in each episode that involve telling as many quick gags as possible on given categories, mashing different subjects together to create delicious puns, coming up with hilarious set-ups to different punchlines, or even using the texts on an audience member's phone as a springboard for jokes. Dulcé decides which team has won each round based on who she thinks has been the funniest.",
