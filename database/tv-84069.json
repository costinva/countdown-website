  "overview": "Diana Salazar is a woman who has been plagued all of her life with the ability to move things with her mind. Now, engaged to Dr. Omar Santelmo, she is having dreams about herself set in 16th century colonial Mexico. More intriguing is the fact that her psychiatrist, Dr. Irene del Conde, was her rival in the dream for the love of another man. As the story unfolds, Diana realizes that it wasn't a dream, but a memory of a past life.",
