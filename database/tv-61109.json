  "overview": "Have You Seen This Man? is a three-part limited docuseries that centers on the disappearance of fraudster John Ruffo. Hosted by Sunny Hostin, the series features one of the longest, most intense hunts in U.S. history. In 1997, the FBI arrested John Ruffo, who ran a small computer sales company from New York City, for committing a staggering $353 million bank fraud. After conviction, Ruffo disappeared without a trace, and U.S. marshals have been searching 24 years for one of the United States' Most Wanted Fugitives. The series takes viewers on a journey as cold case investigators span the globe and uncover surprising details about Ruffo's mysterious past. After a judge sentenced Ruffo to a 17 ½ year federal prison term, Ruffo avoided it and drove instead to John F. Kennedy Airport. Have You Seen This Man? follows U.S. marshals as they search for clues and receive fresh tips that lead them across the globe from California to Italy. Featuring interviews with retired and active U.S. marshals, as well as members of Ruffo's family, the docuseries examines Ruffo's case from the beginning and presents an up-close look into the investigative process behind the search. Have You Seen This Man? asks for help from the public to offer information or tips on the fugitive's whereabouts. ",
