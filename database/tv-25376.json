  "overview": "They have no natural predators; they eat four times as much as an alligator; and if they're not stopped, they could destroy one of America's most important ecosystems. Now an elite squad of three licensed hunters is fighting back. As they capture snakes, the Python Hunters look for clues to how the invaders came to be established in the Everglades. Popular perception is that the snakes are the progeny of family pets released into the wild by irresponsible owners no longer willing or able to care for them. The Python Hunters though consider a more likely explanation is an incident in 1992, when a greenhouse at the edge of the Everglades, housing over 900 Burmese Pythons, was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew.",
