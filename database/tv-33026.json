  "overview": "Sleepwalkers revolved around Dr. Nathan Bradford who is the head of the team that had developed a technology to enter the dreams of psychiatric patients to discover what their true problems were. He also uses the machines to enter the unconscious mind of his wife, Gail Bradford, who is in a coma. The other members of the team are Kate Russell, the scholar of the group, with a vast knowledge of mythology and archetypes from many religions and Vincent Konefke is the technical guy who ran the machines but never dreamwalked himself. Steve Turner is the other sleepwalker.",
