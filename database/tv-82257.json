  "overview": "Meet the underdogs! They might be rescued, abandoned or just plain unruly, but these imperfect pooches all have one thing in common: they need a new purpose in life. Hosted by Alan Titchmarsh, our underdogs will be trained by experts to do incredible jobs. Each has a vision for what these dogs could achieve; from finding people lost in the wilderness, to rescuing from water, or a film stunt dog. We join them for the highs and lows of the training process, but time is ticking... Each of them must undergo a final challenge. Will these underdogs have it in them to become superdogs?",
