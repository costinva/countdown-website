  "overview": "Presented by Ian Thorpe, Bullied is a controversial and compelling insight into the issue of bullying that brings victims and their classmates together in an effort to help understand the impacts of bullying and create strategies for change.In Australia, the issue of bullying is well known. Lesser known is the fact that most commonly, bullying is not about one-on-one situations, it's about group behaviour.With identities concealed, the footage is shown to the victim's peers to help them understand the impact the bullying is having, and how they might work together to stop it happening. With the support of specialist psychologists, and examining specifically Australian scenarios, 'Bullied' will bring to light an issue that is widely talked about, but rarely understood.",
