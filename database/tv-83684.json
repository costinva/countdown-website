  "overview": "GPS, solar cells, Velcro and even baby formula are just some of the inventions space exploration has provided us. Now, Man's mission to go deeper into space has inspired further innovations in producing the food we eat. From the genesis of space food at NASA, to groundbreaking technology in Finland today, which creates protein out of air, scientists have been racing to reshape food production on Earth. Researchers examine how plants react to space conditions in Austria, the Netherlands, Israel and Thailand to grow the next superfood in harsh conditions on Earth. Meanwhile, in Singapore, microalgae grown in bioreactors for space shuttles could be applied in cities, even deserts. Space Farmers will make agriculture on space possible and the growing of food on Earth much more sustainable.",
