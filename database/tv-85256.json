  "overview": "The Book of Acts explosively reimagined in an alternate-modern era. A resurrection sparks a movement that turns the world upside down, spreading hope amid chaos. As the followers risk everything to preach the good news, the Temple races to silence them before the oppressive Imperium regime retaliates. But public miracles, unburied secrets, and fractured loyalties force both sides to confront the true cost of their choices.",
