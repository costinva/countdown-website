In this anniversary year, marking 350 years since his death, his surprising story is told from an unusual perspective - his own.This three-part series sets out to reveal the answers behind the mysteries and shadows still lurking in Rembrandt's personal life.Actor Toby Jones assumes the voice of the artist to explore how this explosive talent, in his youth the darling of Dutch high society, end up in a lowly rented grave.
