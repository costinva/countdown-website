  "overview": "Switched! is an American TV series that ran from 2003 through 2004 in which two teens from different cities in the United States were given a chance to swap lives to see how the other one lived. Teens were able to experience the lives of others and experiment with new families and cultures, and one of the places we visited on the show was Cary, North Carolina. Teen celebrities often starred on the show, such as pop singer Skye Sweetnam, Jennifer Freeman from My Wife and Kids, Ashlie Brillault from Lizzie McGuire, Alisa Brillault, basketball star Candace Parker, Jamie Lynn Spears from Zoey 101, and Kyle Sullivan from All That.",
