  "overview": "Ashley Paige: Bikini or Bust is half documentary/half soap opera about the daily struggles of being an independent fashion designer. Ashley desperately needs to find a way to overcome being a famous fashion designer who, despite being the toast of the fashion world, still doesn't have the resources or infrastructure to pay her rent, or manufacture her innovative designs on a mass scale. Along with her mom (Leah), her knitter (Jan) and a quirky staff of girls, it's an uphill battle, but Ashley is determined to make it to the top!",
