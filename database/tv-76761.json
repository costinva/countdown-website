  "overview": "Ancient Powers will bring together the history of early Eastern and Western civilisations; using stunning documentary visuals and stylish CGI to tell the extraordinary story of the world's greatest ancient cultures on one epic timeline, stretching back 5,000 years.Presented by world-leading historical specialists, each episode will use the very latest scientific and archaeological discoveries to reveal the tools, technologies, strategies and systems that decided the fate of Ancient Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, Greeks and Romans as they fought wars, battled the climate and established the rich and fascinating cultures which laid the foundations for the modern world.The series will show why the fortunes of some civilisations rose while others fell; ultimately revealing how the destinies of Ancient East and West became inextricably connected as global trade routes took shape and China's economic success saw it locked in competition with the Roman Empire.",
