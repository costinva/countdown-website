  "overview": "Hillary is a remarkably intimate portrait of a woman in the public eye, providing unprecedented personal access to the former First Lady and Secretary of State. The series offers revealing moments from never-before-seen 2016 campaign footage alongside biographical chapters of Clinton's life and seeks to examine how she became at once one of the most admired and vilified women in the world.",
