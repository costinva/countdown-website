  "overview": "Asgeir Borgemoen is back with a new round of motorbike with the Garasjen on Viasat 4. In the same style as before, he travels at home and abroad to meet new motorists, visit their garages and look at even more vehicles.Asgeir is himself an avid car enthusiast and, for the time being, he has helped others to turn on pictures, he has acquired his own car for the time being. We also participate in asphalt racing and drifting, rallycross, ice rinking and historical racing. In other words, it is just a matter of tightening up for new, rushing episodes of the garage.",
