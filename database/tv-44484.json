  "overview": "Twenty-five years of marriage: it's time to celebrate! A couple as envied as they are united, three children, two of whom are adopted, Isabelle Garnier is more than ever delighted with this success, her success, that of a lifetime! A pithy note from her husband left on the pillow, bank accounts emptied, in less than 24 hours, and now the life, as peaceful as it is installed, of this housewife, charitable bourgeois, a blessed ass nothing, turns to the survival operation.",
