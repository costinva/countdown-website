  "overview": "An outrageous doctor arrives at the clinic of an elementary school. His hair disheveled and constantly looking sullen, Dr. Makino is a \"physician\" by profession. \"Don't get on the bed without permission!\" \"As much as possible, try not to come to the clinic.\" \"What a hassle! Is this even my job?!\" Blunt and always complaining, Dr. Makino is a scary school physician who glares at everyone, be it the teachers or the children. But with his exceptional observation skills, he detects anomalies in the students and saves them, as well as their families and at times, the teachers. Set in an elementary school, this human drama features Dr. Makino, a mouthy pediatrician with a big attitude. Follow him as he uses his observation skills to detect the children's unspoken cries for help and offers them encouragement.",
