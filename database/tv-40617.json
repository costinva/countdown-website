  "overview": "Hailing from different cities across the country, six of the best barbecue masters meet in New York City to face off for a $50,000 grand prize and the right to claim the title Best in Smoke. Endurance and skill are the key ingredients as contestants take on multiple challenges for vastly different audiences, with limited resources. From barbecue desserts to single bite hors d'oeuvres, no food is off limits. Contestants show off their personal style and quick wit throughout the competition, but a final mad dash to three separate venues around Manhattan and Brooklyn will determine which competitor will win the ultimate prize.",
