  "overview": "Black Widow Murders features unique stories of diabolical women who turn society's assumptions about the \"fairer sex\" upside down â€“ luring their victims into gruesome deaths for wealth, lust or power. Whether it's a career con artist, serial divorcee or homemaker leading a secret double life, these cases offer seductive power fantasies where women take control in the most violent way imaginable. They won't stop until investigators finally bring them to justice.",
