  "overview": "Väinö and Gunn-Berit, Doc and Helene, Kristian and Monica and Daniel have decided to run their own campsite. The goal is to make a place where Norwegian rednecks can get out of all their dreaded creativity and joy in life. It should be both big enough, not too nice and so far away from the nearest neighbor that there is no quarrel when the night never falls.",
