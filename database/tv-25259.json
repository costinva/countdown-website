  "overview": "It's hard to believe that in less than two months, T.I. will be going to jail. With his incredibly busy schedule, Tip himself doesn't have time to dwell on it. He has work to do first. In addition to all the appearances he's been making to promote Paper Trail, he's been shooting movies, overseeing his artists' upcoming albums, being a family man and completing 1,000 hours of community service for felony weapons charges. In T.I.'s Road to Redemption, Tip gives viewers an intimate look at his family life at home. He shows the extremes he has go through to maintain his accustomed level of fan love and media exposure while giving talks to kids as part of his community service. In the show, the rapper also tries to motivate seven at-risk teens across the country to change their lives.",
