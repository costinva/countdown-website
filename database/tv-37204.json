  "overview": "Stath Lets Flats follows incompetent Greek-Cypriot lettings agent Stath, who works for the family business, Michael and Eagle. Stath's hapless sister Sophie dreams of being a professional dancer, but holds a candle for the family's favourite employee, nervous negotiator Al. While Stath wrestles not to be outshone by their top agent, ruthlessly ambitious Carole, the company struggles against the threat of Smethwicks - the slick, high-end estate agents next door.",
