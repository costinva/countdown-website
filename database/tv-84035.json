  "overview": "Impossible odds are part of the job.By 1942, severely weakened by the Nazis, the Allies implemented a daring new strategy for waging war. Their disruptive technique was to attack Hitler's Reich from within. Featuring the minute-by-minute accounts of the brave soldiers who crossed deep into enemy territory, Commando Missions recounts these heroic top-secret operations.In four spellbinding episodes that blend spectacular reconstructions with archives and animation, this premium series chronicles how these highly-trained guerrilla fighters slipped behind enemy lines to bring the German war machine to its knees. The near-impossible missions include: the upstream paddling expedition to disable German warships in Bordeaux; the six-man mission to destroy the Luftwaffe fleet at Heraklion; and, the deadly polar trek to take out an occupied Norwegian hydroelectric plant.",
