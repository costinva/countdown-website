  "overview": "Salty Tour is a travel variety program that emphasises on two things: good quality for the price and small luxury. For every city/country, three of the cast members are assigned as one-day tour guides and are given the same budget per person. The cast members will attempt to have the best vacation experience with a fixed price limit. The Small Luxury can only be won by the winning tour guide through the judging of the remaining cast members and invited guests for each day tour.",
