  "overview": "Dark-fired tobacco is one of the nation's oldest and richest cash crops, and notoriously precarious. This new series Tobacco Wars takes an unfiltered look inside the lives of fourth and fifth generation Adairville, Ky. farmers who bet everything they have on the high-stakes dark fire industry. In tobacco country, carefully guarded farming know-how and family traditions are passed down - and freedom is as essential as the air they breathe. It's a high-stress world, but these folks blow off steam with ease, living their country life to the fullest with endless wagering and outrageous country-boy hijinks.",
