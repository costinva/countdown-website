  "overview": "It's the summer of 1969 in the small coastal town of Stavanger, Northern Europe. International oil companies have been test drilling for years, but nothing has been found and they are in the process of leaving. Stavanger lives off fish, and the North Sea is emptying out. The town is in crisis. The night before Christmas 1969, Phillips Petroleum finds the largest sub sea oil basin in history. And everything is about to change.",
