  "overview": "Two unusual orderlies work in the forensic medical morgue of a hospital in the province: former criminal Pal Palych Shishko and retired opera Nikolai Kedrov. Men don't like each other, but they do a great job. One day, a young investigator, Dmitry Saykin, comes to their morgue. In management, they don't put a guy in anything and give him the most hopeless cases. Unexpectedly, Kedrov and Shishki reveal one of the crimes, naming the exact place, time, method of murder, and even the name of the culprit. All the credit goes to Saykin himself. From this moment, an unusual collaboration between the orderlies and the young investigator begins.",
