  "overview": "After serving as an MSNBC contributor and guest-host on the network for four years, TV and radio personality Michael Smerconish believed he was ready to head a show of his own. CNN agreed, and thus was born Smerconish, an hour long Saturday morning program that takes after its host's independent views. Using a topical, conversational format, he aims for the TV show to be an extension of his weekday radio broadcast, with free-flowing topics and the ability to discuss issues that strike a chord with the audience. Along the same lines, he thinks it's important to present the content in an engaging manner, free of my-way-or-the-highway ideology. Smerconish, who has a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania, is also a New York Times' best-selling author.",
