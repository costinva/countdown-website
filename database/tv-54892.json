  "overview": "Person On The Map is a rare encounter with Russians living in the country's modern-day outback, far from the relative prosperity of Moscow and St. Petersburg. Each episode focuses on a person – a teacher, a handicapped farmer, an inventor – who has opted for the provincial life and is eager to build a better world without leaving home. Hosted by Yekaterinburg-based journalist Yekaterina Ponomaryova.",
