  "overview": "Kiri and Lou is an animated series about empathy, hand-crafted in stop motion with creatures made of clay, in a forest of cut out paper. Each five minute story is told with humour and joy, about the friendship of two prehistoric creatures and their adventures in the forest a long, long time ago. Kiri and Lou laugh and sing and play all kinds of games with their friends, as they learn to deal with the emotions of childhood.",
