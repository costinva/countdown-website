  "overview": "When top companies choose the appeal of a dog for their brand they have to find the perfect pooch to front their advertising campaign. With a warm, fun take on talent show formats, Top Dog Model delves into the world of posing pooches as they and their owners experience the demands of modelling assignments including photo shoots, TV adverts and live appearances to see how they handle the real-life pressure. Can the owners keep their pets under control and can these pampered pups prove that they have more than just good looks? The final sees the two remaining dogs go head to head in a shoot for a new advertising campaign, where the winner becomes the face of a top brand.",
