  "overview": "Il Baracchino, once the coolest comedy club around, is now a drunken, cockroach-infested diveâ€¦and it could soon become a Doner Kebab! But Claudia, an aspiring art director, wants to save it: she puts together a ragtag line-up of comedians for an evening that could change everything. Too bad the biggest obstacle is Maurizio, the gruff unicorn owner of the place.",
