  "overview": "When an Indian Swami gives a lost generation of Americans a new message of love, the Hare Krishna religion is born. But when the Swami dies without finishing his mission, an American Guru tries to seize control of the movement, leading to accusations of racketeering and murder, and investigations by a West Virginia Sheriff's Detective, the LAPD and the FBI. Krishnas: Gurus. Karma. Murder. gives a glimpse into the epic American tale about charismatic personalities that offer divine light, and Krishna devotees who discover their movement has been corrupted by greed, lust for power and vengeance.Â ",
