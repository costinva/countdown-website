  "overview": "For almost twenty years, two men convicted of murder – one on death row, and the other sentenced to life without parole – maintain two very different accounts of what led to the slaying of Barry Van Treese on January 7, 1997, at the Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City. Richard Glossip, a man with no prior felony convictions, has consistently maintained his innocence, insisting that he had no knowledge that anyone planned to kill Van Treese. Justin Sneed, who admitted to killing the victim and whose fingerprints were found in the room, cut a deal for a life sentence instead of risking the death penalty by telling the police that Glossip hired him to do it. Now, with cameras following Glossip's case during what could be the final days of his life. Killing Richard Glossip tells this haunting story – that of a former motel manager sentenced to die for orchestrating a murder that he swears he had nothing to do with.",
