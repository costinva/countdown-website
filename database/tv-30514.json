  "overview": "Jack Black, Dan Harmon and Rob Schrab became pioneers of the do-it-yourself TV movement with Channel 101, a competitive forum for digital shorts founded in 2003. Realizing they could not stand by while the tidal wave of user-generated content threatened to overwhelm the internet, they founded the new Department of Acceptable TV. In Black's words, \"some stuff is just not acceptable\". Acceptable TV builds off the innovations of Channel 101. Each week viewers will see new three-minute episodes of five proposed TV series produced by the Department staff, and one three-minute episode which was voted the best of the website. Viewers will then be able to vote via the web site www.acceptable.tv, for two of the five professionally produced series to return with a new episode. The three with the least votes are cancelled and replaced by three new pilots the following week. All shows - acceptable and unacceptable - will be shown on the website. The best of these shorts could eventually grow to a full series on VH1. Users of the site will be able to do more than vote on their favorite videos. They can join the \"Department\" and rise through the ranks by finding quality entertainment on the web, or by making their own shows, uploading them to the site, and getting the support and votes of other users.",
