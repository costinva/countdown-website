  "overview": "Each episode of Semi-Detached plays out in real time and follows a perennial loser called Stuart as his life goes down the pan in a suburban cul-de-sac. All Stuart wants is a quiet life as a wedding DJ but his family seems to have other ideas. On top of barely coping with a (much younger) partner April and a new born baby, Stuart also has to look out for his jailbird brother Charlie and his promiscuous, drug-taking Dad Willie. Then there's the ex-wife Kate, who lives across the cul-de-sac with their teenage daughter Madonna and Kate's husband Ted who thinks he's better than Stuart because he sells fish to sushi restaurants.",
