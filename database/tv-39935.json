  "overview": "The 90's are called the wild years and a huge ordeal for everyone in Russia. It's a time when a new country with new orders and new heroes was being built on the ruins of the shattered Soviet Union. \"The 1990s\" is an investigative documentary. This publicistic series is about the most important phenomena in the life of the society of that time, about what every viewer of \"TV Center\" channel remembers: the birth of the \"new Russian\" class, privatization, Chechen wars, beauty contests, \"Aum Shinrikyo\", \"Hopor Invest\", criminal wars, contract killings, \"shock therapy\", colorful characters of newly born show business, the biggest scandals of the decade... That was a very interesting time! Each series is a personal story against the backdrop of significant political events, explaining the nature of many contemporary social problems. Each episode features interviews with participants in particular events and other witnesses of the era, unique archival footage, staged footage, and contemporary graphics.",
