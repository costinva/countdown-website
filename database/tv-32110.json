  "overview": "In a haunted Boston hospital called All Souls Hospital, Dr. Mitchell Grace's tries to find out the truth about the hauntings that dated as far back as the civil war. All Souls Hospital's lower levels used to be a mental asylum, and are haunted by ghosts of dead patients. The ghosts notably include Lazarus, an orderly who has been benevolently haunting the hospital since his days working with Dr. Ambrosius after the Civil War.",
