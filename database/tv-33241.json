  "overview": "Since the first rhymes flowed in the parks of the South Bronx, most of rap's major emcees have been African American. Then, in 1985, NYC's Beastie Boys crossed over rap's race divide to great acclaim. Later, in 1999, Marshall \"Eminem\" Mathers did the same, becoming the undisputed King of Rap. But Slim Shady is slowing down, and VH1 is majorly concerned about rap's future. Who will be the next great white emcee of the new millennium? That's the question that will be answered on the new VH1 series, Ego Trip's The (White) Rapper Show.",
