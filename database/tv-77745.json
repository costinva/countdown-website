  "overview": "The story starts with college student Taichi, who comes from a not-so-well-off household and is desperately searching for work. He (literally) stumbles across fellow student Kouhei while on a job hunt, and is incredibly enticed by the delicious bento Kouhei has in hand. However, something seems a bit off about Kouhei and when Taichi consults his friends about it, he gets an answer he really wasn't expecting: Kouhei is severely hearing impaired.",
