  "overview": "Comhrá, one of TG4's most popular series, is a deceptively simple format – a conversation between the host, the award-winning broadcaster Máirtín Tom Sheáinín, and his weekly guest. His particular talent is to put his guest completely at ease – whether the person is a national figure or someone who has lived life far away from the headlines – all are happy to share their innermost feelings or experiences in a quiet conversation with Máirtín.Among this year's guests are a former Northern Ireland Assembly Minister, a Spiritual Advisor in the world-famous seminary in Maynooth, a wandering minstrel from Donegal, a Eurovision Song Contest presenter and the singing entrepreneur who owns one of Cork's best-known hotels.",
