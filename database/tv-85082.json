  "overview": "Mockumentary about the (fictional) Eurodance star Thomas Janowski, alias \"Messiah\", who had his biggest hit in the 1990s. \"XTC\" stormed the charts and made him famous overnight. Oli P. Â is left behind and Sabrina Setlur becomes his girlfriend. But his second song \"Sexy Sex\" was no longer able to build on this ecstasy. The Eurodance messiah was nothing more than a one-hit wonder. Now, 30 years later, Janowski runs his mother Bettina's restaurant in the most desolate area of Berlin-Wedding. But then he receives an offer to be accompanied by a camera crew for a documentary soap. With the support of his manager Leon, Messiah senses a chance for a comeback. At the same time, he faces a reunion with old acquaintances.",
