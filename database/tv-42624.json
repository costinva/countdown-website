  "overview": "Between 2005 and 2009, eight women were murdered in the small town of Jennings, Louisiana. Although they all knew each other and their bodies were discovered in very similar circumstances, local police refuse to link the deaths. While some residents think the murders could be the work of a serial killer, others believe a darker conspiracy is at work and it may even include members of law enforcement. As they wait in vain for the investigation to move forward, the victim's families refuse to give up in their quest for justice. But with the investigation into all 8 deaths still open, police aren't talking, leaving the community haunted by the question: who killed the Jennings 8?",
