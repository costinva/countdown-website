  "overview": "The Gloaming: the twilight space where light meets dark, the space between awake and asleep, where time passes but secrets linger… Unorthodox, troubled cop Molly McGee leads an investigation into the murder of an unidentified woman. To solve the case, Molly has to team up with Alex O'Connell – a man she hasn't spoken to in twenty years – and they discover that the murder has links to a cold case from the past. What begins as a routine investigation exposes something more insidious, and to catch the killer, Molly and Alex have to face the ghosts of their past.",
