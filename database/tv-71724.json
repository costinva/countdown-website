  "overview": "Cute introvert Diewdai likes living in his ultra private world, hiding away in his apartment. His best friend is a turtle called Khun Chai. Diew's life of peace, however, is destroyed when God—an extroverted senior from another faculty—moves in next door. God throws loud parties daily. Diew does his best to endure it—he likes this building—but one night he can't take it any longer. He slams his door shut to let God know he has a neighbor. After having been there a month, God feels bad and—unsure how to apologize—addresses him from the balcony. Diew responds unconcernedly and, going back and forth, the pair's talking turns to friendship, with the caveat that they mustn't meet face-to-face, Diew insists. ",
