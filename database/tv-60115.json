  "overview": "Fastest Finger First offers contestants the one prize money can't buy – a guaranteed place on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire...?' and the opportunity to win a million pounds.Five contestants play against each other to take it in turn to work their way up the question ladder.  The two players with the biggest score at the end of the round go head-to-head in a Fastest Finger First dual. At the end of each episode, whoever is in the seat when the Klaxon sounds has won a place to be fast tracked to sit in the Millionaire hot seat in front of Jeremy Clarkson by-passing the usual Fastest Fingers First round that opens the show.",
