  "overview": "The series focuses on hotel heiress Millie and her best friend Adriana. Together, the two try by any means necessary to keep their beloved princely palace afloat. Each episode of the initially eight-part series chronicles a night shift of the hotel crew until dawn. During this shift, bedless guests are sometimes brought to concierge Charles's reception at 3 a.m., whose very special requests make the team sweat. The hotel bar is an emotional refuge for many of the characters of the night. Bartender Rafael works there, and with his unwavering good humor, he can find something positive in even the most bizarre and darkest night. Head chef Franca, on the other hand, is firmly convinced that a real Hollywood star has checked into the aging, traditional hotel.",
