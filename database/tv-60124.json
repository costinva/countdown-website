  "overview": "Having met with overwhelming success as a regional sales director at Jieke, a major multi-national company poised to claim a lion's share of the Chinese market, Zhou Rui is thrilled when he learns his business acumen has granted him a huge promotion. Transferring to the company's headquarters in Beijing, Zhou Rui is dazzled by the endless opportunities that await him. However, it doesn't take long for him to realize that this glittering new life of his comes at a cost. Deprived of the sales team he personally trained, Zhou Rui has only his most trusted aide, Fang Wei beside him. To make matters worse, Zhou Rui has recently been assigned an impossible task, with an equally impossible deadline. With pressure mounting from his boss, Zhou Rui's only hope of survival lies in landing a huge deal with one of the country's most prestigious banks. Working against the odds, Zhou Rui approaches the bank with a lucrative offer, only to discover that their biggest competitor, Huikang, has been working on a deal with the bank for more than a year. As if to add insult to injury, Zhou Rui soon learns that heading up the opposition's cutthroat team is none other than his first love, Luo Jia. Overwhelmed by impossible odds and distracted by Luo Jia's sudden return to his life, Zhou Rui must find a way to rise above the opposition, if he's ever going to succeed. Will he be able to achieve the impossible, or will this life in the fast lane prove to be too much?",
