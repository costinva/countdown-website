  "overview": "Ace Anderson and Dick Kowalski are two semi-competent cops in San Francisco during the late 1970s. They show more attention towards appearing cool and disco dancing, but finish the cases by the end of the day. They are assisted by their disgruntled police chief Captain Dobbs, plucky reporter Miss Lee, fellow disco lover Boogaloo, and an additional officer called Flora \"Fly\" Ibanez in the second season.",
