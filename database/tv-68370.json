  "overview": "Accomplice to Murder with Vinnie Politan looks beyond the usual suspects to tell the gripping stories of everyday people caught up in a world of deception and manipulation as they become accomplices to murder. Court TV lead anchor Vinnie Politan hosts and travels across the country to speak with the accomplices - the convicted, the condemned as well as the exonerated - who provide a unique window into cases whose verdicts might not be as clear-cut as initially thought.Â ",
