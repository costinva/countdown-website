  "overview": "In Zuidas we are going to visit a number of lawyers at the Amsterdam Zuidas where financial scandals, tangible clients, working through nights and office drinks that are completely out of control are the order of the day. This is how we see Sabia, she graduates as a law student and she does everything she can to get hold of a place at one of the best law firms in the Zuidas, VDSGM. At this advokant office, Van de Sande Grinten Meijer, Sabia faces the founding partners and a major power struggle.",
