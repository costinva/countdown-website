  "overview": "14 people, who have all appeared on television, will take part in an extraordinary adventure for 8 days. The shock promises to be tough and the competition colorful. Every day, they will crisscross towns and villages in Wallonia and will have to unite to overcome their fears, surpass themselves physically and solve the puzzles that will mark their journey. Their objective: to win as many missions as possible in order to collect the greatest number of silver bars. They will be welcomed at the Château de Mielmont by a distinguished guest: Frédéric Etherlinck. The participants are divided into two groups: the Traitors and the Faithful. The former will have the right to eliminate a Faithful each evening and the latter will have to unmask the Traitors because at the end of the competition, only one candidate will be able to leave with the loot.",
