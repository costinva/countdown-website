  "overview": "Wildlife Rescue Australia focuses on the vets and nurses at the Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital as they treat unique Aussie animals. Head Vet Dr. Bree Talbot and her amazing team of vets and nurses are dedicated to triaging and treating a range of animals, including marsupials, birds, reptiles and amphibians brought in each day by wildlife rescue volunteers and community members. From their mobile vet truck, the team is always busy as they deal with everything from a 3-week-old baby puggle echidna who's lost her mum to koalas and kangaroos in need of life saving surgery. This fly on the wall observational series takes the audience on a rollercoaster ride of emotions as the lives of some of these beautiful creatures hang in the balance.",
