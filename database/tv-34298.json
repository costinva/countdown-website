  "overview": "Bad Girls Road Trip follows The Bad Girls Club season one housemates Leslie, Aimee and Zara as they travel cross country to meet each other's friends and family; visit the other bad girls' in their hometowns and help cast the second season of the show. With plenty of unfinished business and unanswered questions from their time living together, drama follows these unapologetic, outrageous women across the country. Stops include cast mate Kerry's country music scene in Nashville, Zara's one-stoplight town in upstate New York and an eventful reunion in Boston with former housemate Rispi, who left the house after a drunken altercation in the first week of season one.",
