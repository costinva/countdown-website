  "overview": "Four modern confectioners step back in time to discover what life was like for their Tudor predecessors. They'll explore how our national sweet tooth developed, and how the tables of the aristocracy boasted fantastic displays of sugar craft which showed off their owners' wealth and status.The Sweet Makers will also explore the negative side of the introduction of sugar to the Tudor lifestyle, including the impact on teeth and fueling our involvement in the most shameful chapters in British history - the Slave trade.",
