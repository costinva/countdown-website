  "overview": "In this five-part special, fans will get a front row seat for all the fun and chaos as Brat and Judy embark on the whirlwind journey of parenthood together. Sharing their most private moments through never-before-seen self-shot footage, social media clips, On-The-Fly interviews, and verité. Each episode is framed around a ‘story book' chapter that they'll narrate for their son so that one day he can look back on the first few months of his life (and hopefully get a good laugh).From changing dirty diapers, to breast pumping and middle of the night wake ups, we'll witness a new side of the couple as they navigate motherhood. How will the added pressure and stress of a baby impact Brat and Judy's relationship and work-life? Will they be able to navigate fame and family with a new baby?",
