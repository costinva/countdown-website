  "overview": "Over the course of more than 30 years that he's been in the limelight, Williams has hit high highs and low lows. The series will follow those ups and downs â€” and the media scrutiny that already dogged Williams throughout his career. From his struggles with addiction to his recovery, his breakup with Take That to their reunion, the documentary will use new interviews and peeks into Williams' 25-year archive to delve deep into the heart and soul of a pop star.",
