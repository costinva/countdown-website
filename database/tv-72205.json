  "overview": "Within the space of five years in the 1990s, six young women went missing in Ireland, never to be seen again. In the same vast area known today as Ireland's Vanishing Triangle, Annie McCarrick, Josephine Dullard, Fiona Pender, Ciara Breen, Fiona Sinnott and Deirdre Jacob all disappeared without a trace. Thirty years on from the first case, the new two-part crime series delves into the investigations prompted by the tragic disappearances of these women and the ongoing search for answers.Featuring interviews with some of the victims' family and friends, former detectives and investigative journalists, this harrowing series examines whether we are any closer to uncovering one of Ireland's darkest secrets.Crime journalist Geraldine Niland is at the heart of the story – taking us through the cases and beyond as she fights for answers for the families still grappling with the devastation of not knowing what happened to their loved ones. As well as an in-depth analysis by Irish forensic scientist David Kenny who reveals a location where, he believes, a body or bodies may be buried – deep in the Wicklow mountains and close to the home of local suspect Larry Murphy.",
