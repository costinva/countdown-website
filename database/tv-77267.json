  "overview": "If one day, someone tells you that he is your lover from the multiverse, would you believe it? To Phukan, love feels out of reach until one day, the popular senior Cirrus, a perfectly accomplished man, stepped forward and said, 'We are lovers\". How could Phukan believe it, when neither of them have ever met before? Even though doubts arose, P'Cir seemed to know everything about his life, until Phukan's heart gradually began to lean towards him. Moreover, Cirrus claimed that if they hadn't known each other, he would have asked for the chance to start over again. Phukan's heart eventually softened and melted. \"I like him and he is just my type, but there's one problem. He's my lover in the multiverse.\" Phukan has to decide whether to let his lover go or keep him for himself. ",
