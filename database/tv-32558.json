  "overview": "Four challengers compete in the White Room Studio hoping to walk away as the contest's best designer and winner of $10,000. They are tasked with transforming their empty spaces using only Hershey's candy and merchandise - in under 15 hours. During this special competition, not only are challengers battling to design a room of their client's dreams, but the clients themselves can win $5,000.",
