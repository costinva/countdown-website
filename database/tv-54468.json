  "overview": "Set in the heart of Hampshire, Alan Titchmarsh will be celebrating the great outdoors and the joy of getting back into the fresh air and our green and pleasant land. With the warmer months on the horizon and lockdown soon to be lifted the series will focus on our beautiful countryside, nature and being able, once again, to take advantage of our outdoor spaces, no matter how big or small. From farming and animal life to what, where and when to plant for the coming year, from countryside pursuits to tips on how to get the most from our outside space, we delve into all things seasonally British as we leave winter behind and head into spring and summer. Each week Alan will be chatting to a celebrity guest as well as getting them involved in some of the planting, nature features and food tastings.",
