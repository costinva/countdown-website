  "overview": "Frustrated friends, reluctant relatives and nosy neighbors tell hosts Amy Devers and Alan Luxmore about an eyesore in need of a curb-appeal makeover. With just one weekend to finish the job, Amy and Alan tackle everything from the cracked driveway to the collapsed fence, the porch with peeling paint and the overgrown path to the front door. Despite being challenged by extreme vegetation, inclement weather, and often reluctant property owners, Amy and Alan teach homeowners practical and easy ways to update and maintain their yards.",
