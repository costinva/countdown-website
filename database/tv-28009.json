  "overview": "Wildlife filmmaker Johnny Kingdom wants to develop a wildlife haven on his beloved Exmoor. But where to start? In each programme, through the seasons, Johnny heads off to a different part of the country - either to find out more about an animal that he knows is already on his land, like badgers and wild boar, or because he'd like to see if he can attract new wildlife to it, like hares and dormice. It's a dream come true for Johnny and a massive project, but one he's determined to see through to the end.",
