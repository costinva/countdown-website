  "overview": "Beyond the statesman, who was de Gaulle? What was the driving force and the spring of the man who devoted himself to his country? What role did his discreet wife Yvonne and his daughter Anne play, which gave him the strength to hold out in his great moments of doubt? This film makes us relive the brilliance of the illustrious pages of French history and lifts the veil on the secret of a personality modestly hidden behind the hero's statue.",
