  "overview": "A band of fantastic losers encounters monsters that come out of television due to engineered VHS videotapes. Then these buddies decide to gather in a group, the Pixhunters, aiming at fighting the eyesore. Each of them is dressed up as a bear or modern knight or super hero or Rambo/Karate Kid. Bloody School Girl, a ruthless killer who was the first to arise from a TV set, decides to mobilize the monsters using their respective tapes so that she could rule the world. The Pixhunters will join forces with other characters to fight her. So the battle for tapes gets started.",
