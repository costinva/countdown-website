The happenings from the hoaxes? The facts from the fiction? This series will see Charlie search spooky small-town goings on, uncovering eye-witness accounts and elusive evidence as well as staging his own experiments in a bid to bring him closer to the truth. Along the way, he will pay homage to the countryside legends of brilliant Britain and will explore how they have come to define the places and people they originate from.",
