  "overview": "In the small community in Tornedalen, the people go and wait for the highlight of the summer, Övertorneå Cruising. We follow the zealots behind the arrangement, their lives and friendships in a motor club where tired parents of small children and hardcore raggers unite in a passion for cars, community and a boundless love for their hometown.",
