But when an accidental mixup lands her in a sibling contract with Gu Yan Xi, the young master of the well-known Gu family, her simple life is flipped upside down. Now obligated to play the part of Gu Yan Xi's younger sister, Xiao Wan finds herself tangled in the affairs of one of the most prominent business families in the land.

As her head tells her to go one way, her heart tells her to go another; leaving Xiao Wan to wonder, which brother will ultimately help her find the happiness she desires?",
