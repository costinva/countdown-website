  "overview": "Vast, sparse, hot and pockmarked with abandoned mineshafts - the Western Australian Goldfields desert can swallow you whole. Murder in the Goldfields investigates three baffling murders that have defied homicide detectives despite a rising amount of evidence.Ray and Jennie Kehlet went prospecting with another man but never came back, Lisa Goven left a trail of evidence via CCTV cameras but disappeared, and Charlie Park vanished into thin air. It's time we asked just why the Kalgoorlie Goldfields have more than its fair share of unsolved murders.",
