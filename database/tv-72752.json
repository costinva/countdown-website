  "overview": "Adaptation of Miguel Torga's iconic short stories. An intimate look at a rural community in the 1940s. Each chapter has its own protagonist, whose existence is untouched by modernity or the outside world. Five portraits of humble lives with enormous resistance to suffering - and a capacity for violence that, at times, proves impossible to repress.",
