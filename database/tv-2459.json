  "overview": "With roadside diners, vintage drive-ins and out-of-the-way \"dives\" enjoying a resurgence of hipness among foodies, host Guy Fieri travels across America in search of some of the best \"greasy spoon\" eateries. The restaurants that Guy visits are usually well-known among locals and other people in the region. While at each location, Fieri talks to the staff as well as the customers to get their thoughts on the food. Many episodes feature eateries that are connected by a common thread, such as burgers or comfort foods but its all here on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.",
