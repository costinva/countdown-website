  "overview": "After watching her life slip into a downward spiral of drug addiction ending with an attempted suicide, Hannah Miller turned herself around and started a new life as a minister. At the same time, she still must care for her two kids, a young son who has embraced his mother's new life cheerfully, and declared agnostic daughter who has not. Additional complications come from her church's Deacon Sutherland, who opposed Miller's hiring.",
