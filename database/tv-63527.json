  "overview": "A way to learn more about the habits and customs of this French Autonomous Territory at the end of the world. In short, five families compete on Tahiti's sister island, Moorea. It's a real competition that combines both sporting and intellectual challenges based on local legends. The performance of parents and children have an impact on each other and are complementary. Each week, a family is eliminated. Only one family will remain, who will win a cruise of several weeks in French Polynesia.",
