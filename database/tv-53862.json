  "overview": "Abla Fahita is an Egyptian satirical puppet character. The character was introduced in 2010 online, she featured in Al Bernameg with Bassem Youssef, and has started a show in 2014 Abla Fahita Live from the Duplex on CBC channel. The infamous widow with her sharp tongue and acid humour and an obvious defiance for taboos has gained her both lovers and haters.
