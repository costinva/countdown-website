  "overview": "Мужская тема is a symbiosis of talk shows and modern podcasts, where male celebrities answer questions that concern people in the XXI century. Bright representatives of show business, theater, pop, cinema, sports, as well as Internet stars meet in the barbershop. Here, on male territory, they can openly discuss a variety of topics, sometimes seriously, and sometimes with humor. This is a chance to see the idol in a confidential communication without notes, compare his opinion with your own and hear what men really talk about when there is not a single girl around.",
