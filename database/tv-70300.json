  "overview": "Weighing in on all rights protected by the Constitution, the nine unelected Justices of the Supreme Court have the final word on issues that impact our democracy and daily lives, including the right to privacy and access to the ballot. Deadlocked premieres at a profoundly consequential time, as Americans grapple with a Supreme Court drastically remade by former President Donald Trump; the historic confirmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson; the unprecedented leak from inside the Court's chambers; and the aftershock of the landmark Dobbs decision's effective reversal of Roe v. Wade. To understand this critical moment, the series travels back to the 1950s when Chief Justice Earl Warren heralded an era of progressive legal decisions spurred by the nation's changing values, paving the zigzagging path the country is still walking today. Deadlocked reveals how the Supreme Court's ideological balance has shifted over the years to reflect the hopes – and fears – of American citizens, exploring the interconnectedness between the Court's and the nation's future.",
