  "overview": "Everyone's favourite tour guide Brendan Sheerin is back, but this time he's leaving behind the sunny sites of Europe and taking the coach on its most ghoulish adventure yet – on a Celebrity Ghost Trip.Instead of topping up their tans, our celebs will be wrapping up warm as they experience some truly scary activities from ghost hunting through to spine tingling overnight stays as well as the odd creepy forfeit.In true Coach Trip tradition, one thing remains the same – Brendan is armed with his yellow and red cards. Each night, the celebrities will vote for who they least enjoy traveling with. Get two yellows and they're kicked off to be replaced by new famous faces.",
