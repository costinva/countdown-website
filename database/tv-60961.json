  "overview": "Munya and Filly Get Chilly is the spin-off show to Freeze the Fear with Wim Hof. In each episode, presenters and viral comedy stars, Munya and Filly will immerse themselves in the sub-zero temperatures and take on Wim's challenges, from breathing exercises to ice baths and beyond. They'll have the chance to collaborate musically with Wim (who loves a singsong) and they have lots of pranks for each other and the celebs in store.",
