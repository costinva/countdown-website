  "overview": "Comical entertainment show, hosted by Jack Spijkerman, in which comedians Ruben van der Meer and Tijl Beckand face each other in convincing the studio audience. Under the guidance of Jack, Tijl and Ruben are presented in various rounds with questions, humorous statements and trivial issues, a number of which also come from viewers. To these and other gnawing questions, Tijl and Ruben each formulate their own answer and bring it so passionately and convincingly that both arguments seem equally likely. But only one story is \"Really?!\". Everything is used to fool the hundred people in the audience and Tijl and Ruben take turns trying to play the hundred audience members away. For the people who manage to stay, â‚¬10,000 is ready to distribute.",
