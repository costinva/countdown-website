After the death of his older brother, he inherited his debts, so he has been living with his parents, wife and two children in his mother-in-law's house for a long time. But trouble does not come alone. The local government is going to put radioactive waste for storage in the mine, in which the body of grandfather Teymuraz tragically died and rests. Several attempts to reach the authorities and stop the approaching catastrophe do not lead to success.
