  "overview": "Three former Farmen participants have settled down at the cemetery Torpet to seek revans. Again, all the participants who lose the two-battle camps will come to the Farmer to get a new opportunity to fight back on the Farmer again. But there's only room for three in Torpet. Therefore, the one who comes from the Farmer must meet one of those living at the Torpet in a competition.",
