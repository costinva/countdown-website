Anong is a high-society lady whom many men compete for, given her status, it's important that her family finds her a good match. Passionate lawyer Wichai finds himself randomly tasked with screening potential husbands for her. His duty is to eliminate unsuitable candidates and pave the way for his younger brother. However, Wichai redefines what it means to be worthy, leading Anong to realize that no one is more suitable than Wichai himself. He only sees her, however, as a sister-in-law. Anong attempts to win his heart, even if there's only a \"one in a hundred\" chance that a confident woman such as she could land a saint like him.~~ Adapted from the novel \"Nueng Nai Roi\" (หนึ่งในร้อย) by Dok Mai Sod (ดอกไม้สด).",
