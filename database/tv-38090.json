  "overview": "Married couple June and Oscar live a comfortable but predictable life in suburban California. For years they've had the same conversations, eaten the same meals and taken pleasant vacations at the same rented lake house. But after June talks Oscar into shaking things up with a ski trip, the pair suddenly find themselves in completely unfamiliar territory.",
