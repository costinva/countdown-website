  "overview": "This story takes place on New Year's Eve, 1996, when sisters Júlia and Raquel are out to celebrate with a group of friends. While Júlia doesn't drink all night due to her pregancy, her sister spends every minute doing so. On their way back home, Raquel runs over a man crossing the street and, in an act of desperation, flees from the scene, with Júlia chasing after her, insisting that they should stay to help the man.Meanwhile, the police arrives and Júlia ends up taking the blame by saying that she was the one who was driving when they hit the man. She didn't expect, however, that he would eventually die in hospital, turning the case into a hit and run. Júlia is sentenced to 18 years in prison for aggravated murder and gives birth to her daughter Mariana in jail, handing her over to Raquel to raise her until she gets out. She also asks Raquel to never tell her daughter that she's in prison, instead that she's traveling around the world.",
