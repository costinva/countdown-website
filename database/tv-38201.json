  "overview": "Snakes in your sewage, albino animals, panthers as pets. These rare and bizarre scenarios may sound like punch lines, but this is no laughing matter. It's serious science, and we've got the pictures to prove it!From an entire elementary school being taken over by monkeys to a deer with two tails and six legs, each episode of Weird True and Freaky tackles a true-life, truly weird animal story. Animal Planet delivers in-depth analysis of the footage and fresh insight from scholars, including Stanford University animal experts Dr. Jill Helms and Dr. Sophia Yin, exotic animal specialist Dave Riherd, and snake wrangler Jason C. McElroy. Surprising, startling, sensational and 100 percent real.",
