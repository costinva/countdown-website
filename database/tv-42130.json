  "overview": "After being named CEO of the world's largest and most non-sensical corporation, Sebben &amp; Sebben, Judy Ken Sebben (aka Birdgirl) has to find a way to maintain her work/superhero life balance. Through the halls of the company headquarters she assembles her Birdteam! By day, they try to drag the company into this century. By... mid-afternoon, they usually end up having to break a lot of things to stop something bad that one of them may have helped cause. It's the sort of superhero team we get at this moment.",
