  "overview": "There are certain places in the world that hold special meaning to us all, whether it invokes nostalgia, a sense of heritage or it is simply the beauty of an environment that makes its mark on us forever. These are the places that need to be protected, understood and savored so that we are not the only ones to enjoy them with such intensity - they need to be preserved for future generations. Born of that notion, VICELAND, in partnership with Live Nation and Subaru of America, Inc., presents Earthworks.",
