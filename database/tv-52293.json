  "overview": "Erik and Lenny, two men in dire straits, stumble upon a WW2 resistance cellar in the Ardennes. The cellar has weapons, counterfeiting tools and a few bottles of wine. The men see a great opportunity for a swindle. They persuade a Brussels antiquarian that the wine is the Führer's and forge a letter to prove it. They hope to make a ton of cash but the interested parties are more numerous and shadowy than expected. When arts expert Judith and gangster moll Rosy want their share, the swindle gets wildly out of hand. ",
