  "overview": "Twins Sol and Sun are almost as different as night from day, but one thing they have in common is their mutual love for Piano, a girl who moved into the neighborhood when they were all kids and who they've been besties with ever since. They also share a dream of making it big in the music industry and together they barely manage to get into the Plus Artist Academy contest that's on the hunt for new Thai talent. A twist of fate, however, smashes their dreams, and turns Sun and Piano against Sol who got hired to be a member of a new Thai boy band by the Empire agency. But all isn't as it seems. Can the friends reconcile or is it too late to forgive when so much hurt has happened?",
