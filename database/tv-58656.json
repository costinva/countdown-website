  "overview": "El Rostro de la Venganza is the story of Diego Mercader, the \"monster boy\" unjustly sentenced to 20 years in prison. With the help of Antonia Villarroel, he manages to prove that he suffered from temporary dementia and is no longer a danger to society. A millionaire frees him, adopts him and gives him a new identity: Martín Méndez, son of Hugo Méndez and María Mesa. Despite this being the best way to protect himself from the press and the dangers that the 1992 massacre brings, his past still haunts him, and he can't live freely.",
