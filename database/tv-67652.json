  "overview": "Eight celebrities are stepping into the unknown for a reality competition where their senses are taken on the ultimate journey by entering a completely pitch-black reality space for eight days.Scared of the Dark follows the celebs who are living in The Bunker, a purpose-built living space designed to block out any light and rigged with 50 infrared cameras. Â Over five successive nights the show will follow the celebrities as they get to grips with living in the dark. To leave The Bunker the celebrities must simply shout \"I'm Scared of The Dark\" and they are escorted into the light.To prove their mettle, each of the celebrities will take on a series of challenges designed to test either their primal fear of total darkness or their ability to function in the pitch black. Those that fail at their challenges will have to take on herculean tasks to save their place on the show. Each celebrity will be motivated to conquer their fears because at the end only one will step out into the light as series winner.",
