  "overview": "Iain Sterling's CelebAbility is a physical comedy entertainment show hosted by comedian Iain Sterling. Each episode features a group of 5 friends who go head to head with 5 celebrities in a series of hilarious rounds. All the rounds are based on the unusual skill or ability that the celebrities believe they naturally possess.All the games build up to a final prize winning game in which the remaining friends must answer questions about the remaining celebrities. Fewer celebrities mean fewer possible answers so the greater the chance of winning and the more questions answered correctly means the greater the cash prize!",
