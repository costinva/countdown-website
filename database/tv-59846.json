  "overview": "Twisted Killers tells the shocking stories of some of America's darkest, most unusual murderers. Along the way, a trio of criminal experts, including former NYC DA Beth Karas, retired LAPD Homicide Detective Tracey Benjamin, and forensic psychologist Kate Termini, provide insight and expertise on how these twisted killers were brought to justice. Murderers featured in the show include a man who pretended to be a lost driver before repeatedly stabbing people and watching them walk away, a killer who strangled his victims and posed them in odd ways, a sniper who seemingly picked victims at random, a predator who drained a woman of blood, and more.",
