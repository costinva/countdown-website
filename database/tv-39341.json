  "overview": "First Class All the Way brings viewers into a world where champagne wishes and caviar dreams are reality. Billionaires, socialites and entertainment moguls turn to Duffy and her team of travel experts to scour the world in search of the best, most one-of-a-kind experiences. Outrageous demands from their clients are nothing out of the ordinary as her team ensures that there is no mission too great, no corner of the world too remote, and no experience too immense. From private yachts, million dollar villas, and exclusive resorts Duffy and her team make the dreams of the rich and famous come true. This season viewers will get a first class look as Duffy sends five wealthy housewives to Monte Carlo for a private tour of the Monaco Royal Families art collection and a meeting with Prince Albert, a romantic getaway to the Amalfi Coast in Italy for actor Sam Page and his long-time girlfriend, a private wine tasting tour in Napa Valley and the ultimate guys vacation for star Leonard Roberts and his friends to a private villa in Tuscany.",
