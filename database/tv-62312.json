  "overview": "1990 - Walter, nicknamed \"W\", Ben and Nik, three 17-year-old nerds from provincial West Germany, are certain: \"Nothing works for us.\" Until a Chevy carrying black GIs from the nearby U.S. base turns the corner and a hip-hop beat booming from the speakers changes their lives forever. The three of them only want one thing: to rap. Because their school English is not good enough for brilliant rhymes, they end up in German rap in a roundabout way and thus find their own language. While they confront outdated traditions and long-kept family secrets, they come closer not only to themselves, but also to the big stage piece by piece.",
