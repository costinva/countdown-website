  "overview": "In this series, celebrated chef Michel Roux takes us on a culinary adventure through the South of France to create the simple French food he loves to eat when he's relaxing on holiday. Following Michel to the rural retreat in the Ardeche where he escapes each summer, he will share how he likes to cook simple French country cooking from home. From a bicycle ride to a local village boulangerie, to sharing wines and memories at his local wine cave, this is an atmospheric slice of Michel's southern summer getaway. Michel will share no-nonsense recipes for simple snacks, stunning desserts, light lunches to be enjoyed in the sun, and satisfying main courses. A rich beef stew, a stunning salad of goat's cheese, toasted walnuts and honey or delicious melon granita, Michel will turn simple ingredients into tasty recipes for table or terrace.",
