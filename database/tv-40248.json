  "overview": "In a small, hand-built shop in a rural town lives a car artist like no other: Chad Hiltz aka \"Bad Chad\". His one-of-a-kind creations spring from his imagination, a mind that never stops. Isolated and without extra spending money, Chad always had to be creative and resourceful. Using only basic tools and his limitless ingenuity, Chad will incorporate literally anything into his car builds, parts from a boat, airplane, even an old locker. Part MacGyver, part Willy Wonka, if Bad Chad can imagine it, he will find a way to build it. Bad Chad Customs chronicles this master builder and his tight-knit team who turn metal from the junkyards into award-winning cars.",
