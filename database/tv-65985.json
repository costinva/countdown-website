  "overview": "Chelsea Stevens is a one-woman cooking, decorating and entertaining machine who thinks every crisis can be solved by a decorative centerpiece. As America's reigning queen of domesticity, style, and gracious living, she has created a media empire consisting of magazines, video, and television spots. Enter small-town girl Jane Sokol, who has been brought to the Big Apple to manage Chelsea's business after she sells it to Ferber Enterprises. Level-headed Jane goes head to head with neurotic control-freak Chelsea in her daily attempts to handle budgets and Chelsea's difficult staff -- not to mention Chelsea's meddling interference in her life.Â ",
