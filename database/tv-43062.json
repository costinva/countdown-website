  "overview": "The legendary feats of strongmen have been celebrated throughout time, but just how true are these fabled acts? After years of competing as rivals the four strongest men in the world are teaming up to find out. Eddie Hall, Brian Shaw, Nick Best and Robert Oberst travel the world investigating strongman legends and taking on epic feats of strength, in a quest to prove who really is The Strongest Man in History. In each episode the four strongmen take on three strength challenges from history and try to beat the legend - and each other. They separate fact from fiction - replicating legendary lifts to determine what they actually weighed, while competing to see who among them is the strongest.",
