  "overview": "Franck Sharko (45) is a gruff and lonely cop. Unable to mourn his daughter, he has visions of her: Eugenie interferes everywhere. Especially in his new investigation in which children mysteriously disappear while an old film from the 60s provokes strange and dangerous behavior in those who watch it.Lucie Henebelle is 35 years old. She too is a cop, a single mother. When she realizes that her past may be related to Sharko's investigation, she joins his team. The meeting of the two police officers therefore promises to be electric... But this investigation will above all lead them from Morocco to Canada to shed light on troubled scientific experiments.",
