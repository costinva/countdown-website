  "overview": "Las Vegas is growing in population at an extremely high rate. The police force is not. There are many hotels and temporary residences that are available for rent or lease that ask no questions. As a result, Las Vegas is a very popular destination for fugitives. This is a reality show based in Las Vegas that shows criminals being arrested by 3 different law enforcement entities: the US Marshals, SWAT and Bounty Hunters.",
