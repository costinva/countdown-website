  "overview": "In a busy corner of Ben's bedroom lies a well-thumbed, well cherished pop-up book. This is no ordinary pop-up book... this is where the Abadas live! Hari the hippo, Ela the fox and Seren the bat are the most curious, adventurous and funniest pop-up animals that any book could possibly have. Once the book is opened, the Abadas' world comes alive and it's playtime for the three adventurers.",
