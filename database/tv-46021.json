  "overview": "This series, telling about the three hundred year history of the Romanov dynasty in Russia, is designed for the widest audience. It may interest all those who care about the past of their country. At the same time, the time frame for the events described is somewhat wider than the time of the Romanov dynasty itself. The authors of the series tried to tell the audience a three-hundred-year-old story in a popular and lively, \"family-like\" way, without archival dust. And this was not easy, given the fact that the features and problems of state building were touched upon over the course of 4 centuries. This is probably why the story of the Romanov dynasty is told in the film by representatives of another dynasty, Smirnovs: father, Andrei Smirnov, creator of the legendary Belorussky Train Station, and his son, budding director Alexey. Experts from the series were famous historians Andrei Bogdanov, Dmitry Oleinikov, Evgeny Anisimov, Igor Zimin, Alexander Muzafarov, Alexander Bokhanov, Sergey Mironenko, writers Alexei Varlamov, Nina Sorotokina and others.",
