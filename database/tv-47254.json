  "overview": "Prop Culture is an anthology series that takes a unique look at beloved films through the props &amp; costumes (now modern ‘artifacts') that made them unique – from the craftspeople who created them, the actors who interacted with them, and the collectors / archives who own and cherish them. The show will be hosted by film historian/collector Dan Lanigan. Among the films featured in the first eight episodes are \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" \"Mary Poppins,\" \"The Muppet Movie,\" \"Tron\" and \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\".",
