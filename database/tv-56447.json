  "overview": "Peacock's Dr. Death: The Undoctored Story will offer audiences the chance to hear and see the whole story, told by the real people who survived it. In addition to interviews with the real-life Dr. Robert Henderson, Dr. Randall Kirby and Michelle Shughart (played by Alec Baldwin, Christian Slater and AnnaSophia Robb, respectively, in the scripted series), the docuseries will feature new conversations with others closest to Duntsch and his criminal case including Jerry Summers, Duntsch's best friend who he paralyzed following two surgeries; Wendy Young, the ex-girlfriend of Duntsch and mother to his two sons; Dr. Joy Gathe-Ghermay, the anesthesiologist during Jerry Summer's horrific surgery; Dr. Mark Hoyle, a Texas surgeon who physically tried to stop Duntsch during a surgery; Tex Muse and Pamela Trusty, two of Duntsch's victims; and lawyers from the trial.",
