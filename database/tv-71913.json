  "overview": "Homicide detective Tess Avery is forced to quit the job she loves after nearly killing her partner and being diagnosed as clinically blind. Reluctant to accept help, Tess uses an assistance app and connects with Sunny Patel, a professional seeing-eye guide and agoraphobe living 3,000 miles away. Haunted by the unsolved cases she left behind, Tess uses a hidden camera and earpiece, while Sunny remotely steers Tess through life's obstacles -- and crimes -- as the two challenge preconceptions about ability, trust and where to draw the line.",
