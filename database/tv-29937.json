  "overview": "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth… The Alpha and Omega left a pattern of His fingerprints across each corner of the universe, found even in the tiniest crevices of our planet. A pattern that David Rives has devoted his life to finding and sharing… often defying the conventions of modern science. In a culture of those who make sweeping statements, point fingers, or avoid controversy altogether, David has made bold assertions and fortified them through empirical research from the Earth to the furthest corners of heaven. With a unique combination of creation, Biblical astronomy and archaeology, David has built a solid case for our Creator and Savior, Jesus Christ–and the world is taking notice. Just as the heavens declare the glory of God, David Rives is proclaiming the manifest presence of God throughout the universe, throughout our world and most especially in the hearts of those who know Him.",
