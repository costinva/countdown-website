  "overview": "The story of two friends — employees of the investigation department of high-profile crimes of the Investigative Committee. The authoritarian, bright Irina Makarova, the \"self-made woman\" of post—Balzac age and the quiet, painfully withdrawn, very young general's daughter of Dean Voloshin - they were entrusted with a joint investigation into the murder of women with special cruelty. Ritual murders take place in different parts of the city — obviously, it was done by one person, a complete psychopath. They will catch him because they are \"abnormal bitches\" themselves, according to representatives of the male part of the department staff.",
