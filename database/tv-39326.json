  "overview": "Do you dream of a beautiful place where you can find peace and harmony? A place where you live close to nature? Then you are not alone. The cabin dream is shared by very many, and over 100,000 Norwegians are planning concrete plans to buy a resort over the next three years. In the series Eventyrlig Oppussing, interior expert Halvor Bakke and his carpentry team take you to the mountains, sea and forests. There will be stray trips with freight challenges and sleeping in tents and you will see how they transform a mediocre resort into a gem in the midst of wild and beautiful scenery. Look up an exotic and rugged refurbishment program that inspires, motivates and entertains.",
