  "overview": "Seven's brand-new competition renovation series Dream Home is set to take the renovation genre to new heights as six pairs of everyday Aussies battle it out room by room, transforming tired suburban family homes into astonishing new dream homes.Dream Home is hosted by Dr Chris Brown and will feature some of the biggest and best life-changing renovations Australia has ever seen.\"In real estate terms, my own skills are a renovator's delight, in need of a serious makeover,\" confesses Dr Chris. \"I've somehow lived through two renovations and seen both of them blow out on time and budget; mostly because of my questionable decisions.\" \"I genuinely feel like I can relate to what our couples are experiencing - possibly more than they'll ever know.\"With grit and determination at the forefront, the teams will design and rebuild each other's outdated and dilapidated homes.Following renovations in each state, the top three placing couples will have their backyards completely made over with stunning gardens and outdoor living spaces.All couples will receive the gift of a lifetime with their newly renovated homes. The winning couple will also receive a cash prize of $100,000 to help with their mortgage.A trio of expert judges – Lana Taylor of Three Birds Renovations, top buyer's agent Simon Cohen and award-winning interior designer Rosie Morley – will provide invaluable insight during the renovations before critiquing and scoring each new space in the stunning homes.",
