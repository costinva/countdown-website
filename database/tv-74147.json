  "overview": "\"Saints\" is a travel show in which a young Orthodox blogger will try to repeat the exploits of Seraphim of Sarov, Nil of Sor, Ksenia of St. Petersburg and other saints. Host Seraphim Sashliev will have to go through many tests, from hand-feeding a bear to cutting his head bald. The goal of the project is to find recipes for a fulfilling life today in the exploits of the Saints.This project is about people who managed to become better themselves. The discovery of God inspired them to develop useful qualities in themselves, and allowed them to live in joy and resilience to what was happening around them. Each issue features permanent experts - a psychologist and a priest.",
