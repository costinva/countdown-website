  "overview": "Do luxury ingredients always make the best dishes? Or can humble items be transformed into a recipe for success? Hosted by chef and restaurateur Jordan Andino, Cook at All Costs is a cooking competition where skill meets strategy, as three home cooks put their money where their mouths are to bid on ingredients in a high-stakes, auction-packed cook off. With $25,000 in their banks, the home cooks will have to decide if they want to bid big for the best ingredients, save their money for the basics, or gamble on a surprise â€“ because in the end, the cook who best impresses our celebrity guest chef will win all the money left in their bank. Can the THRIFTY dish topple the PRICEY plate, or will the WILDCARD wow the guest judge for the win? This is Cook at All Costs!",
