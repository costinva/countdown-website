  "overview": "\"You can't pick your own relatives\" goes the old saying, but that's exactly what a lonely hair dresser named Ginger-Nell Hollyhock did. Placing classified ads in local papers, she recruited a con-man husband (Fast Eddie), a tap dancing daughter (Anna Maries), a son who wanted to fly like a bird (Junior) and a tottering old grandfather (Grandpa), all whom came to live together-for the laughs.",
