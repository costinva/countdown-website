Now, something greater poses a threat for the Earth, and it's name is Duo. A mysterious net navi from space, his mission is to erase planets that are living with darkness. Because of the constant evil lurking from Regal's Dark Chips, Duo is set out to destroy Earth. But can Netto and Rockman prove to him that Earth is full of good? Slur, Duo's partner, sends Asteroid Navis (navis with the ability to appear in the real world, at any time, with an included Dimensional Chip) to certain people, to test their morality against Netto and Rockman.
