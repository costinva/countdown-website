  "overview": "The series, based on the stories of Elena Fort√∫n, reflects the adventures of Celia, a seven-year-old girl belonging to Madrid's upper bourgeoisie at the beginning of the 20th century. Celia questions the identity of the Three Wise Men, she is surprised that grown-ups are so boring and follows a code of behavior that is far removed from that of adults, but also far removed from that of the children who share her adventures with her. Celia's spontaneity and determination won over audiences at the time and she became as popular a character as any television hero today.",
