  "overview": "We've come a long way from remote control TV, electric garage doors and in-home intercom systems. The latest technological advances are occurring right under our feet and all around us in homes that are increasingly interconnected, where downloadable smartphone apps bring convenience, efficiency and security to us in ways we could have never imagined. Host Tanya Memme explores the most awesome, state-of-the-art, smart houses on planet Earth. The `wow' factor of these homes is way over the top â€“ from A-list mansions with security systems that can recognize your face from down the block to heated backyards that allow you to swim outside while it's snowing, this series highlights experimental tech havens that would look right at home in The Jetsons.",
