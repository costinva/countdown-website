  "overview": "Did you know that four out of five American women today say they are dissatisfied with their bodies? To help change their perception, Lifetime Television has crossed the Atlantic and brought Britain's hit reality series, How to Look Good Naked to the States. Hosted by Carson Kressley (\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\"), the show teaches women of all shapes and sizes how to go from self-loathing to self-loving without resorting to interventions like extreme dieting or cosmetic surgery.",
