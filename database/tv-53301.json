  "overview": "Paul, a young VTC driver who is lazy, pretentious, not very smart and leaning slightly on the bottle, welcomes in his vehicle people and personalities of all kinds. Never running out of ideas to converse with his customers and talk of everything but especially nothing, our driver inevitably messes things up. For example, he will not recognize certain personalities or confuse them with others. Funny and quirky situations for the best, and especially for laughter.",
