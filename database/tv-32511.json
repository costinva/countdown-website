  "overview": "Step inside Sarah's life with husband Alex and co-conspirator Tommy, as they attempt to build an off the grid dream home from the ground up for her most important client ever: her family. With unparalleled access to the \"behind the scenes\" Sarah, the stakes couldn't be higher as she takes on her biggest challenge yet. With guest appearances from Mike Holmes Sr. and Jr., it's a race of time and money to complete the build on schedule on a remote piece of property while Sarah juggles the demands of running a design business in Toronto and raising two kids.",
