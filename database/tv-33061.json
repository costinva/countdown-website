  "overview": "PokerFace is a British game show, where one person is guaranteed to win Â£1 million. As implied by the title, PokerFace, is based on the bluffing aspect of poker games. The contestants do not necessarily need to get the questions right in order to win, and can bluff their way through the game and pressure their opponents into folding in order to win.",
