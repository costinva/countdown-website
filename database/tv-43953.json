  "overview": "The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes follows Holes as he dives into unsolved homicides by analyzing the physical and emotional \"DNA\" left behind during the violent interaction. With unprecedented access to crime scene photographs, case files and evidence, Holes investigates each crime utilizing his unique forensic and behavioral skillset. Hoping to zero in on the profile of the perpetrator, he lends his expertise in the latest technological advancements from familial and genetic genealogy to latent fingerprint and DNA phenotyping, the process of predicting physical appearance from DNA. Holes travels around the country working with local investigators and experts including Loni Coombs, Yolanda McClary and Laura Richards, to explore new theories, potential suspects and evidence in the hopes of getting one step closer to solving these cases.",
