  "overview": "The Maghreb countries of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are united by great geographic and cultural diversity. From the salt lake Chott El Djerid in southern Tunisia to the enchanted mountains and deserts of Algeria to the surfer's paradise of Imsouane on Morocco's Atlantic coast, the series shows impressive landscapes, but also life in the countryside and in the cities.",
