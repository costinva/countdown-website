  "overview": "Deep Night Club is a host club that is famous for its acrobatic shows, which are different from other bars. It is owned by Madame ‘Freya'. She is the mother of ‘Khemthit', who will take care of business after Freya's retirement. Khemthit doesn't like this bar, but when he meets ‘Vela', a university colleague and also a top host here, he's fascinated and wants to open his heart to him and this profession. Nevertheless, because of social status differences, this love story is not easy, and both of them need to prove this belief altogether. Still, Madame Freya can't open her heart to accept that her son falls in love with her employee and has ‘Meiji', her best friend, besides her to go through difficult times. Khemthit must prove both his mother and Vela, and he has to start working from the lowest position.",
