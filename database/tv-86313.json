  "overview": "In this road series, two friends set off on motorbikes through the coastal countries of Africa from Morocco towards South Africa. The journey to Iraq was a kind of test of whether Martin Písařík could handle his first journey on a motorbike beyond the borders of the Czech Republic. The beginner is tested on the route from Turkey to Iraq by experienced and respected traveller Igor Brezovar. Then a long ride to Africa awaited them both... Igor, a Slovenian, has been living in the Czech Republic for years, he is a person who is friendly towards all the people he meets. And so, thanks to his immediacy, both travellers get to the homes of local residents, where they can see into their family life, as well as exceptional events, celebrations or tribal rituals. Actor Martin Písařík is also an adventurer at heart, but a novice motorcyclist, who bravely copes with the often difficult terrain or the vagaries of the motorbike.",
