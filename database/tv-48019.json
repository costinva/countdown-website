  "overview": "At the center of Nachtschwestern are the nurses from a Cologne emergency room who deal with the stressful service with heart and skill. Everything that happens at night ends up with them: traffic accidents, drunken teenagers, victims of bar fights and sometimes even embarrassing sex accidents. After 15 years, Ella (Ines Kurenbach) returns to night duty. She knows that her former best friend Nora (Mimi Fiedler) now heads the station and has every reason to hate Ella. But you have no choice. She is newly separated and has to feed her three children.",
