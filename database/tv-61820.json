  "overview": "There is no shortage of mysteries in the beautiful environment of Vysočina. A team of investigators is led by an experienced policewoman Dana Skálová (Monika Hilmerová). She understands people and always tries to help. She doesn't like to be limited by rules and customs. She lives a bit in chaos, does not deal with paperwork and sometimes goes late, but her work is always in the first place for her. Unlike Dana, her colleague Kateřina Vlčková (Simona Zmrzlá) is very pedantic, respects the rules, loves order and the system. Shee is constantly supplementing his education, studying new methods and procedures.",
