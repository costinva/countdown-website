  "overview": "For this new, two-part series the newly married couple, naturalist Steve Backshall and two-time Olympic gold medal-winning rower, Helen Glover, explore the breath-taking landscapes and fascinating culture of northern Japan. As a couple they are both deeply connected to the natural world; Steve through his vast knowledge of wildlife and global cultures and Helen through her passion for rowing and the great outdoors. Both have travelled the globe widely but have never been to this area of northern Japan. From the wild forests of Aomori to the ancient home of the Samurai, this programme explores a beautiful and fascinating land.",
