  "overview": "Daonuea, a working-age man that just broke up with his first love, takes a vacation to The Air Khao Yai and meets Nine, a man that improves his mood despite a short meeting. After Daonuea returns, Nine disappears for three months. He tries to forget all about Nine by returning to his old life, working with Tee, his first love. Still, Tee wants a second chance to return to their relationship. The situation changes as the company has no income at the time, and eventually they are forced to hand out portfolios to potential customers. Nine agrees to help Tee as a former schoolmate. Daonuea knows he wants to go back to Nine, but is rather reluctant as Nine has an on-and-off girlfriend. Despite all the obstacles, can Daonuea and Nine clear up their issues, and accept that they have fallen in love?",
