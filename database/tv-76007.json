  "overview": "Many years ago, a young married couple moved to an old house. The house is filled with items and statues used to worship the snake clan especially snake queen Gorgon. The wife was so disgusted that she destroyed them all. This enraged the ancient spirits and they placed a curse on her. At that time, she was pregnant with her twin daughters. So the curse was transferred to one of them, leading her to be the next Gorgon's descendant.",
