  "overview": "In this brand new series, cameras follow the lives of Stacey and Joe, their children, four ducks and two dogs. With exclusive behind the scenes access, viewers are given a refreshing, honest take on their modern blended family. Raising their â€˜pickles', Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle who are aged between 16 and one, is no mean feat especially combined with busy work schedules and ambitious passion projects like building a two acre fishing lake.",
