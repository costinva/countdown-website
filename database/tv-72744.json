  "overview": "Ukraine has its own wine and it is incredible. And we know very little about it. The history of Ukrainian winemaking stretches back to antiquity, and maybe even further. Having survived the Soviets with their anti-alcohol campaign and massive vineyard cutting, Ukrainian winemaking is actively developing. Since regaining independence, new vineyards have been planted, new wineries have emerged to experiment with wine styles and grape varieties, and our wines have won more and more awards at international competitions and blind tastings.The Wines of Ukraine series will show you local grape varieties, the best terroirs of different regions of Ukraine, traditional and new experimental wines. And most importantly, the project will tell you about the people behind modern Ukrainian winemaking and their journey to wine.",
