This two-part special investigates a series of critical events to reveal the moments that caused communism to fall, the Internet age to rise, and the country to go from the United States to Red State vs. Blue State. Featuring never before seen footage, and gripping commentary from the people who lived it, the series goes inside the events that forever changed America, and built our world today.",
