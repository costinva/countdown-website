  "overview": "What can a person do for survival? Others may not know, but Mei Lin is willing to sacrifice everything, including her body and dignity. She yearns for life to bloom recklessly like spring flowers in February, even if it's brief. However, in reality, she lives like a toad in the mud, hiding away, ugly and dirty. All she knows is that with life, other things can be discussed. If even life is gone, what else is there to talk about? Yet, she never expected that, in the end, she would fall into the hands of Murong Jin and that bastard â€“ the man who once treated her as a plaything to please another woman and was harshly repaid by her. That man, who is narrow-minded and holds grudges, turned out to be her final downfall.",
