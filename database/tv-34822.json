  "overview": "From nearly the time she was born, Cleopatra had to fight for the throne and for her life. She was raised in the palace of one of history's most ruthless royal families and had to use every skill in her arsenal--her brains, her charm, and her body--in order to survive. Cleopatra reveals how this capable sovereign survived a murderous and incestuous dynasty, securing her future by seducing one of Rome's greatest leaders, forming powerful alliances, and how her fall from grace and ultimate death meant history would never forget her legacy. The series draws on dramatic reconstructions and evidence from key experts to tell the real story behind Egypt's most well-known, enigmatic ruler.",
