  "overview": "Mark is a high school student at an elite school, whose carefree life ends one day: his beloved girlfriend Ailin becomes distant with zero explanation. At the same time, Mark begins to see strange targeted messages on his social media feed, which seem to be messages from the future as they describe events that begin to happen in real life. When he receives a \"target\" predicting that a life-threatening fire will break out at the school, he realizes he must act. Now, Mark needs not only to figure out his relationship with Ailin, but also to prevent a catastrophe by finding the arsonist. Having managed to convince his peers that the danger is real, they set out to prevent a catastrophe.",
