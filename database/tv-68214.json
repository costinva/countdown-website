  "overview": "Deadly Standoff takes you to the front lines of America's most deadly and infamous sieges, delving into the stories behind some of the most devastating standoffs in recent US history; from the early tensions that sparked these confrontations, to their deadly conclusions.From the MOVE bombing in 1985 to the Rainbow Farm massacre in 2001, this gripping anthology series gives a first-hand account of everything that happened, and the people behind each clash. It might be fuelled by religious convictions, or extreme political beliefs. It could spiral out of a miscarriage of justice, or even a simple misunderstanding. When a standoff begins however, the causes no longer matter.  All that matters is how it ends…… and who's left standing. ",
