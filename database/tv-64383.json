  "overview": "At school, Lee Da Yeol spends most of his time living as an outsider. Not popular by any stretch of the imagination, Dae Yeol's only real joy comes from his time spent with the archery club. A talented archer whose skills have earned him a scholarship to the school, Dae Yeol doesn't mind being an outsider, so long as he's free to pursue his greatest passion. But an ill-timed run-in with a devilishly handsome classmate lands him in trouble and places his precious scholarship in jeopardy.One of the school's most popular students, Jo Tae Hyun has always enjoyed a level of freedom that very few high school students have ever attained. Able to get away with practically anything, the entire school has no problem believing his side of the story when he's caught fooling around in the nurse's office with another student and Da Yeol. Claiming Da Yeol was trying to make out with him, Tae Hyun thoughtlessly puts the archer's scholarship at risk. Desperate to correct the misunderstanding, Da Yeol does everything he can to try to quell the rumors but no matter how hard he tries, it's just not enough.Completely unremorseful about what he's done, Tae Hyun seems to take a wicked sort of delight in doing everything he can to make Da Yeol's life miserable; his favorite method being to follow Da Yeol everywhere. Unable to shake Tae Hyun, Da Yeol spends his days loathing his shadow but the more time he spends with him, the more conflicted his feelings become; leaving him to wonder, where exactly does the line between hate and love end?",
