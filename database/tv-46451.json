  "overview": "Behind their sweet relationship is a love that is filled with bitterness and lies. Nulek felt her heart has been slashed when she suspects her boyfriend Mek, whom she thought was her world, is keeping something from her. Mek under the alias Warit is a \"rachasee\" member which literally translate to lion. He pretends to get close to Nulek only to get more information of her father Panu and his corrupted activities. And even though he got caught, breaking up with Nulek wasn't the answer. Mek must do everything to save the life of the woman he loves from the hands of the people in the shadows even though Nulek refuses to see his face anymore.",
