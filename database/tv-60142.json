  "overview": "Totally inexperienced, all they have to fall back on are their youth, passion, and the lessons they're learning in class--and yet the two are already getting dragged into a string of complex cases. But thanks to the help of classmates and full-fledged detectives, they begin to solve one crime after another. Polar opposites end up complementing each other's shortcomings as they combine action with deductive reasoning in this comical yet serious police drama so fast-paced, it'll leave you breathless.",
