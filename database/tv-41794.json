  "overview": "Mike and Karen are nearly-40-somethings that are giving their relationship another go, five years after they split. The pair were always meant to be together, but Mike's ambition to become a professional entertainer meant that he was never at home. Now in his late 30's, Mike has realised what's actually important to him - he's given up life on the road to come back to Scarborough and give their relationship another go. Set in the iconic North Yorkshire seaside town, the series follows the lives of a motley band of Scarborough residents who are bonded by family, friendship and their love of karaoke.",
