  "overview": "Failure is not an option for the Navy SEALsâ€”the world's most elite, special ops forces. In this action-packed new drama, these stealth and fearless warriors conduct high-risk clandestine missions against impossible odds. And when they return to the home front they face stress of a different nature. Keeping secrets, deploying at a moment's notice, and the knowledge that each assignment could be their last takes a toll on them and their families. But their unbreakable oath and patriotism compel them to persevere.",
