  "overview": "Snackmasters is a cooking challenge like no other, as each week, two well-known chefs battle it out to make perfect replicas of one of NZ's best-loved snacks. With nothing to help them other than limitless supplies of the snack and their taste buds, can they work out the genius behind these seemingly simple snacks? Join our hosts Kim Crossman and Tom Sainsbury as they follow some of NZ's top chefs every step of the way to share in their culinary triumphs and failures, while also heading to the heart of the product's factories to unlock for viewers the mysteries of how they're really made. Each episode culminates with the two chefs cooking their version of the snack head-to-head before a judging panel of the factory's workers. Which chef will be crowned champion? And can either capture the magic of the iconic snack?",
