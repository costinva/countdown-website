  "overview": "Women on Death Row tells the stories of America's most rarefied criminals: women who have been convicted of murder and sentenced to the ultimate punishmentâ€”the death penalty. Each episode profiles a harrowing crime and trial through exclusive interviews with the convicted women, witnesses, family members of victims, family members of the convicted women, attorneys, and law enforcement officials. The series also covers the appeals process, including resentencing in some cases, and looks at how new legislation in some states impacts the conditions under which the convicted women live in prison as they await their fate.",
