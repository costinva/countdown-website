  "overview": "Although promoted as a survival program, Idol School, as its name suggests, is similar to an actual school wherein for a total of 11 weeks, the participants will receive lessons in not only singing and dancing, but also the history of K-pop and everything that comes with being an idol in South Korea, such as mental training and appearing in public. Only female trainees age 11 and above who are not trainees of any entertainment company are allowed to join. The producer also clarified that former trainees and even former singers were also given the chance to participate. This caused some controversy as some people felt that it goes against its concept of 'training ordinary students' but despite this, a number of female participants who have previously trained under entertainment companies have made the cut.Viewers will vote live every episode and the students' 'grades' will be completely determined by it.",
