  "overview": "Dr Ranj Singh and his team offer help and support to some of the UK's most severe food phobics in this brand new and exclusive show.People from right across the country, whose lives have been held back by only being able to consume a very limited diet, visit the specially created Food Phobics hub. Whether that's the head chef who is unable to taste his own food for fear that he will gag, the Welsh drag queen whose addiction to bread is causing problems with his gastric band surgery, to the desperate 'mother to be', whose restricted diet might be affecting her ability to conceive, the hub is here to help them all.",
