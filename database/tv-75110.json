  "overview": "A political drama about the mysterious 1989 assassination of Deutsche Bank Chairman Alfred Herrhausen, who was near his home when his armored Mercedes-Benz was pierced by a roadside explosion nearby. This is an infamous unsolved murder in Germany set during the fall of the Berlin Wall, when geopolitical alliances were changing and, most importantly, when Herrhausen supported debt relieve for developing countries; something that other bank executives were not particularly fond of.Â ",
