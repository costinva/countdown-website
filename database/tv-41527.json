  "overview": "Smart speakers, electric cars, remote control golf trolleys, home saunas, high tech tents, dog cameras and pooper scooper vacuums â€“ the future is upon us but not everyone is happy about it: meet the Hard to Please OAPs - a group of no-nonsense grumpy old celebrities, some of whom like things done the old fashioned way. In this irreverent, fun-filled series they are bringing a good dose of common sense to state of the art products and services by getting off the sofa and trying them out for themselves. It's also an opportunity to let off steam about modern life and whether things were really better in the old days, before we became enslaved to wifi, automated ticket machines, satnavs and food delivery apps!",
