  "overview": "In the tiny tourist town of Bolton Landing, N.Y., the population explodes with thousands of summer visitors to Lake George and the Adirondack Mountains. The summer season is do or die for three members of one family, each with their own restaurant, who must make all their money for the year between July 4th and Labor Day. Their restaurants will live or die over the course of 10 intense weeks because it only takes one bad season to finish a restaurant for good.Â ",
