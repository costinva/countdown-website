  "overview": "From Whitehorse to the remote towns at the edge of the Arctic, the Yukon is one of the most challenging places on Earth to live... let alone be a first responder. But someone has to do the job. Yukon Rescue is a heart-pounding doc series about the Yukoners who answer the call to keep people safe in the rugged Canadian North. Featuring breaking cases from wildfire to search and rescue, animal services to highways, these front line workers go toe-to-toe with Mother Nature - battling lethal temperatures, vast distances, scarce supplies, and an unforgiving landscape to get the job done.  ",
