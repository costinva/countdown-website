  "overview": "On a cold November evening, a fatal chain reaction is triggered in the European power grid: Power plants shut down everywhere, elevators get stuck, trains stop - an entire continent disappears into the darkness. As the government and authorities grapple with the effects of the blackout, investigators focus on Pierre Manzano, a former hacker and environmental activist, because he claims that the blackout was a targeted attack. His supposed insider knowledge suddenly make Manzano, who actually wants to help Europol and the BKA, a suspect himself. With the search for the polluters, Manzano begins a race against time.",
