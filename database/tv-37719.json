  "overview": "De vloek van Woestewolf tracks the extraordinary adventures of Dr Kroch, healer of all ailments, wounds, bites and fractures, and his assistant Valet. When a coffer full of gold, with a letter pleading for help, is delivered to the doctor, he throws the half-indecipherable missive away as its sender claims to be suffering from... gold fever. The next day, when he is called away from his surgery, robbers Oenk and Boenk steal the coffer. There must be something special about this gold, and the doctor decides to respond to the letter and search for its sender: the Duke of Wolf Castle. Does this duke really exist, or is he just a legendary character? Does he live in a castle, or in the old ruins on top of a ghostly rock? Valet is scared, but in spite of a gypsy fortune-teller's warnings, the doctor perseveres: \"Ghosts do not exist. Science has an explanation for everything\".",
