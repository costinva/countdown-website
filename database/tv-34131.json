  "overview": "By depicting the dreams of people living in farming villages, this drama also reveals problems that today's residents of rural areas face, such as a growing number of biracial children from international marriages and the cutthroat competition to survive. Scenes showing picturesque rustic landscapes during each season spellbind viewers, as do heartwarming stories about the strong determination of people living in farming villages. While centering on people who have lived in farming villages for generations, this drama also portrays the lives of people who have moved to farmland from big cities and from abroad.",
