  "overview": "Carol Klein can't wait to welcome viewers to her delightful garden at Glebe Cottage in Devon, where the abundance of summer is with us, including a riot of beautiful irises, striking foxgloves and gorgeous selfseeded geraniums. For gardeners, summer is the time to start reaping the rewards of their hard work during winter and spring, and Carol is delighted to show off the results of some of the tasks and projects she showed us in the spring. ",
