  "overview": "Marta and Věra are employees of the discount portal leeevne.cz but their approach to life is completely different. Marta believes in its work which helps people and loves when everything is in order but is full of illusions. Věra has a strong experience with no illusions and she enjoys to improvise in order to cope with every situation.Brouček (their boss) is a kind of a manager who must manage and spy on everything and everyone like a dictator, so his two employees have a hard time.The characters of the show are thrown into situations where every discount they sell has a catch. For example a ride in a horse chaise without a horse, or a work shift in a mine without a return.",
