  "overview": "Love Andante unfolds in the tranquil yet tense setting of the Korean DMZ, where two contrasting souls find themselves drawn together. Following the formal end of the Korean War, the two Koreas established the Pyeonghwa Village in Goseong, Gangwon Province. Im Ju-hyeong, a prodigious pianist seeking respite from his demanding career, retreats to this haven. There, he encounters Ha Na-kyeong, the pragmatic daughter of a high-ranking North Korean officer and a doctor of pharmacy. As they navigate their lives in this village founded on hope and peace, their shared experiences and unexpected bond blossom into a poignant love story, bridging the divide between two worlds.",
