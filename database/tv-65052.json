  "overview": "Michael \"Bully\" Herbig and his two colleagues Christian Tramitz and Rick Kavanian shine in this sketch parade in countless roles and masks. Whether as the Austrian imperial couple Sissi and Franz(i) or as the gay crew of a spaceship - the parodies offer unimagined opportunities for punchlines of all kinds. Classics like \"Gossip Caf√© with Dimitri\" or the Czech TV talk show with Pavel and Bronko skilfully make fun of alleged foreign idiosyncrasies.",
