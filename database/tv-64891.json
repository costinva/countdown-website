  "overview": "Expedition leader Jarle Andh√∏y and his crew sail Berserk to the South Pole to plant the Norwegian flag at the pole 100 years after Amundsen. But while Jarle and Samuel are on the ice, Berserk disappears with three of the crew. Now, for the first time, we get to see the unique photos from the trip. This will be a strong story, and a story that will give us important insight into what happened before Berserk disappeared in the winter of 2011.",
