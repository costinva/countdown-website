  "overview": "The new ten-part series will be dedicated to up-and-coming young food talent between the ages of 18 and 25. Over the competition, the young hopefuls will be put through their paces by a panel of expert judges and exciting guests (TBA) as they undertake a variety of unique new challenges designed to push them to new culinary heights and reflect Britain's food revolution – where a new generation of young foodies are rewriting the rules. No prior experience will be necessary – applicants will be invited from anyone in the age group who thinks they have the raw talent, enthusiasm and dedication to transform themselves into the next foodie sensation.",
