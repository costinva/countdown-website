  "overview": "One of the longest running Japanese television series, Abarendo Shogun is much like most other chambara features. The show's hero is the cheerful and generous shogun Yoshimune Tokugawa, who routinely disguises himself as Shinosuke Tokuda, the third son of a poor hatamoto (a bannerman retainer of a shogun).In this disguise, he mingles unnoticed with the public in the city of Edo.",
