  "overview": "In the previous life, although Qin Yichen, the sage of alchemy, possessed the most alchemy technique in the mainland and was famous all over the world, but because of his mediocre martial arts attainments, he could only watch helplessly as his enemy Ouyang Haotian snatched the martial soul of his lover Feng Qianxue, and in front of his eyes Kill Feng Qianxue and his brother Tantai Shuo. In grief, Qin Yichen was reborn with the help of the Heaven and Earth Spirit Orb, returning to his youth!",
