  "overview": "People have to come up with brainy ideas, but zombies also have to engage in \"eating brains\" literally! Chav Yu Yeung-kwong loses his mind and rushes to the morgue as he notices something unusual about his body. He eats a human brain in front of his buddies, forensic intern Koo Tak-ming and doashi Wah Lun! Since then, Yeung-kwong possesses someone else's memory and skills when he eats their brain. One day, Yeung-kwong is so hungry that he wants to eat the brain of Mok Siu-chun, who is the daughter of some mahjong school boss. The duo get acquainted after a fight. After becoming a brain-eating zombie, Yeung-kwong uses other people's brains to experience all kinds of wonderful life moments. These experiences eventually result in him being somewhat enlightened, and so he decides to keep running his family hotpot restaurant business. Meanwhile, Yeung-kwong's granduncle Yu Gor eerily shows up and disappears around him. He even reveals the Yus' secrets. And a zombie disaster is also looming.",
