  "overview": "Bang on Budget follows a different household undertaking projects in their property. The family will be shown inspirational versions of their rooms, all done on various budgets, and pick their favourite. It will then be up to Lucy and builder Andy to try and replicate whichever rooms they pick, but they will have to stick to the owners' budget. If they go over on one room will have to claw back cash in another to balance the books.Together they will use their creativity and building know-how to come up with smart solutions, from clever little life hacks to serious renovation. They will show viewers how to get the look for less, and work out when you should shell out for a really key piece of kit, and when can you afford to use something that costs practically nothing.",
