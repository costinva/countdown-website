  "overview": "Cape Carnage: Killer Catch follows the Davey family, led by Captain Bruce, his wife, Juanita, and son Tiger, as they make their living in one of the most dangerous ways possible - hand line fishing in the treacherous waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, also infamously known as Cape Carnage, off the northern coast of Australia.The Gulf of Carpentaria is bustling with life; crocodile, tuna, and the apex predator - shark. From July to October, fishermen from all over Australia gather here to hunt for one fish in particular - the lucrative Spanish mackerel, and with some of the most sought-after flesh in the world, these are a million dollar catch worth fighting for.Captain Bruce and his family have been fishing these waters for more than half a century, and Tiger and his wife Prue are holding with family tradition by raising their two young children aboard the family boat, M. V. Wildcard. For the four months of the year when the prized Spanish mackerel are running, these seas and the Wildcard are their home, and they take on nature by hand, battling the weather, the sharks, and sometimes themselves, as they chase their fortune.Over ten episodes, as they face challenges at every turn, Cape Carnage: Killer Catch charts the blood, sweat and tears of the Davey family and crew through another turbulent fishing season and family life on board M. V. Wildcard.",
