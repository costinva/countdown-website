  "overview": "My Wonderful Life is thought to be the first show to focus on the emotionally charged 'legacy' aspect of terminal illness by following people approaching the end of life and giving them the gift of goodbye. While sad at times it is also heart-warming and funny and aims to encourage people to talk about dying, death and bereavement more openly. The series is narrated by the acclaimed British actress Julie Walters and is four episodes long with each episode focusing on a different person and the people in their lives.",
