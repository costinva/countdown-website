  "overview": "Días mejores follows Sara, a mother who suddenly finds herself a widow and unable to comfort her troubled young son. She finds help with a therapy group of very distinct characters who are all struggling with similar personal tragedy, among them a down-and-out rock musician forced to take care of the teenage kids he long ago abandoned, a seemingly in-control chief exec desperately trying to keep up a facade, and a lonely young woman who wishes to have the child of her lost love.",
