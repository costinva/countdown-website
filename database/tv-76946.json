  "overview": "At the outset of the Cold War, the USSR launched a secret surveillance mission on a scale the world had never seen. Soviet spies were tasked with mapping the entire globe. From eyes in the sky, to boots on the ground. They stalked the shadows behind enemy lines. Their records of buildings, transportation networks, power grids, and factories would generate over a million highly classified maps. Now, only 30 years out from the close of the Cold War, many strange missions are coming to light. Could finding the links between this monstrous resource, and other covert ops be the key to uncovering old plans of world domination?",
