  "overview": "Gavin Nelson is a journalist working for a local newspaper, The Weekly Herald. The editor, Jackie, does her best to keep Gavin on his toes, sending him out to cover local news stories about lost dogs and noisy neighbours. Gavin, however, is more interested in pursuing fellow reporter Clare Priddy. She likes Gavin, but is reluctant to get involved with anyone she works with.",
