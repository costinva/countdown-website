  "overview": "Granny's mouthwatering mac 'n' cheese recipe could be worth a nice chunk of change in this competition hosted by Guy Fieri, in which amateur cooks from around the country compete in a Kitchen Stadium-like arena, pitting their best dishes against one another in six categories: burgers, chicken, comfort foods, pasta, cakes and cookies. The ultimate winner takes home $25,000 and has his or her winning dish featured on the menu of T.G.I. Friday's restaurants.",
