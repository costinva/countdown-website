  "overview": "A story about love and relationships that could turn anyone into a loser. It will be portrayed in the form of a romantic comedy that shows the inherent pathetic sides of people and diverse thrilling moments that come with various forms of love. The hyperrealistic depiction of humans at their lowest will be accompanied by laughter and empathy that goes beyond discomfort. Seo Min Ki is a freshman in college who is majoring in Korean literature. He is a hesitant person with a lot on his mind who sometimes makes bold actions. Being a 20-year-old, the result of his actions are always a series of clumsiness and mistakes. However, because he's someone who thinks a lot and has an ideological personality, he always self-reflects. He is a simple outsider whose only wish is to drink with his friends and play games at internet cafes.",
