  "overview": "Magic tricks are a form of art that amazes both small children and adults. Illusionists sometimes do the impossible, and to do this they use incredible sleight of hand and the ability to act quietly and quickly. Hosts Alexey and Nazar invite celebrity guests to their place in order to make them doubt what they have seen. A popular performer whose money disappears in an unknown direction, a comedian whose passport will be mercilessly destroyed by fire, a famous blogger whose license will be confiscated, and many others come here. At the end of the episode, a winner is determined, and the magician who received the fewest votes suffers an unexpected punishment.",
