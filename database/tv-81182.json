  "overview": "Sergei, a factory worker, was assigned to entertain Olga, an important guest from Moscow. And the hard worker couldn't think of anything smarter than to simulate an attempted abduction of a girl in the style of the nineties, where he could \"save\" her. The result is twofold: Olga fell in love with Sergei, but after she found out that the kidnapping was a fake, she decides to take revenge on her \"savior\" by extreme methods. And now Sergei has to fight the girl's attempts to put him in prison by her father, a colonel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who did not appreciate the prank of a provincial adventurer and his growing feelings for the girl.",
