  "overview": "In Min motorsport, we follow various motorsports through their racing season. The sports, goals and prerequisites are different, but common to all of them is the passion for the sport and the environment they are in. Through this series we not only get an insight into different motorsports, but we also get to know the athletes better at home when they prepare for upcoming races.",
