  "overview": "Based on the hugely popular book series of the same name by Enid Blyton, Malory Towers is a live-action series following 12-year-old Darrell Rivers as she leaves home for the first time to attend an all-girls' boarding school. Set in the 1940s on the sun-drenched cliffs of the Cornish coast, Malory Towers explores this nostalgic world of midnight feasts, lacrosse, pranks, and lasting friendships. For a contemporary audience, the show is both aspirational and inspirational, telling the story of universal experiences include shifting cliques, FOMO, bullying, crushes, peer pressure, and self-doubt. The girls keep an eye on each other and, like a family, are forever connected by their shared experiences.",
