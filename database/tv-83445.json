  "overview": "HEY FUZZY YELLOW is a one of a kind show. It stands out, because it is different.The show is built around a central theme that is set in the initial narrative part of the show. That part is then followed by individual segments categorized in 4 main blocks: the Arts, Academic Skills, Creative Expression and Social-Emotional Skills.We want to show the kids watching the show, that there are many different approaches to a subject and every individual will find one that suits his or her talent and interest. Every child has the right to learn to express itself in a way that feels natural and good. HEY FUZZY YELLOW will show them that way and finding that way will help to build self-confidence.So, all of that, with a sauce of good, honest fun, lots of laughs and craziness, jokes and funny twists. We give you a new star in a new genre, which we like to call: FUNTAINMENT.The show is unique in so many different ways, just like children are unique in so many different ways.",
