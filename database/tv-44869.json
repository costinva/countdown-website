With the use of cutting-edge technology, the unique collection of artifacts salvaged from the underwater resting site of the wreck tells us brand new stories of love, deception, fate and heroics. Each episode follows the individual journeys of these artifacts from their recovery, to their connection to specific passengers on the ship and their connection to someone living today.",
