  "overview": "Foodie Love is about the relationship between two food lovers who meet through a mobile app.One half of the couple is a thirty-three-year-old book editor, smart, and somewhat suspicious of relationships. The other half is a successful mathematician, cultivated, and at times a little na√Øve.The two thirty-somethings embark on getting to know each other with the doubts of those who retain the scars of previous relationships. Over several dates they'll have to discover if their common devotion to Japanese yuzu or shared distaste for foodie pretension are enough to build the foundations of a lasting love story.",
