  "overview": "Wah was a hot-headed gangster until he was sent to prison for a triad murder. Upon his release, he opens a laundry shop in an old district where his estranged wife was last seen. Wah's peaceful days end when greedy developers show up in his neighbourhood eager to buy off a rundown building. Upstart gangster Happy promises to evict all tenants by any force necessary. Wah tries to look the other way until Fa, one of the residents in the building, and her son are attacked by delirious drug addicts. Despite his age, Wah decides to protect the building's helpless tenants by recruiting a group of rehabilitated gangsters to fend off the hostile aggressors. This film is supported by The Joseph Lau Luen Hung Charitable Trust and produced by the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers.",
