  "overview": "Seven women, passionate about their job as truck drivers, share their daily lives in the heart of the roads of France and Europe. They travel hundreds of kilometers at the wheel of their XXL trucks: 44 tons, the biggest gauges on the road. Every day they have to accomplish a new mission: load huge cargoes and deliver them on time. This race against the clock sometimes takes place in extreme conditions: snow, fog, mechanical problems... But nothing stops our queens of the road! Without ever renouncing their femininity and their sentimental and family life, they break the codes to live their love of the truck! More than a passion, this road job is a vocation.",
