  "overview": "Chain of Command is an intimate portrait of the war against violent extremism, and the men and women devoting their lives to it. With unprecedented access to the U.S. Armed Forces, Chain of Command inhabits the rarely-glimpsed innermost sanctums of the Pentagon, the front lines of battlefields across the world, and even the cockpit of a fighter jet on a mission.",
