  "overview": "Surreal black comedy about an assortment of odd characters trapped in an\n asylum, in a quiet English countryside. It is run by staff whose sanity\n is decidedly suspect, as proved by their admission of the local \npizza-delivery boy for trumped-up reasons. As the patients try bizarre \nescapes, we are left wondering whether the whole thing is a massive \nexperiment, or just a cruel hoax.",
