The investigation is led by commissioner Karol Nadzieja, transferred from the capital to Augustów. When the crime at the forester's lodge is finally solved and everyone breathes a sigh of relief, new victims appear. No one yet suspects that in this previously quiet neighborhood, where life was \"like God's home,\" a sophisticated and cunning serial killer has just begun his \"hunt.\" Fear falls on the city and its surroundings.",
