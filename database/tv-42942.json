  "overview": "You're Not a Monster demonstrates that even classic movie monsters have emotional issues--because the only thing worse than being undead is being unloved. A former psychiatrist-turned-vampire mentors his great-great grandson Max, a therapist who has inherited his practice. In each episode, Max treats classic monsters including Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and Medusa as they seek desperately needed therapeutic help.",
