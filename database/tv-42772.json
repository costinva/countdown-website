  "overview": "As a troubled young teenager, Todd Kohlhepp was described as a \"devil on a chain\" by those who knew him best, but no one could anticipate what would happen when that chain was let loose. On November 3, 2016, a young woman is found alive on Todd Kohlhepp's property after being held captive for two months in a shipping container. Following her rescue, Kala Brown reveals to Spartanburg County Sheriff's investigators that her captor, former real estate broker Todd Kohlhepp, is responsible for more crimes than local police ever knew possible.",
