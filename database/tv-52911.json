  "overview": "While spending a summer-long family vacation by the lake, siblings Tommy, Nikki, and Daniel Fisher discover that their seemingly boring parents are actually daring undercover spies, who are chasing a devious villain aiming to dry up the country's water supply. When the siblings realize their parents' mission is in jeopardy, they form a secret task force called THE SPYDERS in order to help them out. Tommy, 12, a cute, irresistible goofball; Nikki, 15, a well-meaning but impetuous leader, and Daniel, 16, a sedentary, anxiety-ridden computer nerd, use their brains, charm, audacity and unbridled enthusiasm to outwit and outsmart the villain, who has so far eluded their parents. Will the untrained, blundering Spyders succeed where mom and dad failed?",
