  "overview": "Joe Holt is thirteen. When his mum and her unsavoury boyfriend Dean suddenly announce they're going on holiday, Joe's thrilled at the prospect of a break from trouble at school and tension at home… until it becomes clear that while his mum and Dean are heading off for Spain, Joe's being left behind in their Peckham flat. His mum calls it \"a holiday at home\". Dean calls it \"a secret\", and says Joe needs to keep out of sight for a week or face some nasty consequences.Left ‘all alone' with £10 for the electric meter and a fridge half-full of leftovers, Joe plays X-box, stays up all night (and regrets it), makes a surprise friend in a girl called Asha who also seems to be parentless for the week, counts off the days… and discovers a sealed bag lodged in the lavatory cistern. Inside the bag is £20,000 in used cash. However, that's only the start of Joe's troubles. When the week's over, his mum and Dean don't show up and Joe knows life's about to get a whole lot more difficult…",
