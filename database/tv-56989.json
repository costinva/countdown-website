  "overview": "On an unforgettable island paradise in the Philippines, things get wild when 8 single men and 8 single women come together to embark on the most extreme dating experience of all time as they attempt to find true love while working together to survive the elements and each other. While endless miles of white sandy beaches and clear turquoise water may seem like the perfect setting to fall in love, don't let this Garden of Eden fool you. With no food, water or clothes readily available, these singles will be both physically and emotionally vulnerable and forced to depend on each other.",
