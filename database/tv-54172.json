Married to his job, he is the consummate professional, and has all but resolved to remain single so he can focus his time and effort on making sure his business endeavors go off without a hitch. But life changes forever on the day he meets Tang Fei at a design fair. She is a lively young woman with a passion for traditional embroidery, and plans to hone her skills by studying in Europe. Although they adore spending time together, they refuse to consider the notion of changing their own long-set plans.
