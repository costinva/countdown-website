  "overview": "They run through deserts, ice and snow, deep in the jungle, along water and over mountains: the world's most dangerous roads, truly \"hot roads.\" Many have died along these roads, which are in Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Russia and Serbia. Yet for lack of alternative routes, locals continue to use them for transportation. The landscapes through which these routes wind are unique and exert their never-ending fascination even on regular travelers. In the 13-part film series \"Hot Roads – The World's Most Dangerous Streets\" accompanies people on adventures where the journey is its own reward, though the journey's end is equally eagerly anticipated. It tells stories that take place along the routes itself, of the people who live along them and for whom these are part and parcel of their personal destiny. The filmmakers tag along in the driver's seat of trucks, on the rear benches of busses and in the passenger seat of regular cars to experience the danger and beauty these roads offer from different perspectives – through the windshield and in the rear-view mirror simultaneously.",
