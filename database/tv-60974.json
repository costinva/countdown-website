  "overview": "A Besúgó is set in 1985, behind the Iron Curtain, as Geri leaves for college. He is looking forward to meeting girls and partying and joins a group of radicals, led by the charismatic Száva. But Geri has a secret. He's an informant of the totalitarian state and to save his brother, he's been forced to spy on his new friends for State Security. While Geri's life changes forever – juggling parties and political debates – he wrestles with a daily challenge; whose side should he be on? Especially when the group's increasingly radical leader, Száva realizes that there is an informant among them.",
