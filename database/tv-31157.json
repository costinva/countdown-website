  "overview": "Series concept is based around the irony of farm animals who know nothing about\n living in the country. They are a bunch of fastlane pampered city \nanimals who live a star studded life in a popular nursery petting zoo, \nbut their lives take a funny unexpected turn when they suddenly get \nrelocated. To top it off their new home is nothing like one would expect\n from a simple old farm. At its core, this series is aiming at twisting \nand repackaging a strong and timeless farm theme into a fast, edgy \ncomedy.",
