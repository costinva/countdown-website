  "overview": "In the 1970s, Detroit was experiencing an economic boom in the automobile industry, and lush neighborhoods housed the rich beneficiaries of Motor City. But the idyllic suburban life ended abruptly when four children were abducted and killed by the Oakland County Child Killer in the dead of winter. Fears of a serial killer targeting children haunted the region for 13 months, with parents warning their children to stay away from strangers and keep close to home. Then, the killings stopped.",
