  "overview": "A panel with some of Sweden's sharpest comedians will roast some of Sweden's biggest celebrities. Whoever gets roasted gets to enjoy, from the place of honor on Bern's stage in Stockholm, how he or she is treated when the Swedish comedian elite uses the crudest humor artillery. Because in Roast you can joke about anything...and more besides. At the end of each roast, the guest of honor gets a chance to give back if they want. And they want that.",
