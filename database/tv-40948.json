  "overview": "Gospel music is bigger than ever, with songs beloved by generations and sung by arguably the best singers in the world. Sunday Best undergoes a nationwide search to storefront churches, parishes and mega-churches across the country to find the best undiscovered singers in America. The top contestants are coached by great performers from the gospel and secular worlds as they strive to win the Sunday Best title. Celebrity singers such as Patti LaBelle, Kirk Franklin, and Shirley Caesar work with these up-and-comers as they take their praise to the next level.",
