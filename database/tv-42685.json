  "overview": "Levison Wood embarks on a rarely ventured route through challenging environments into remote corners of a little-understood land. Arabia. Beautifully filmed and with the warm and engaging Lev as our guide, Arabia tells the real story of the Middle East through its people. The series explores the lives and hopes of an eclectic range of characters - Syrian grandmothers, Iraqi snipers, shepherds, drug dealers, freedom fighters and nomads - and we hear Levison reflect throughout on how his preconceptions may have changed or remained during his most extraordinary adventure yet. With his elite military training, Levison has the necessary skills to tackle the very toughest challenges. And while he uses these skills to access remote communities and potentially hostile urban worlds, this is far from a simple survivalist story.",
