  "overview": "Every day of Roma and Zhenya's teenage brothers goes the same way, on the machine: alarm clock, study, cigarette behind the garage, a warehouse with weapons ... wait, what? The guys decide that this is a chance to quickly cut down easy money, because all you have to do is sell the machines on the darknet. But where there are weapons, there are dangerous people — that's where the fun begins. Very soon, all the residents of the town are involved in the story: single mother Svetlana, pawnshop owner Albert, tattoo artist Lelya, policeman Basov, his blogger daughter Milena, as well as the capital's bandits.",
