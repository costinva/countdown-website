  "overview": "Three friends from a provincial town - Zhanna, Zoyka and Milady - after graduating from school, they set off to fulfill the dream of Chekhov's three sisters. To Moscow! To Moscow! The city of dreams, fulfillment of desires and miracles - this is how it seems to them from afar. Zhanna dreams of the laurels of a great singer, Zoyka dreams of her husband - a real colonel and a bunch of children, and Milady dreams of the glory of a supermodel or, at worst, a movie star. But real life makes its own adjustments to the girls' plans. Rainbow dreams threaten to burst like a soap bubble. You still have to fight for their implementation, using cunning, elbows, and claws.",
