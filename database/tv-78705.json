  "overview": "The series tells the story of the difficult years of the Nazi occupation, seen from the perspective of three young Polish women. Marysia, Ewka and Irka are very young girls who, on the threshold of their adult lives, were dealt a war by fate â€“ one of the most terrible wars that have befallen their country. They are not yet mothers, nor are they wives. Prepared for the first twenty years of childhood and youth to live according to the standards of their environment, they suddenly found themselves defenseless against the powerful forces of evil and darkness. And they decided to take up the fight against them. And for this fight to be effective, they must change and adapt to new conditions. Each of the heroines must face their own fears and the brutal reality of the occupation. Their stories are not only a fight for survival, but also a story of courage, sacrifice and solidarity.",
