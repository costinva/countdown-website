  "overview": "Three very different women are forced to share a single jail cell after a chance encounter. An ordinary mother, a rebellious young criminal offender, and a brilliant researcher: nothing about their background, education, race or reason for incarceration would suggest that they can find common ground. But the physical confines and psychological stress brought on by inhumane cohabitation forces them to share their crimes, fears, and hopes for the future. Longings that are different and yet - still the same.",
