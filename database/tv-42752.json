  "overview": "Told from the perspective of victims, families, colleagues and law enforcement, each episode of License to Kill exposes what happens when the hands that should heal are used to cause harm on patients at the most vulnerable times. Whether these doctors spiraled out of control over money, jealousy, power or from mental breakdown, viewers will get a look inside these killers' minds who lost sight of their Hippocratic Oath and used their practice for evil, leaving their patients sick, injured, paralyzed or even dead. The series recounts how authorities were finally able to stop these medical professionals' malpractice, putting an end to the madness before someone else got hurt or killed.",
