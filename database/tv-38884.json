  "overview": "The End is about Dr Kate Brennan, an Australian-based specialist in palliative care. Euthanasia is a hot-button topic in Kate's field of work, and she is passionate in her opposition. On the other side of the world, Kate's mother Edie Henley feels just as strongly about her right to die. After she attempts to take her own life, Kate has little choice but to ship her out from England and deposit her in a nearby retirement village in the Gold Coast - Edie's worst nightmare.While Kate struggles with her own problems, her children are trying to work out who they are, and who they want to be. What follows is a story about parents and children, ethics and emotion, and mostly how it's never too late to start again.",
