  "overview": "Under the watchful eye of host Rossi Morreale, five teams composed of a pumpkin carving expert, cake artist and sugar artist will battle it out as they create Halloween-themed edible displays that will send chills up your spine. In each episode, teams will face two grueling challenges. First, they'll face off in the Small Scare, where they must create a Halloween-themed design in just 45 minutes. One winning team gets an advantage in the big battle - the Spine Chiller. In the end, their creations will be judged by renowned cake decorator Shinmin Li and make-up artist Brian Kinney, and a rotating panel of celebrity guest judges who are legends in the horror genre. One team will be eliminated after each episode. In the end only one team will be declared Halloween Wars Champion, and walk away with a $50,000 grand prize.",
