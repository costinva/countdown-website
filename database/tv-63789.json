  "overview": "50 years after the terrorist attack on the Olympic Games, a friendly soccer match between an Israeli and a German football club is planned, as a memorial service for the victims of the 1972 event. Police and secret services are on high alert to ensure the security of the event. When Oren Simon, a Mossad agent stationed in Berlin, intercepts a message in a dark web forum, just days before the game, he is partnered with Maria Köhler, a German State Criminal Police officer (LKA),  with Lebanese roots. All sides must come together to ensure that history does not repeat itself.",
