  "overview": "Ten years ago, fresh off the set of RuPaul's Drag Race Season 5, Alyssa Edwards started sharing secrets in the studio at World of Wonder. After a decade of foolishness and tomfoolery, it's time to get back to the basics. Alyssa's Secret: The ReBOOT is a revamp of the OG series we fell in love with a decade ago. In each episode, Alyssa will share her secret to a variety of topics, such as: keeping calm, feeling seductive and her secret to a healthy, happy day. The ReBOOT would not be complete without a surprise celebrity guest! Tune in every Wednesday to WOW Presents Plus starting April 26, because if it ain't broke, don't fix itâ€¦ remix it!",
