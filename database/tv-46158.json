  "overview": "On the surface Kitty, Margot, Bree and Olivia appear to have nothing in common but there's one passion which unites them - to expose injustice. They form their own secret society, DGM - they Don't Get Mad, they Get Even - playing anonymous pranks to expose bullies. But when their latest target, Ronny, ends up dead with a DGM card in his hands, the girls realise that they're not as anonymous as they thought - someone now wants revenge.",
