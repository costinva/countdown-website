  "overview": "Hoping to reverse the two-decade-long decline of boxing's popularity, specifically in his native South Boston, gym owner and former fighter Peter Welch formulates a revitalization plan. The Fighters documents his efforts to bring together rival trainers and amateur boxers to represent their gyms in weekly bouts. After seven days of intense training, the fighters face off in the ring with perhaps their professional futures at stake. Each episode captures the daily struggles, personal relationships and arduous training sessions as the young men prepare to defend their pride as well as help save a sport that was once integral to `Southie's' culture.",
