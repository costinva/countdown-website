  "overview": "Popular artists perform their favorite hits, but do not even suspect with whom they perform in a duet. On stage, they are separated by a large glass wall, and the main task of the participants is to guess who is behind it before the end of the song. Sometimes it is very difficult, because absolutely anyone can be a partner: a relative or a former love, a friend or an irreconcilable rival, a master or an aspiring performer.  ",
