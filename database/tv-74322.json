  "overview": "The arena depicts daily life with humor and realism through characters living in this emblematic place. From the players' bench to the canteen, via the ice and the stands, each scene offers a self-deprecating satire on real life. Whether it's hockey, figure skating, greasy fries or zamboni, nothing escapes parody, featuring a gallery of endearing characters who resonate with each of us. ",
