  "overview": "As greed and power collide, one woman will get the attention of our most influential leaders, with a biological weapon that threatens the entire future of the Western world. When a Columbian drug trial goes wrong and union leader Maria Puerto witnesses the slow death of her teenage son, she vows to unravel the deadly conspiracy behind his murder and the terrible secret of a biological weapon. Maria enlists the aid of her friend, documentary filmmaker Leonie. Leonie is also the daughter of the Canadian Prime Minister, who is on the eve of hosting a crucial G8 Summit. Armed with a vial of smallpox infected blood, Maria makes her way to the Summit, determined to unmask the culprits and, with Leonie's help, put an end to the lethal exploitation of the working classes of the developing world. On their heels is Thom Lightstone, a leading bio-terrorism expert investigating the tragedy in Columbia. Despite contradictory evidence and restricted access to government files, all roads lead Thom to one manâ€”the powerful head of an international pharmaceutical company, based in London, where an ultimatum is in place: mercilessly pursue Maria at all costs and bring the woman in, dead or alive. But the situation dramatically worsens as Leonie falls ill and other victims succumb, one by one. Now it's up to Maria and Thom to embark on a painstaking race against the clock to find an antidote before the fate of millions is sealed.",
