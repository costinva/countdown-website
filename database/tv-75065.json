  "overview": "In her first year of high school, Bu Hanlu was determined to become a pilot. This dream originated from her childhood, where her sister, Captain Bu Hanyu of the Red Lotus Team, was captured by aliens while trying to protect her. For years, Bu Hanlu worked hard with the sole purpose of rescuing her sister. Due to a pair of gloves, Bu Hanlu formed an unexpected connection with Lin Qianyu, the school bully. The school bully and the stubborn girl engaged in multiple rounds of confrontation, from competing for the gloves to claiming the rooftop, and even waging a prank war. Bu Hanlu's drama-loving group and Lin Qianyu's villainous gang ended up forming a friendship. To fulfill Bu Hanlu's dream of establishing an astronomy club, everyone joined forces to search for UFOs and investigate the disappearance of a telescope. The friends discovered that Bu Hanlu had been suffering from \"alien delusions.\" Lin Qianyu's sister, Lin Qianqian, turned out to be the mastermind behind this scheme. She was actually a good friend of Bu Hanyu and, in order to help fulfill her friend's last wish, created an extraterrestrial illusion for Bu Hanlu. Upon learning the truth, Bu Hanlu realized that youth is not about waiting but is built on the foundation of these lovely friends.",
