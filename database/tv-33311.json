  "overview": "Two irresistible forces come together: love and chocolate. Rosita Amado, who inherits the key to the success of \"Chocolates Supremo,\" and Bruce RÃ©mington, a millionaire, live a love story. Rosita has a spectacular body, but her nose causes men to reject her. Even Bruce himself is not attracted to her. In time, her pure and noble soul conquers his heart. Juan Amado, the founder of the company, entrusts a mission to his granddaughter: to keep the family recipe and the delicacy of the gods a secret. They are the petals of a special flower that grows in his town around the statue of Ek-Chuah, the \"God of Chocolate.\" Revealing the secret ingredient or letting someone else prepare it would make Ek-Chuah's blessing disappear.",
