  "overview": "Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu centers around Y큰to Ayase and Haruka Nogizaka. Y큰to is seemingly ordinary, but Haruka is attractive, intelligent, and rich, which prompts other students to idolize her. One day, Y큰to wanders into the school library in order to return a book and accidentally stumbles upon Haruka's deepest, darkest secret: she is a diehard fan of anime and manga, in other words, a regular otaku. Promising Haruka to keep this a secret, Y큰to becomes her advisor and confidante of sorts.",
