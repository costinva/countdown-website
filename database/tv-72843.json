After sunset, the presenter appears, who has only an hour to search for the six. The participants themselves are ready to do anything to prevent Creed from finding them. Even if you have to close yourself in a room without air, freeze in a cold basement, hang at a height for a long time, make up beyond recognition and learn a dangerous stunt trick.",
