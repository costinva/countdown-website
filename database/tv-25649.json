  "overview": "Willie Harcourt-Cooze attempts to create the finest, purest chocolate bar in the world, and teach a nation of chocoholics how wonderful real chocolate can be. We may spend more per head on chocolate than any other nation in Europe, but few Brits eat truly authentic chocolate; and Willie wants to re-educate the public about how chocolate should really taste.",
