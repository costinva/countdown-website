  "overview": "Former RuPaul's Drag Race contestants Trixie Mattel have been hosting a weekly digital series, UNHhhh, since last year. The two talk about everything from their childhood to porn and religionâ€”and Katya's love for Contact. Now Trixie and Katya are making the leap from YouTube to Viceland, Vice's cable network, home to Gaycation with Ellen Page. Premiering November 1, The Trixie &amp; Katya Show will be \"a hilarious hybrid of late night, daytime, and advice shows\" according to a statement released today by the channel. The girls will continue to cover a wide range of topics all while trying to make each other laugh with bad puns and embarrassing stories.",
