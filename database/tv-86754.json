  "overview": "Serial killer. Grave robber. Psycho. In the frozen fields of 1950s rural Wisconsin, a friendly, mild-mannered recluse named Eddie Gein lived quietly on a decaying farm â€“ hiding a house of horrors so gruesome it would redefine the American nightmare. Driven by isolation, psychosis, and an all-consuming obsession with his mother, Gein's perverse crimes birthed a new kind of monster that would haunt Hollywood for decades. From Psycho to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to The Silence of the Lambs, Gein's macabre legacy gave birth to fictional monsters born in his image and ignited a cultural obsession with the criminally deviant. Ed Gein didn't just influence a genre -- he became the blueprint for modern horror.Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan's groundbreaking anthology series returns with its third, most harrowing installment yet. Monster: The Ed Gein Story tells the story of how one simple man in Plainfield, Wisconsin became history's most singular ghoul. He revealed to the world the most horrific truth of all -- that monsters aren't born, they're made...by us.",
