  "overview": "Ebba och Didrik is the warm, compassionate and laugh-out-loud funny tale of a young brother and sister growing up in a small town in the south of contemporary Sweden. The main focus is on Ebba and Didrik's tentative ventures into love - their (puppy) love stories and crushes are hilarious, heartbreaking and... so endearing - but it also revolves on the Reng family and their tragicomic domestic clashes and relationships.",
