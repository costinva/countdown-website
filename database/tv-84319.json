  "overview": "Esmeralda, whom everybody calls \"The Stray Cat\", grew up in a suburban slum under miserable conditions; ever since she was a little girl she has lived with Doña Rita, who exploits her by sending her out on the streets to beg or sell candies in order to \"earn her food and bed\". As a child, she became friends with Pablo, a wealthy child who cares for her and tries to help her behind his mother´s back, Lorenza, who looks down on \"The Stray Cat\" due to her social prejudices which make her reject poor, uneducated people. Esmeralda has turned into a beautiful woman over time and although she is still very poor, she has managed to always look pretty in front of Pablo. They have grown together, but Pablo has problems with noticing that he feels more than just affection for her.",
