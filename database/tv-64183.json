  "overview": "A group of young people get lost during a weekend hike and, faced with the risks encountered in the forest, they seek shelter in a village hidden under a constant fog that is not on the maps: the Serene Valley.Â What they could not imagine is that it is a cursed place, with no exit and no communication with the rest of the world, where the hands of the clock have stopped moving. While trying to understand what actually happened and what holds them in that mysterious - and in a way, magical - place with supernatural phenomena, the youngsters will find themselves in the middle of a dark secret that has remained hidden for more than a century.",
