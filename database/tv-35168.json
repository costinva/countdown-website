  "overview": "The wife of a motor mechanic, Fyodor Kurbatov, gives birth to two unwanted twin daughters. Having arranged things with the doctor, Fyodor, who is also a reckless drunkard, gives one of the babies for adoption to the family of a wealthy businessman, Kirill Olshansky, whose wife had recently given birth to a dead baby boy. Fyodor sees this arrangement as a means of securing financial security for himself and his family in the future, but, twenty years later, the children have to pay for the mistakes of their parents. After many trials, the twin sisters, Eugenia and Alina, achieve justice and the two families are reunited at the two opposite 'poles of love'.",
