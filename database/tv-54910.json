  "overview": "Philippe Lacheau has invited 10 actors and comedians to live a unique experience in a grandiose setting. There is only one rule to follow for the next 6 hours: if you laugh, you are eliminated. The 10 comedians will have to keep cool despite having to try and make each other laugh. The winner will get 50 000 euros for the charity he/she represents. Nothing is off limits!",
