  "overview": "Jes, a young woman of about thirty, has had a relationship with Gert for a long time. He is offered a wonderful job in Shanghai. They are selling their house. She quits her job and then the existential questions begin. Is this the life she's always dreamed of? Should she give up her own ambitions to go through life in China as \"the wife of\"? So no. Jes does not leave for Shanghai, but opts for Brussels. Fortunately she has friends and a sister there. That is also where her search for a new life begins.",
