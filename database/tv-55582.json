  "overview": "The Wall Philippines is a wildly unpredictable, fast and simple game show with huge cash sums on the line. Two players must work together to tackle the mammoth four-storey high wall. Emotions run high as the pair's faith in one another is tested by unpredictable outcomes and ever-rising stakes.The rules are simple. If the players answer a trivia question correctly, the ball turns green as it falls randomly down the wall towards slots of varying cash amounts. These amounts are then added to the player's prize pot. However, answer a question incorrectly and the ball turns red and deducts the amount from the player's totals from the slot it lands in.Â ",
