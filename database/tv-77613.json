  "overview": "A brutal sexual assault in a locked hotel room leaves one woman and her husband, Kobi, broken and forced to move on with their lives without any answers. The two police investigators – Avi Avraham and Orna Denis – have few leads to go on – and completely different theories about how to pursue the investigation.Kobi cannot accept the fact that they'll likely never know who attacked his wife. When the police tell him yet again to \"be patient\", he decides to take matters into his own hands, going rogue and conducting his own private inquiries in parallel to the official investigation.When another woman is assaulted in the same hotel chain, the race to catch the perpetrator heats up, with both Kobi and the investigators in pursuit of the truth and justice – with tragic results.",
