  "overview": "Three bears have mysteriously disappeared from the ZOO. And what's worse - the porter died during the nocturnal assault on the security guard. An extensive search for the possible motives for the bizarre theft of the big predators is launched immediately, and the clues lead to illicit business with rare animals. Who's the chief suspect? And why one of his accomplices becomes victim of a premeditated murder?",
