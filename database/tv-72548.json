The police rush to the young influencer's home and find her drugged and mutilated like the other victims but still alive.In order to catch the culprit as quickly as possible, Commissioner Agathe Ruffin takes the risk of integrating Léna into her team in order to benefit from her knowledge of social media. Léna manages to communicate with the killer and get a clue about his next victim, but the ensuing police operation turns into a fiasco and leads to the humiliation of the police on social media.From being a valuable collaborator, Léna becomes a suspect in the eyes of the commissioner and her police officers.",
