  "overview": "Hosted by Craig Charles, the high-stakes quiz show sees contestants given a series of general knowledge questions, with the answers on moneybags that pass along a conveyer belt in front of them. The contestants will have to think quickly to grab the right answer and see how much that bag is worth. A bag with the correct answer can be work anything from £1000 to £100,000, but if contestants pick the wrong bag, they could lose everything.",
