  "overview": "Kazuhiro Kitase's only hobby? Sleeping, of course. Since childhood, his dreams have been a portal to exhilarating adventures with an elf girl. During one of their explorations through ancient ruins, they both get scorched by a dragon, and Kazuhiro wakes up like usual. Except this time, he finds a familiar figure in bed beside himâ€”the elf girl from his dreams.",
