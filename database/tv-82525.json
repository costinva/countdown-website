  "overview": "Seul Gi gets a job at a chocolate shop and, no matter how hard she tries, she can't seem to adapt to the environment. Despite trying to overcome her alienation with positivity, she always ends up getting hurt. One day, at Honggeumdang, a place she visited to fix a broken watch, Seul Gi falls in love with the charm of whiskey and artisanal chocolate. With this in mind, she becomes the only member of a task force that will participate in an internal Valentine's Day contest. She starts collaborating with the owner of Honggeumdang to create the best chocolate ever, but ends up having trouble finding teammates. That's when Hyun Nam, a chocolate freak, and Jeremy, an outgoing influencer, show up. Now, this trio and Mr. Hong, who is nice in a weird way, will have the chance to create the best Valentine's Day chocolate.",
