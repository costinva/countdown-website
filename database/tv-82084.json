  "overview": "ITV's acclaimed drama series Unforgotten fictionalises a modern-day police team investigating cold case murders and gradually unravelling long-forgotten secrets.Now this new programme from the BAFTA - and multi-award-winning Brinkworth Productions delivers the real thing - with full access to the investigation for the last six years, this series follows a police unit as they bring one of the most intractable murder cases from the past to justice. Just like the drama, the officers never forget that at the core of a murder investigation is the saddest human tragedy.Completely embedded in the unit, the programmes witness the case as it unfolds in front of us - we are there as detectives pick their way through the dead ends and frail memories to discover the truth; we are with them as they target and arrest the suspects; we are in the room as they plan the whole interrogation process, including how they tackle the lies and inconsistencies they have found. Stage by stage and hour by hour, we see every major step of the way as justice is finally served.In what may be potentially a first, the films have access not just to the whole police investigation, but also their meetings with the CPS and with their King's Counsel as they discuss how and when to get the suspects to charge and court.Taking viewers inside a world where no crime is truly forgotten - and no stone is left unturned - this series is truly The Real Unforgotten.",
