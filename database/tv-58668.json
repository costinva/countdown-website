  "overview": "Henry Phyfe is an accountant who happens to be a dead ringer for master spy U-31 in the Counterintelligence Service, and, as a patriotic American, Henry is asked to impersonate U-31 and carry out delicate missions Thursday after Thursday. Henry's chief tormentor is Fred Clark, the tall, bald, snapping turtle, who plays Gerald B. Hannahan, deputy region chief of the CIS. Each episode Hannahan puts the arm on Phyfe to go out and do his duty for the government, Valley Forge and the New York Mets.",
