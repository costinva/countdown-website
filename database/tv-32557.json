  "overview": "Four beautiful, successful women - childhood friends that are brought back together as adults - have old scores to settle, and new rivalries set to develop. As teenagers, Arzu, Merve and Pelin played a cruel prank on their over-achieving best friend Oya, leaving her shamed, devastated and suicidal. Over the years the three remained close but didn't hear again from Oya, never daring to make contact, fearing the worst - that they had driven her to take her own life. When fate brings the foursome back together, Oya is convinced to move back close to the women who threatened to ruin her life, and seek her final revenge.",
