  "overview": "INFINITE's Ranking King, much like the show that inspired the program, the show will number each of the members from one to seven as the boys embark on the up-hill challenge to see who the most popular member is, whether it be as voted by the fans, or even as voted by the members themselves. The program will see the members' desperate attempts to appeal to not only fans, but with each other to test who is \"number one\" within the group. The members with the most popularity will be proudly taking the number once place, followed by the second, third, ending with the seventh member, who in this case will be marked as the \"least popular\".",
