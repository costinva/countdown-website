  "overview": "At the center is Hannes Beck, who for years ran the household and took care of the education of the four children. One day he caught his wife Kirsten in a flash with another guy.Immediately the houseman draws radical consequences: he grabs the children, moves with them into a new apartment and plans, without further ado, his entry into professional life. Beck is back!When pondering how he should now make his living, Beck falls into his law studies. Why not the job of a public defender? Unfortunately, Hannes Beck has little idea of the legal practice and so the start for the bloody beginner is anything but smooth. Fortunately, his 54-year-old cleaner, Jasmina, turns out to be a great support: She was once a judge in her Croatian homeland and is appointed by Beck as a lawyer's assistant.",
