  "overview": "Sprung follows Jack, a convicted criminal who is determined to change course and reclaim his lost years after serving more than two decades in prison. With no place to live post-release, and a global pandemic bringing the world to a virtual standstill, Jack moves in with his former cellmate Rooster, Rooster's mom Barb, and Jack's former prison girlfriend Gloria. Bound by their marred past and unusual living circumstances, they decide to start righting some of society's wrongs, targeting those people selfishly taking advantage of others during the pandemic.",
