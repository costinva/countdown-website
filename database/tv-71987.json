  "overview": "Passionate student Ryan gets an internship as an assistant director where he meets Jane, an AD with a unique ability to extinguish the fires of people's passion. Ryan's suffering is vented to this year's fellow trainees, including a couple consisting of account executive Bamee and editor The, Pah in the art department, and Pie in production. As Ryan continues his training, however, he comes to find that P'Jane is kinder than people think, to the point that Ryan's heart sometimes skips a beat and it becomes his goal to win Jane's heart.",
