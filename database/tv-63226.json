  "overview": "The enemies are still strong, smart, and often have personal scores with Batia, Bagira, Bison, Prigotov, and other fighters-the legendary \"Sea Devils.\" This time, the Akula militant group is opposed by a satellite of the Western special services, the Bellona PMC, led by spy Irma Swanson and her deputy Kevin Maxwell. According to their leadership, they are the very \"explosive mixture\" that can destroy the squad and discredit the KTC. The Sharks, led by Batya and Bagira, find themselves at the forefront of an invisible front, constantly emerging from seemingly intractable situations as winners.",
