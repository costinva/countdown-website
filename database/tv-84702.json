  "overview": "Spanning nine South American countries, the Amazon is the largest rainforest on the planet. Home to over two and a half million species, each uniquely adapted to stay alive in a landscape of lush, tropical jungle.Volatile weather, hungry predators and dangers lurking around every tree trunk, in Surviving the Amazon we explore just what it takes to grow-up, hunt, and find love when the odds are stacked against you.",
