  "overview": "The further sequel to the legendary serial takes us right up to the present. At the 50th anniversary of the regional hospital in Bor we enjoy a reunion with all the characters who are still working at the hospital, we will be intrigued to see how the old hospital traditions are being taken up - or not being taken up - by their children, and we meet new characters who will bring new turns to the story.",
