  "overview": "In a small town, where everyone knows each other, there are three employees of the patrol service, Valera, Sanych and Lyonya. Their attitude towards work cannot be called conscientious. Often, when faced with the criminal world, they have to act outside the box, sometimes even paradoxically and stupidly, breaking the law. Each appearance on duty is a separate dangerous adventure with a series of ridiculous situations, shootings, accidental killings and, of course, sparkling dialogues. Often they out of the blue create problems for themselves, from which they then have to extricate themselves.",
