  "overview": "Tattoo Wars pits the best tattoo artists of our time against each other in a head to head creation competition. In each episode we explore the world, legend and work of two internationally acclaimed tattooists. Then we travel to a huge tattoo expo where our stars, in three hours time, ink a tattoo on the skin of two willing clients. These creations have a common theme, such as a dragon, a calla lily, a sailor, a tribal gauntlet, or a hanya (Japanese devil mask) but are rendered in the unique style of each artist. As the show closes, thousands of show attendees vote for the creation they like the best and the winning artist takes home the Tattoo Wars trophy.",
