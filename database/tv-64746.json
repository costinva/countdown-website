  "overview": "Jeremy Larkin, Isak Poole, Henry Abington, and Elizabeth Coates were members of \"the Yankee Doodle Society\", a rebel group based in Chester, Pennsylvania in 1777. Reporting directly to General Lafayette, the team operated as spies behind British lines. Jeremy was the son of Chester's Tory Mayor, who hid his political ideas behind a fa√ßade of disinterested pacifism. Elizabeth was a liberated woman ahead of her time, and Isak was an ex-slave. The brains of the group was Henry, a big fan of Benjamin Franklin (whom he resembled), and always able to invent whatever device or scheme the group needed to finish their missions.",
