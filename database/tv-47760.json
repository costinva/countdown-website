  "overview": "Beneath our feet, under trillions of tons of rock, lurk astonishing and deadly secrets. Earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions are all driven by hidden forces deep inside our planet. Now, using the latest scientific data from sensors and surface scans, we can x-ray the earth to reveal the dangers locked inside our planet. Using thousands of sensors and state-of-the-art surface scan information, we can create x-rays of the deep interior of our planet for the first time. From the churning interior to the oceans and life on land, view the world as it's never been seen before. Cutting-edge tools offer an inside look at Earth as it breathes, heals, and flexes its muscles inÂ X-Ray Earth.",
