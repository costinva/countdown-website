  "overview": "Consumer show which examines what we actually pay, and why or what for. How much does one minute call, a row of broken teeth, a lamppost or a kilo of cow? Based on audience questions, from a variety of issues, costs were identified by mathematician Stefan Stasse. With a large dose of humor, the financial motives of companies flawlessly are exposed and analyzed. Stasse collects all the information he gets offered from Sofie van den Enk, Ajouad El Miloudi and Sander de Kramer. They are continually on the move looking for the actual costs and economic motives of people and businesses.",
