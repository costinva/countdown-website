  "overview": "Takara belongs to the most prominent group in his class and is highly popular with the others, while Amagi is more quiet but is still bright, energetic and generally well-liked. Although they are classmates, the boys have no direct interaction with each other due to the differences in their peer groups, but in fact, both have surreptitiously become interested in the other. Realizing that their attraction may be love, Takara and Amagi decide to secretly date together without telling anyone else. However, Amagi, who is confused by Takara's mysterious lack of words and actions, is pushed to make an important decision.",
