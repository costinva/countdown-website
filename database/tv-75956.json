  "overview": "Young girl Luo Shu was sold to a brothel as her family went broke. However, because of her kindness and acumen, she earned the nickname \"Jinnang\". To change her life, she volunteered to assist the new county magistrate, Han Muzhi, in solving a major case. From then on, she temporarily stayed in the county office as a constable. During this time, she met Qi Menglin, a young nobleman who wanted to make a name in the martial world. Luo Shu was good at solving bizarre cases. As ten notorious murder cases took place one after another, including the gruesome \"Headless Woman Case\", the eerie \"Fenhe River Corpse Case\", and the treacherous \"Winery Murder Case\", Luo Shu and Qi Menglin did everything they could to bring justice to the helpless women involved. As they solved several cases together, Luo Shu and Qi Menglin started to have feelings for each other. In the meantime, however, a bigger conspiracy began to unfold.",
