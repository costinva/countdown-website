  "overview": "Saverio Barone, a young, ambitious and unscrupulous prosecutor, is going through an important life-shaping event: he has just become a member of the anti-mafia pool. The main objective of this recently created task force is to hunt down and capture the most dangerous mafia bosses. The pool has its headquarters in Palermo‘s Hall of Justice, where Saverio is about to enter for the first time. The same day, the two mafia bosses Leoluca Bagarella and Giovanni Brusca kidnap little Giuseppe Di Matteo, the son of a Mafioso who is collaborating with the law, revealing important Cupola secrets. This dramatic coincidence signals the beginning of an obsession that will torment Saverio‘s whole life: to bring that boy back home safely. After the landmark trial of 1987 that saw prosecuting magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino bring 360 mafiosi to justice, the Cosa Nostra counter-attacks. Italy explodes, and the sky turns black.",
