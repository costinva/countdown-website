  "overview": "Errol Flynn was probably spinning in his grave, but Mel Brooks's version of the antics of Robin Hood and his band of merry men is a laugh-getter. Though it's primarily a one-joke affair, Mel Brooks's brand of madness and a good cast, particularly Richard Dimitri playing the dual role of the foppish Bertram and a Chicago member of Robin's band called Renaldo, carry it off with all comedic stops pulled.",
