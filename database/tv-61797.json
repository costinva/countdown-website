  "overview": "Fifty-something Moutari Warra is a top law professor, teaching at the university of his adopted hometown, Tanasanga. He shares much of his private life with the rector Ganka Barry, their passion for horse-racing making them close friends. Through Ganka he meets Félicité, who becomes his wife and with whom he has a daughter, Didjé. At the university, the best students flock to his classes, drawn by his charisma and his specilisation in constitutional law. A special relationship develops between him and his best student, the young and bright Aïcha Diallo. But their professor-student relationship is not an easy one, beset as it is by a generational and conflictual mismatch.",
