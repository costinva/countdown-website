  "overview": "Get Arty is an original and funny ‘How To' art series hosted by a charismatic, relatable, enthusiastic family and a hilariously deadpan animated paint brush called Bristles. Follow real people, of all ages, on a journey to learn as much as they can about art. A contemporary twist on a traditional art show, Get Arty features an engaging and warm family at its heart, highlighting art that's both accessible and aspirational. The magazine format will include challenges for the whole family to take on together before judging each other's efforts, we'll visit artists around the UK to explain how they make their masterpieces and there will even be a Celebrity Draw Along where well-known celebrities demonstrate how to draw a unique picture for viewers to copy at home.",
