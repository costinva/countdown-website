  "overview": "It's time for a brand-new holiday season competition packed with tons of Christmas cheer! Five teams of cake masters and sugar artists face off in four jolly battles, creating mind-blowing, fantastical holiday displays that are as festive as they are delicious. In the Snowball Fight challenge, the competitors must use cake and sugar to create an edible holiday design in just 45 minutes. One winning team wins an advantage for the Winter Blizzard challenge, where they have to craft an eye-popping Christmas display made up entirely of cake and sugar. One team is eliminated after each battle, and in the end, one team will jingle all the way home with a $25,000 grand prize.",
