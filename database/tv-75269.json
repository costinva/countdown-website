  "overview": "Kim Minjae, a 21-year-old transfer student from Practical Music and a part-time worker, exudes a calm, meticulous, and thoughtful demeanor. His path continually intersects with Yoonchan's, whom he encountered by chance on his first day at the new school. Meanwhile, Lee Yoonchan, a 21-year-old Taekwondo major at Hankook University's College of Sports Culture and Arts, is introverted and somewhat clumsy, but his endearing silliness adds to his charm. A chance encounter between them leads to their paths intertwining, and over time, their bond deepens, blossoming into a romantic relationship.",
