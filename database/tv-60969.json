  "overview": "Award-winning pastry chef Stephanie Boswell shares her years of experience and expertise with failing bakery owners to help save real struggling businesses on the new series Bake or Break. Stephanie and her team focus on one crashing bakery and figure out how to completely makeover their business. To stop these pastry shops from bleeding money, she must freshen up stale recipes and revamp dingy storefronts, along with HGTV designers Lauren Makk and Breegan Jane, to get customers back in the door. Stephanie does not sugarcoat the truth from the bakery owners as she diagnoses their problems. But with her sharp eyes, razor wit and loving compassion, Stephanie can transform these battered pastry shops and burnt-out bakeries to gleaming showrooms filled with delicious sweets and vibrant, eye-popping desserts.",
