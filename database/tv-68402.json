  "overview": "BE@RBRICK is a music-driven comedy about young singer-songwriter Jasmine and her bandmates as they pursue their dreams and inspire others to do the same. But it won't be easy to do when living in a world where everyone's role is chosen for them and where the painted-on look you receive when you graduate from high school determines who you'll be for the rest of your life. Jasmine realizes that in order for her world to change, she and her friends may have to make it happen themselves.",
