  "overview": "Ringing an unknown doorbell has its share of surprises, risks, and adventures. This is the daily life of our six heroes. Six tireless sales reps who, all day long, reel off their spiel from landing to landing. Although their pitch is well-rehearsed, nothing ever goes as planned. The inhabitants of this very strange building lead them from absurd situation to absurd situation. Dring's troupe thus takes us into a Kafkaesque world where these salespeople discover to their cost that selling is truly a combat sport.",
