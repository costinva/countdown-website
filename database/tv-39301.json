  "overview": "A young uptown girl Masha agrees to the proposal of her beloved husband Max to start their own business and open an ostrich farm in a nearby village. The young couple moves from the loud, busy capital, into Max's grandmother's house, where he had spent his childhood. Will they be able to survive in the village? The couple's adventures are enriched through their interaction with the nosy neighbors — Vasyl and Liuba. Wise with life experience, they are hesitant to accept the newly-arrived couple into their community. They see them as something peculiar, but horribly interesting. The emotional dialogue between the village and the city breeds many comical misunderstandings and amusing incidents.",
