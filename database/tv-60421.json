  "overview": "An uncompromising story of a policewoman who will try to break the arrangement in which she was brought up. It is a story about an impossible love, about people who have to stand on \"two sides of the barricade\" and a tragic choice between feeling and a life of crime according to certain rules. A series that asks whether a person has the right to revenge when the judiciary is powerless?",
