  "overview": "On a school trip to a museum, Bo, her younger sister Jen, Vicky, Trix and Martin - five ordinary kids from London - are transported to an ancient Chinese Spirit World where they find themselves suddenly transformed into Spirit Warriors, each with their own unique spirit power. With the help of their mentor Shen, a Chinese water dragon, they must use their new-found skills to find 12 legendary spirit pieces before the evil warlord Li and his henchman Hwang can get their hands on them. If our heroes succeed they'll save the universe - and Bo's mum. If our heroes fail, the universe is doomed!",
