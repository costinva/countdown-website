  "overview": "La Ruta is the journey of a group of friends from El Perell√≥, from their farewell in a crowded Ruta Destroy, in 1993, until the day they entered Barraca for the first time, in 1981, when both they and \"the party\" they still preserved their innocence. La Ruta recounts the more than ten years that Valencia spent dancing, a few years that we would all like to live and that only a few can remember.",
