  "overview": "Mesut Süre, which has drawn a unique and pioneering path both in the world of humor and in the field of talk shows! Mesut Süre talks to the lonely, about loneliness, the reasons for loneliness, whether loneliness is \"sultanism\" or \"desperation\", over the loneliness of his guests - in his own words - \"making people laugh like a bear\". Every week, three consonant(!) names are guests on Mesut's stage. Faced with three loners, Mesut scrutinizes his guests' stories of loneliness (for example, unsuccessful flirtations, abandonment, deception, etc.)",
