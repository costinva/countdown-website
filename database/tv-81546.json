  "overview": "Each summer on Cape Cod, multi-generational fishing families race against the clock - and each other - to catch highly valuable Atlantic bluefin tuna using only 10-foot electrified spears. Time is of the essence as harpoon boats only have four weeks to catch as many fish as they can before the overall limit is met. With fish worth as much as $10K each, stakes are high for these expert fishermen to make ends meet for their families and beat the competition to take home these prize fish.",
