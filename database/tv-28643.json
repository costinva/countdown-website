  "overview": "The Chillenden Murders is a 2-part documentary examining the brutal killings of Lin Russell and her daughter Megan, along with the attempted murder of 9-year-old Josie in 1996. Known as the Chillenden murders, they led to one of the biggest manhunts ever undertaken by British police. Michael Stone, a local heroin addict and petty criminal, was arrested, charged and sentenced to life imprisonment. Now, with exclusive access to the vast collection of original case files, a team of independent experts has come together to re-examine the evidence. With backgrounds in policing, forensics, law and criminology, they attempt to shed new light on the case and uncover the truth, whatever it may turn out to be.",
