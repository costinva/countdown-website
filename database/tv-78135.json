  "overview": "In the mid-1980s, childhood sweethearts Wang Xiaoqing and Du Mantang were separated by Wang Xiaoqing's mother's disapproval. Zhang Zezhong seized the opportunity, but later married the vice principal's daughter for his career. When his social climbing failed and his house was nearly ruined from a failed scheme to inflate its price, he ended up disgraced. Thirty years later, both Du Mantang and Zhang Zezhong work as the managers in a neighborhood. Zhang Zezhong tries to profit from the neighborhood decommercialization, but Du Mantang blocks his plans. Zhang Zezhong's scheme to take over a traditional courtyard under false pretenses is thwarted by the community, leading to his arrest. His daughter Zhang Ting pleads for understanding, revealing his actions were driven by a desire to stop his wife from emigrating. Although forgiven by his neighbors, Zhang Zezhong receives a prison sentence with probation. He later sincerely apologizes and is ultimately forgiven by the neighbors.",
