  "overview": "After being reincarnated, Ars Louvent is supposed to live in a different world as a weak aristocrat. Both his physical strength and intelligence were mediocre in both worlds, but here he naturally possessed a skill called \"Appraisal\" that allowed him to see the potential of any person. By gathering talented people by his side, Ars uses this \"Appraisal\" skill to transform his weak territory into the strongest one! But the road ahead of him won't be so simple.",
