  "overview": "Police Major Polina Levashova's husband, who was collecting compromising materials against high-ranking officials, is being killed. Now Polina herself is in a high-risk zone, since the criminals are sure that all the information collected by the murdered man is stored with her. Polina, having changed her last name, leaves for a provincial town to hide from intruders. In her new position, she will have to take over the police department and earn the trust of her colleagues, who at first cannot believe that such a fragile girl can be their incredibly steadfast boss with iron nerves. In addition, she will have to protect her family from those who are sure that Polina knows a lot more than she says.",
