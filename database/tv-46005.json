  "overview": "Viewpoint follows a police surveillance investigation into a tight-knit Manchester community and explores whether it is ever possible to observe the lives of others with true objectivity and zero effect.When beloved primary school teacher Gemma Hillman vanishes into thin air, DC Martin King decides to set up his observation post in the home of single mum Zoe Sterling. His reasoning is simple—Zoe's flat commands a panoramic view of all the comings and goings in Westbury Square. More specifically, he can see straight into the flat that Gemma shares with boyfriend Greg Sullivan—the prime suspect in her disappearance. But Martin is a man carrying his own burden of trauma and guilt and he starts to question if he can trust what he observes?  Could he be projecting his own loneliness and remorse onto the ostracised Greg?",
