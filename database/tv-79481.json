  "overview": "Münevver Hanım, who comes from a noble family, lives with her veteran maid Suzan in her mansion, which is still ostentatious despite its age. One night, a little girl left at the door of the mansion by her older sister will completely change not only Münevver's life but also the lives of many others. Little Mine is Münevver's granddaughter, whose existence Münevver is unaware of. Mrs. Münevver is surprised to see the necklace around Mine's neck and goes in search of her daughter, who has not called her for years. There are so many secrets and such a murder that when these are revealed, the lives of many people, including Münevver, will be turned upside down, orders will be disrupted, homes will fall apart, and nothing will ever be the same again.",
