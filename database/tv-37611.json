  "overview": "Ling Ling Qi is a sincere, kind girl who's always happy to lend a hand to others, but she also has low self-esteem, which has severely impacted her life, making her unable to do her best at work and fulfill her dreams. She's also afraid to express her feelings for her colleague that she's been harbouring a crush on, Bo Hai. Bo Hai is a high-tech CEO and a floriculture expert who has high IQ but low EQ. One day, Ling Ling Qi and Bo Hai take part in a company's high tech experimental bracelet test to improve sleeping patterns. During the test, the bracelet malfunctions, leading Ling Ling Qi's electro brain waves to be keyed into Bo Hai's dream sequence, which allowed Ling Ling Qi to enter Bo Hai's dreams. Drama focuses on how the two characters help each other fix their own personal problems within their dreams and real lives.",
