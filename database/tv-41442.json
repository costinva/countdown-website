  "overview": "Hitler's Most Wanted presents a new perspective on how and why a generation of men and women living in a European society became the leaders of one of the most terrifying regimes of all time, responsible for 60 million deaths. Visiting the places where elite Nazi leaders grew up and the sites of their worst atrocities, James Ellis, a dedicated young historian, explores the defining moments which transformed everyday Germans into mass murderers.As knowledge of the origins of the Third Reich recedes, it's time for a new generation to scrutinize the key war criminals involved to understand what happened and ensure that the lessons of the past are never forgotten.",
