  "overview": "Are you ready to be scared out of your mind? Join us in a place where your senses may betray you; a place where reality is not exactly what it seems; a place where you'll question everything you've ever known to be true. Welcome to Room 401. What happens inside appears to be very real to the people it's happening to, and the fear they feel is also very real. Now, the only question is: Are you ready to step into another dimension and face what's inside Room 401? Room 401 is a mind-blowing journey through the weird and shocking world of illusion. Unsuspecting victims are swept into the middle of a real-life horror movie that's playing out right in front of their eyes. From the dead rising from the grave to messy chainsaw mishaps to electrifying salon encounters, these onlookers won't believe what they're seeing. Or will they?",
