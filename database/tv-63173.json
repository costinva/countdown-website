  "overview": "Scotland's Greatest Escape takes audiences on a journey to the very best escapes that Scotland has to offer and ultimately crown one as Scotland's Greatest Escape.Â Across the series a wide variety of holiday styles and destinations available across Scotland will be showcased. With the emphasis on exceptionality and not luxury, all budgets will be catered for. From wellness retreats to adrenalin fuelled activity breaks, romantic getaways to family fun, each episode will showcase the top three destinations in their category and be road-tested by a family or group of friends with a passion for that particular holiday style. They will spend one night at each of the shortlisted destinations and be tasked to judge five specific elements of their stay. The holiday with the highest score goes forward to the grand final.Once all finalists are selected, an industry panel, featuring some of Scotland's most experienced and renowned hospitality and tourism experts, will judge against strict industry standards. They will deliberate which of the finalists is most deserving of the award and present the title at the grand final which will be filmed at a prestigious Scottish location.",
