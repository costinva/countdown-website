  "overview": "Dr. Slump is a very funny anime, based off the first best selling manga of Akira Toriyama, the creator of the world-famous Dragon Ball Z. The story begins when Dr. Senbei Norimaki, a.k.a. Dr. Slump, the fat, stubby legged 'genius' creates the perfect human android, who is later named Arale Norimaki. Arale makes many friends, such as Akane Kimadori, a trouble making 8th grader, and her cousins Taro, a high school drop out, and his little brother Peasuke Soramame. The humor is best suited for those over the age of 13, as there are a few suggestive themes, as well as underage smoking and slight alcohol consumption.",
