Everyone in town knows the legend of the Mistress of the Mountain-the former owner of the local emerald mines, the green-eyed Princess Tumanova. When the bloody years of the revolution caught up to the Princess, she hid away a secret box full of the rarest Ural emeralds. Even torture couldn't make Princess Tumanova give up the location of her treasure, and she cursed anyone who dared to lay their hands on it. The gems awaken greed in people, and no heart can resist their temptations. People fear to speak her name, lest it bring disaster upon them. But one local girl, the beautiful Alenka, dares to challenge the Mistress of the Mountain. Alenka calls to her, 'Give me your precious gems!' The same day, Alenka's father discovers the princess's box deep in the underground mines - That moment changes the lives of Alenka, her family and the whole town",
