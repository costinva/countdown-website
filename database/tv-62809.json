  "overview": "The story of a house spanning several decades. The stories of those who inhabited and occasionally step on that place, from the present to the past. A pending matter that manifests and disturbs. This series shows in five discontinued events and in inverse chronological time the revenge of a supernatural entity whose pattern of action is sinister and terrifying. The plot invites a journey as dizzying as it is horrifying and the viewer will have no choice but to discover the true cause and the dark origin of this evil.",
