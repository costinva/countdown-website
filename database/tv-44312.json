They've lost 43 games in a row--a five-year losing streak--and they're just 5 losses away from owning the worst losing streak in state history. But the football team is sick of being kicked around. The cheerleaders are finished being taunted. This year everything is going to change. The kids from Lincoln Park are on a mission to do what nobody thinks they can: win. The series follows one season of football the team's players, cheerleaders, parents and fans embark on a journey to turn their lives around. From dating relationships to social struggles and family drama, they deal with the growing pains of high school while uniting first as friends, then as a team, and finally as a school hoping to start new legacy at Lincoln Park.",
