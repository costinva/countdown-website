  "overview": "Imagine a life where we are never distracted and have time for everything. Where we work as we always dreamed of, and if we get tired of it, we go back to school. Where we don't just eat to satisfy our hunger, but experience vivid impressions from food. Where casual acquaintances and deep relationships on social networks harmoniously form a diverse social circle. Where the center is not the main place in the city, but the entire city becomes the center of life. In fact, this life is already around us. Which means we can stop imagining it and just start living.",
