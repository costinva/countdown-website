  "overview": "Daniel Henderson was an LA cop who made a living by putting on a uniform every day and going to work for the vice squad until tragedy struck and his wife was killed in a freak Greenpeace accident. Feeling lost and left alone to raise his teenage son, Atticus, Henderson takes up the job of sheriff of Manhattan, AZ, a town so small it's not even on the map. Once in Manhattan, Henderson is confronted by the town's mayor, Jake Manhattan, who had stretched the truth a little about the town and Henderson's role in it. Henderson quickly finds he has his hands full with a town full of eccentrics being led by the strangest of them all, Mayor Manhattan.",
