  "overview": "A successful team of hackers from Russia considers themselves noble robbers: it costs them nothing to get into the wallet of another businessman and deprive him of a large sum of money. They don't know each other, but after the next operation goes wrong, the hackers have to meet in reality. Their identities have been revealed, and a real, not virtual, prison sentence looms on the horizon. But they have a choice: go to jail or start working for the Russian special services. The guys do not want to be deprived of their freedom and decide to work for the good of the country and the whole world. It's only within the group that the struggle for leadership begins, and soon it becomes clear that one of the participants is cooperating with the enemy.",
