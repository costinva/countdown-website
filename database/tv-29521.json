  "overview": "It's not always the police cars or ambulances that get to incidents first; it's the men – and women – on motorbikes. Meet the frontline heroes of Britain's emergency services as we follow West Midland's Ambulance Service biker paramedics and Essex police biker cops, and enter the world of those who daily risk their lives to save ours.",
