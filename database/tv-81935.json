  "overview": "Yuzuhara Miku is a temporary employee who works for a reception desk at a department store. She has low self confidence and worries about what others think of her, but is clueless when it comes to makeup. Her elite lawyer boyfriend Haruhisa however, constantly tells her she he prefers seeing her that way, so she wore minimal makeup because he favors her \"modest\" look. One day, she meets Takakura Eve, a guy with a special love for makeup. When he applied red lipstick on her, Miku felt a sense of exhilaration. However, when Haruhisa found out about this, he transforms into an emotionally abusive man.",
