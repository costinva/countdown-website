  "overview": "A look back at some of the best and unseen moments from the history of Britain's longest running soap opera Coronation Street. The first episode is called The Headline Makers and focuses on some of the highest profile storylines from the shows history including an infamous storyline that was never broadcast at the time because of a press outcry, this is about Sheila Birtles way back in 1963 and her attempted suicide. This would have been seen as absolutley shocking at the time so it's easy to see why Granada were uneasy about showing it. Also on the episode is the Weatherfield One plot which saw Deirdre jailed for crimes she did not commit after falling for a conman. Her prison sentence sparked a media frenzy and even MPs discussed the miscarriage of justice. There is also a look at Sarah-Louise Platt's teenage pregnancy storyline, which was praised by government ministers for raising the issue. Plus the show covers Deirdre Barlow's affair with Mike Baldwin, which inspired many column inches and public polls on Deirdre's dilemma, and Sally Webster's devastating breast cancer diagnosis, which she revealed to her husband Kevin as he was about to tell her that he was leaving her for another woman. Narrated by David Morrissey and featuring contributions from the likes of Ken Barlow and Anne Kirkbride.",
