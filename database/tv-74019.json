  "overview": "Sasha, who lost her parents early, always wanted to become a landscape designer. But her dream did not come true — the nominal scholarship that the girl studied for was withdrawn without explanation, and Sasha lost the chance to continue her studies. The company covering the scholarship is run by a young and talented architect Sergey Gradsky, who recently broke up with a girl and found out that the ex was going to get married. Sasha decides to deal with the businessman who ruined her dream. Their meeting turns into a series of curious situations, as a result of which Sasha and Sergey agree to pose as a couple in love for two months so that Sergei gets back together with his ex, and Sasha can return to university.",
