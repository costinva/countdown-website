  "overview": "In the all-new Mud Mountain Haulers, bigger paydays beckon men to risk it all in the kilometre-high Cariboo Mountains of B.C. This character-driven docu-series focuses on one of the most dangerous jobs on land - logging and log hauling - and no one is willing to go steeper or higher than third-generation loggers Craig and Brent Lebeau and their crews. For a decade, the two brothers were at loggerheads, unwilling to cede an inch or a machine to the other. But wicked weather, a series of setbacks, and a declining industry have forced the Lebeau brothers to bury the axe and work together.",
