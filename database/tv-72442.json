  "overview": "Bradley Walsh has been at the forefront of British comedy for the last 40 years and during that time he's met and been inspired by some of the world's greatest comedy legends. In this series, Bradley celebrates these comedy heroes and heroines, reflecting on their work and the joy and laughter they brought.   From sitcoms to stand ups to double acts, Bradley sets out his all time comedy legends and puts forward his own theory as to why they are the best of all time. Throughout the series Bradley interviews friends such as Alexander Armstrong, Omid Djalili, Jo Brand, Stephen K Amos, Su Pollard, Alison Steadman and Les Dennis and others to unravel the genius of the comedy greats - from Tommy Cooper, Lee Mack and Victoria Wood to Bob Monkhouse, Little and Large and Morecambe &amp; Wise; and revisits classic comedy moments of sitcoms from Hi Di Hi and Dad's Army to Blackadder and Absolutely Fabulous. This is Bradley Walsh's insider take on his comedy legends.",
