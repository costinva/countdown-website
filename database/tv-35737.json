  "overview": "Cyril, Misha and Anton are friends from school. Once they dreamed of becoming travelers and the three of them traveling the whole world, but life was ordered differently. The good-natured hefty Misha graduated from the medical institute and became one of the best pediatricians of the city, Anton turned out to be a boring computer genius with a tattered beard and a lot of bad habits, while Cyril now works as the editor-in-chief of the glossy men's magazine. Companions of life in our heroes are absent for various reasons. But fate decides to test the strength and friendship of the heroes, and their attitudes. Misha once invited to participate in the morning telecast - and in the person of the host Sony, he unexpectedly meets his second half. Misha does not dare to introduce his friends to his chosen one, which causes Sonya to be suspicious. Suffering in silence is not Sunny's style, so one day she arranges a surprise for Misha and his friends, unexpectedly appearing at their meeting.",
