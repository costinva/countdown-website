  "overview": "After the funeral of the head of the family, the oligarch's family wanted to start dividing the inheritance. However, all the money ended up abroad in password-protected accounts. The relatives of the deceased rich man thought that he could leave most of the inheritance to an illegitimate daughter who lives in the outback. It turned out that she works as the deputy head of the colony. In an attempt to extort an inheritance, they set fire to their relative's house, but eventually get a term in the colony, where their father's illegitimate daughter works.",
