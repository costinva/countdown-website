  "overview": "Each episode of Amy Dowden's Dare to Dance will see an individual or group perform a spectacular dance routine, choreographed by Caerphilly-born Amy, to surprise family and friends.Behind each dance will be a story: a big life moment or message someone wants to give. It could be someone who wants a unique way to propose, a dancer who feared they'd never dance again or a group of friends who need an unforgettable way to say thanks. No matter if her new student loves to dance or is petrified, Amy's ready to help them master the routine to blow friends and family away.",
