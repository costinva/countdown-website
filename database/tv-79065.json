  "overview": "The assassination of Julius Caesar plunged Rome into chaos, leading to the rise of one of history's most notorious and scandal-ridden dynasties. Over the next century, this twisted and incestuous family relentlessly pursued power, establishing the world's first hereditary dictatorship. For the first time in history women altered the Western World and the puppet master behind these power games was one ruthless woman, Livia Drusilla, the wife of Augustus and matriarch of the Caesar clan. This arch manipulator will go to any length to ensure the survival of her dynasty.  Told through the eyes of Livia Druisilla, Emperor: The Rise &amp; Fall of a Dynasty will narrate the saga of five power-hungry rulers - Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero - each embroiled in a brutal struggle for supremacy, driven by the primal urges of sex and violence. ",
