  "overview": "Battle in the Box sees pairs of comics and some of the nation's favourite celebrities battle it out for pride, prizes and most importantly floorspace, in this comedy entertainment and reality hybrid. The eight-episode series comprises four tense double bills which sees eight pairs spend 24 hours in the box.When the clock starts two celebrity teams move into a completely empty box divided by a moveable wall with nothing but a toothbrush. Once inside, they will only have cameras and each other for company - no beds, tables, chairs or home comforts. Over the course of the day and night, they need to earn everything by winning a series of physical and mental challenges all set by the orchestrator of this chaos, Jimmy Carr. Winning a game means more space and luxuries for the lucky duo. But there's a catch: more room for one team means less for the losers, as the Box's sliding wall forces them into an ever-smaller space. And, with games set around the clock, the tide - and the wall - can turn at any time.",
