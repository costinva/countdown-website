  "overview": "A suspenseful, high-energy mix of pop culture trivia, strategy and simple whirling luck, Spin the Wheel pits contestants against a colossal, spinning 40-foot wheel that holds incredible sums of cash prizes in its rotation. Throughout the game, players will answer trivia questions â€“ each correct answer adds more extreme amounts of cash in the wheel's wedges in a strategic location of their choice, while each incorrect answer adds more dangerous wedges that could instantly bring their total back to zero. With massive prize money on the line, contestants must make sweat-inducing, gut-wrenching decisions: whether to walk away or risk it all to Spin the Wheel one last time.",
