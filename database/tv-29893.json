  "overview": "This set brings together three television plays from multi-award-winning comedienne and writer Victoria Wood. Originally transmitted between 1979 and 1981, the plays provided an early showcase for the bittersweet, distinctly Northern humour and mastery of dourly comic,sometimes poignant dialogue that has made her one of Britain's best-loved and most consistently successful performers. Included is the highly acclaimed Talent, commissioned in 1978 by the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield and the play which first brought Victoria Wood to the attention of Granada Television; the productions also reunited Wood and long-time friend Julie Walters, and marked the beginning of their phenomenally successful television partnership. Wood and Walters stalwart Duncan Preston also appears in all three plays, with turns from Tracey Ullman, George Costigan and stand-up veteran and Bullseye host Jim Bowe.",
