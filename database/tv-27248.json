  "overview": "Farmers' Market Flip is a deliciously action-packed half-hour cooking competition that puts two teams of chefs' culinary skills to the ultimate test, as they face off to see who can produce the most crowd-pleasing dishes over one lightning-fast day! First, it's the Flavor of the Market challenge - the teams must create a dish that highlights a vendor's star ingredient. Then, the teams get only 20 minutes to race through the farmers' market to buy ultra-fresh ingredients. They'll set-up shop in the Farmers' Market Flip pop-up kitchen, where they'll have one hour to prepare gourmet delights that will be sampled and judged by hungry customers at the market. When time's up, the team that wins over the most palates will take the prize -- and even some serious culinary cred!",
