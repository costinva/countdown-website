A new project \"One Day in the City\" has started on the TV channel \"My Planet\".The hosts of the program, Zoya Berber and Diana Jalalova, offer the viewer a short but comprehensive guide to the main cities of the world, from which it is possible to learn how in just one day to understand the essence of the city and visit its most unusual and secret places.The goal of the new project is to show that travel, even the smallest, is a great opportunity that you need to be able to take advantage of.The presenters have one day to see and tell the audience about the most important elements of a big city: sights, parks, museums, restaurants, markets ...The \"One Day in the City\" project proves that if you plan your time correctly, then even in a metropolis you can see all those places that are commonly called must-see. And most importantly, the hosts of \"My Planet\" will find and show the audience authentic corners \"for their own.\" An equally important element of the program will be life hacks - advice on where to live in the city, how to move around it, how to spend money sparingly.The slogan of the new project is \"The whole city is not enough\".",
