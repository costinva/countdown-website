  "overview": "Ráth Chairn is located in the southeast of the Boyne Valley, between Trim and Athboy in County Meath. This Gaeltacht area was founded in 1935, when a courageous group from Connemara moved east to create a better life for themselves. In this series, we will get an insight into what drives this vibrant and creative community, the aspects of life that are most important to them, and how they preserve their traditions in the beautiful Ráth Chairn.",
