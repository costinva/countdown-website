  "overview": "After spending 25 years in England, Miss Sophie Mayerhofer has brought the best of it back home to Germany with her, including her British car and the classic English flair for solving crimes by deduction and intuition. She and her childhood friend, Father Anselm, are going to stick their noses into the local police investigations whether the chief inspector - her brother - likes it or not.",
