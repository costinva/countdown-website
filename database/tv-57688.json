  "overview": "Now more than ever, ordinary people are choosing unconventional paths to justice. With police departments in turmoil and the role of law enforcement in question, citizens are hiring private investigators to find the answers they need. Missing persons, infidelities, cold cases and fraud fill their notebooks. Secrets, Lies and Private Eyes follows four teams of PIs as they tackle these cases. Their role is exacting and yet deeply fulfilling. Their clients are desperate, troubled, and sometimes wacky, but their purpose is clear - to find the truth whatever it takes. Cops are no longer the only way to separate right from wrong. The PI is back.",
