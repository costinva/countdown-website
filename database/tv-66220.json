Ye Luo and Cang Lan Ye fought their wits and courage around the contract, and gradually got to know and fell in love with each other in the process of forming an alliance. However, Cang Lan Ye decided to stay away from Ye Luo in order to prevent the half-demon force from getting out of control due to the contract, suppressing the out-of-control force. The relationship between the two also ushered in a new crisis.",
