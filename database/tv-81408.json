According to the plot, the young director Vitka dreams of making a cool movie and getting on international festivals. But all plans are destroyed by a full-scale invasion, and now he has to reconsider his values. Shortly before the events, he meets the activist Oleksa, with whom he falls in love. The girl goes to the front, and in search of her, Vitka first starts volunteering, and later finds himself in the squad of the Ukrainian commander Chumak. Here he learns new skills: from holding a weapon to operating a drone, and becomes a participant in an important operation that puts the dots on the \"i\" in the long-standing confrontation between Ukrainian and Russian officers.",
