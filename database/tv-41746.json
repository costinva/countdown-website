  "overview": "Somewhere in Saskatchewan seven very different animal contestants share a mansion in this animated parody of the reality show Big Brother. The residents include a loud-mouthed orangutan, a Canadian pig, an alcoholic Russian bear, a rapping penguin, a gay crocodile, a Jamaican panther and an overweight panda. They compete in a variety of challenges to avoid extinction, although once they've been eliminated they continue to appear in episodes. The show is hosted by a vulture named Claude, though he is replaced by tough cookie Bobbie.",
