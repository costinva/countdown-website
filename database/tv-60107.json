  "overview": "Summer of 1937. The dictatorial regime reaches its peak. The continued repression leads to the creation of an exile camp in Cape Verde – Portuguese colony – where the main opposition leaders are kept. It is in this context that a portentous bomb attack against Salazar is launched. But a miscalculation frustrates the attack on the President of the Council. Who, wanted Salazar dead after all?",
