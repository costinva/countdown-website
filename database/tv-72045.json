  "overview": "Inspired by Hasbro's iconic childhood toy, \"Lincoln Log Masters\" follows Cody, Wilson and the Knaughty Log Homes crew -- the only log home building company with the Lincoln Log stamp of approval -- as they design, build, break down, and rebuild epic log homes and structures across Oregon. Challenges abound for the KLH crew as they battle tight budgets, short timelines and the worst Mother Nature can throw at them. However, this team handles setbacks and successes with healthy doses of laughter and fun.",
