  "overview": "Set in a small town in South India, before the internet &amp; mobiles, the series is a nostalgic ride about imagination, adventures and the magic of childhood. A little boy from a railway colony strives to bring his modest family a modicum of glory through highly fanciful means while constantly being brought back to reality by his level-headed father.
