  "overview": "Does ending up under TSO (Compulsory Health Treatment) for seven days mean being crazy? This is what Daniele asks himself. Daniele is a twenty-year-old with a great sensitivity, who after a psychotic crisis wakes up in the dormitory of a psychiatric ward. There he finds himself with five unlikely roommates with whom he thinks he has nothing in common, pressured by doctors who they want to rummage in his brain, and looked after by nurses who seem cynical and disinterested. But seven days are long and what at first seemed like a sentence gradually turns into one of the most intense and formative experiences of his life.Tutto chiede salvezza (Everything Calls for Salvation) is loosely based on the acclaimed novel of the same name by Daniele Mencarelli.",
