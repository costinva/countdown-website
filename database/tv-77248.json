  "overview": "In Scariest House in America, HGTV will expand on the popular format, adding special spine-tingling elements that embrace the spirit of Halloween. During three frightfully fun, half-hour episodes, Retta will travel to homes in various U.S. regions, including the Spooky South, Nightmare Northeast and Mysterious Midwest, where she will tour terrifying properties that owners say are haunted by scary stories and hair-raising sights. The home deemed the \"scariest\" of them all will also get a renovation revival by designer Alison Victoria in a one-hour season finale episode.",
