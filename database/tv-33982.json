  "overview": "Forget Jenny from the block… wait ‘til you see how Jenny from Accounts moves! It's time to \"get down\" to business with Dance Boss – a brand-new TV dance competition where the best workplace crews battle it out to win a cash prize of $100,000. Inspired by viral videos shared millions of times around the world, this new shiny floor format sees 10 Australian workplaces put forward their best five amateur dancers. These dance troupes are then put through their paces by a world-famous choreographer. In each episode, the dazzlingly costumed crews face off in spectacularly staged dance battles. They are judged and scored by three big name celebrities who will base their scores on entertainment factor alone. Eventually 10 will be whittled down to one winning troupe who will be crowned \"Dance Boss Australia\"!",
