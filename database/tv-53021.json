  "overview": "Dr. Ole Alcumbrac owns White Mountain Animal Hospital, a full-service animal clinic in Pinetop, Arizona, that cares for everything from cats and dogs to exotics and large animals. But this self-described 'wild man' isn't your typical veterinarian, and it's his work outside of the clinic that excites him most.",
