  "overview": "In the ordinary part of the city, there is an average and in no way exceptional grammar school. It is attended by students who will continue their studies, but also those who do not have it and will eventually have to transfer to an industrial school or an apprentice. Children from richer parents from the area come here because they are close, but also students from worse neighborhoods and poorer conditions. Sometimes it's even pretty rough when two hot heads meetâ€¦ Most of the time, however, in the best sense of the word, it's a completely normal gym. Except for one professor.",
