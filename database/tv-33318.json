  "overview": "22 year old Marnie is not OK. She may just seem quiet to others, but the noise inside her head is relentless. For the last 2031 days, she has been assailed by an incessant barrage of graphic x-rated thoughts that intrude, at the most inopportune of moments, on her day to day life. Whether she's sitting exams at university, waiting at a bus stop or passing strangers on a street, her life is interrupted by irrepressible sexual thoughts. Marnie has no idea what's wrong with her - Is she gay? A sex addict?? A pervert??? Why is she plagued by these mental images and what do they mean? Is that who she really is, deep down?Pure is painfully human, sharply observed, and outrageously funny adaptation of Rose Bret√©cher's acclaimed book. It is a moving, warm and truthful exploration of one young woman's search for herself and her very real struggle with mental illness. It explores what it means to be a young woman today, what it means to discover a whole new world. It's about finding new friends, and most importantly, about falling in love.",
