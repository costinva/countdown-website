  "overview": "On April 23, 1945, the U.S. Navy warship USS Eagle 56 exploded off the coast of Portland, Maine due to a malfunction of the ship's boilers...or so the official report said. For decades, questions and confusion about the tragedy have plagued its survivors and their families. Some believe the sinking was actually the result of an attack by a rogue German U-boat. A civilian-led dive expedition attempts to discover the lost wreckage and find out what really happened, uncovering fresh clues, startling eyewitness accounts, and a possible cover-up.",
