How To Live Younger is an exciting 3-part series that looks at the scientific ‘hacks' that can help improve our lives; cutting through the ‘wellness' hype, revealing rigorous and robust scientific research that shows how we can prolong our time on earth.In the past, if we were fortunate we might live until 80 years of age - but anticipating that the last 15 years might involve a slow, unavoidable deterioration. Now scientists believe that we can increase our ‘healthspan' to live more active, healthy and enjoyable years. Remarkably, many of the ‘diseases of ageing', such as heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes and depression, could in fact be preventable.",
