  "overview": "It's a movement that's sweeping the world – ‘going tiny' as people trade in space for simplicity. And now Australians are embracing small too as Andrew Winter discovers in this intriguing local series, Tiny House Australia. In a country like Australia where homes are among the largest in the world, with an average house coming in at 243 square metres, tiny houses – with some measuring just 10 square metres – are proving that size doesn't matter, it's creativity that counts. Starting with de-cluttering your life and ending with the simplicity of living in a smart, creative space, the tiny house trend started more as an environmental one before people started realising its other benefits like huge economic and time freedom. Tiny House Australia is an eight-part series that follows real prospective homebuyers on a quest to find their mini dream home. But even though these homes are small in stature, the challenges of finding the perfect mini-home are as big as any real estate hunt. With three homes to choose from in each 30 minute episode, our buyers will have a tough choice deciding which small space to go for because picking the right one is the their next big decision. ",
