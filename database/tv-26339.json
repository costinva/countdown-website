  "overview": "The irrepressible Mim celebrates turning 70 by writing a bucket list. Item one: dragging daughter Fran on the \"mini break they never had\".The mother and daughter spend a tense weekend at Miniworld, a dated theme-park which Fran had been desperate to visit 30 years ago. When Fran tries to leave, Mim reveals she's dying. Fran tries to make the effort, but new starts and openness are easier said than done.Mim is an eccentric free spirit who believes 70 is the new 40. Fran (Frog Stone) is a reserved high school history teacher in a rut. They are also mother and daughter, and their relationship is not exactly easy. When Mim reveals she is dying and wants to go on a trip to fulfil items on her bucket list, Fran feels that she has no choice but to come along for the ride. Fran and Mim have to try to come to terms with their past and their future as they tick off items on Mim's preposterous list, one by one.",
