  "overview": "Rolling In It Philippines is a game where three contestants are each paired up with a celebrity to answer general knowledge questions but first, they must roll a coin down a giant arcade board to find out how much each question is worth. In this game of chance, where the coin lands could mean the difference between winning a large sum of money or losing it all in a heartbeat. In nail-biting scenes, contestants and viewers hold their breath to see which way the coin will go. Players may win, go bankrupt, or get to steal another team's cash.",
