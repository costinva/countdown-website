  "overview": "Funny You Should Ask is an outrageous game show that believes every question always has a funny answer. In each half hour episode, six superstar comedians try to help two contestants win a big cash prize. The celebrity is asked an interesting trivia based question and responds with a killer joke. After the laughter subsides, the comedian answers again, this time trying to respond correctly. The contestant must then decide if he thinks the comedian's answer is right or wrong. After three laugh filled rounds, the contestant with the most money goes on to play the end game for a chance at the big cash prize. Every episode is jam-packed with more laughter than any of today's hottest sitcoms.",
