  "overview": "Super Heists cracks open the case files of master thieves, examining their crimes from two distinct, yet parallel points of view: the masterminds themselves and the investigators who doggedly pursue them. Whether it's the huge bankrolls that fund these heists or the thieves' mad dash to stash their loot, investigators know that the best way to solve the case is to follow the money.",
