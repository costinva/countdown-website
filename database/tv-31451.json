  "overview": "A westernized Irish adoptee, Joong Ah inevitably flies back to Korea to confront her past and to see the country she is really from, only to fall in love with her brother, Jae Bok. Their love is painful, as they are never meant to be together as lovers, but merely as brother and sister. The show's message is that there is no such thing as noble innocent love and that love is adversity itself. Therefore, love mustn't be impeded by so-called \"destiny\" or family, no matter how ironic or difficult the case may seem. Although destiny is cruel and arduous, the two young lovers radiate pure happiness. The show describes how love survives the tragic bondage of family, destiny and romance.",
