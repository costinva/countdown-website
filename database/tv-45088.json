  "overview": "Vir Das travels across India with his friends to answer the question: \"What does India find funny?\" In Patiala, they explore comedy and clich√©s. In Lucknow, the hasya kavis give a masterclass. In Jodhpur, the city welcomes new jesters. In Mysore, a Mysore joke is written. In Kumarakom, comedy after tragedy is explored. In Leh, even the people in the harshest region of the country laugh.",
