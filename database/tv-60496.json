  "overview": "The beauty blogger Si Yan has mistakenly entered the VR system of an ancient Chinese-style beauty game. Much to her surprise, she is assigned the role of a low-level dressing maid. Don't they know who she is?! With her superb make-up skills, solid product knowledge and accomplished technique, Si Yan soon became a successful online influencer. Her engaging manner had easily won the favour of her female audience. Now fully entrenched in the past, she recognizes that behind these beautiful faces hides the same joyful or painful stories she had left behind in the modern world. And there Si Yan had stuck to her game plan, focusing only on her business strategies, making for a rather pathetic love life. She refused to compromise for any man. But this ancient world is offering her an embarrassment of riches in the variety of men she encounters. It's all so tempting! Will she open up her heart and give love its equal time?Â ",
