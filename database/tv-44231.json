  "overview": "Solving murders inside the Amish community is unlike solving any other kind of criminal case. These closed communities are pious, principled and notoriously distrustful of the outside world. Murder in Amish Country uncovers some of the most heinous crimes committed by seemingly moral subjects, and reveals that what happens in the dark.. eventually comes to light.",
