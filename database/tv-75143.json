  "overview": "With exclusive access to Basildon University Hospital, part of Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, The Young Midwives of Essex will offer a unique insight into the life of the junior midwives in a way that you've never seen before. The series will blend documentary and reality techniques to bring a fresh approach to the genre, while also using social media to help frame the narratives.The dynamic cast - a tightknit group - will be made up of a mixture of student midwives, their teachers, and newly qualified midwives, following their early-starts and 12-hour shifts, through to their home lives and evenings out together. Midwives are able to qualify after just three years, making them some of the youngest medical professionals in Britain.",
