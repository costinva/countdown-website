  "overview": "Ten drag queens from Germany, Austria and Switzerland are moving into a luxury villa in Los Angeles and are staging a variety show week after week in which they present themselves in all their facets: sometimes ladylike, sometimes something cheeky, sometimes touching. ProSieben accompanies the ten ladies on their way and gives viewers a look behind the scenes of the drag world: Who are the personalities behind the pompous costumes? What characterizes a \"Queen of Drags\"? How do the men turn into extroverted glamor ladies who take their breath away from the studio audience with their versatile talents? And how do they live together in their villa?",
