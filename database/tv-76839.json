  "overview": "After 25 years on the screen, Wenche Andersen has this year got her own Christmas calendar on TV 2. Now she will inspire us to gather in the kitchen and prepare for Christmas together. Behind every hatch, Wenche shows us how to secure everything from the Christmas baking to the crispy slaw on the ribs. We get inspiring suggestions on how to make edible Christmas presents, and useful tricks to avoid the biggest blisters when we prepare our Christmas food.",
