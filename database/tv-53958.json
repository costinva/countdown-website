  "overview": "Two sisters, Adela and Andreea, who shared everything, find out that one of them is actually the daughter of a rich man and that her destiny is meant to be completely different. The mother of the two girls, a stingy and bad woman, but full of charm and humor, sends her real daughter, Andreea, to the world of the rich. Thus, Andreea assumes the identity of her sister, Adela, and moves from the slum to a luxurious villa in Snagov, owned by media mogul Paul Andronic. Andreea believes that her new family will give her everything she wanted in life and she is capable of anything to keep her new social position. Including lying to her \"sister\", Adela, who is actually the real heiress.",
