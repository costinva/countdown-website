  "overview": "Up until now, there has not been a club like this one. The Love Me Actually club is a unique gathering of five, charming, single men, still in their quest of finding that genuine love. The five men meet other single women that join the club voluntarily to escape their dull and jaded lives. The club takes them to different destinations all over the country and gives them a chance to get to know each other. And who knows, maybe exploring new places might unknowingly spark that love they all desire. The five eligible bachelors consist of the comic Heo Kyeong Hwan, the business savvy entrepreneur Park Sung Kwang, the rapper from INFINITE Dong Woo, the irresistible smiley Yang Se Chan, and the youngest of them all, the up-and-coming star actor Kim Min Gue. Join them and the hosts in this real romance variety show and experience the endless laughter, the awkwardness, and the affection each one of them has to offer. Maybe you should volunteer to join. Who will be the one to make your heart flutter?",
