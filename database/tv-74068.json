  "overview": "Plum follows Peter â€˜The Plum' Lum, a 49-year-old national football treasure who lives with his son Gavin and girlfriend Charmayne in Cronulla. It looks like Plum is living the dream until he discovers he has a brain disorder as a result of the hundreds of head knocks and concussions he suffered on the field. The new diagnosis doesn't receive its intended effect, as Plum would sooner hide, run and head to the pub for drinks with the boys and pretend everything is peaches. But hiding from the truth isn't easy when your ex-wife cares too much and your son comes to realise the father he worships is falling off his mantle and the game they love might be to blame.",
