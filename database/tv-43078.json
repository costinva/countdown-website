  "overview": "Boogie Beebies aims to get children off their seats and boogying along to pop songs especially created for them. In each programme, the viewer is introduced to a song created around a fun, child-friendly location. The song explores aspects of that location, using it as the basis for a series of moves that will make up a dance-routine.",
