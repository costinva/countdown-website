  "overview": "A four-part undercover investigation by Al Jazeera into Israel's covert influence campaign in the United States. To get unprecedented access to the Israel lobby's inner workings, undercover reporter \"Tony\" posed as a pro-Israel volunteer in Washington. The resulting film exposes the efforts of Israel and its lobbyists to spy on, smear and intimidate US citizens who support Palestinian human rights, especially BDS â€“ the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. It shows that Israel's semi-covert black-ops government agency, the Ministry of Strategic Affairs, is operating this effort in collusion with an extensive network of US-based organizations.",
