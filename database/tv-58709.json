  "overview": "The Reluctant Traveler With Eugene Levy will see Eugene Levy visit some of the world's most remarkable hotels, as well as explore the people, places and cultures that surround them. Self-confessedly not your average travel show host — he's not usually adventurous or well-versed in globe-trotting — he's agreed the time is right for him to broaden his horizons. Levy will be packing his suitcase with some trepidation but hoping his experiences might lead to a whole new chapter in his life — that's as long as he doesn't have to battle his motion sickness, and still gets dinner at 7.",
