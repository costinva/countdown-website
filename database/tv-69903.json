  "overview": "Paladino is a dentist who fights cavities during the day and crime at night. For that, he will have the support of the clumsy SÃ©rgio, who makes dental prostheses during the day, and of Sheila, his dubious secretary, owner of many facets, known in the square by her various names. The villain of the series is Detective Miller, who will do everything to discover the identity of the heroes. That's because the trio will end up committing crimes and breaking everything else that helps society. Because of this, the lawyer Vera will have to cut a corner to defend the anti-heroes. Also in the series is Eurico, a retired police officer and Paladino's sensationalist father. The hero had a tumultuous childhood relationship and tries to overcome his father, who worked as a police chief, in the fight against crime.",
