  "overview": "Amparo Seoane, the mayor of Cedeira and the most powerful woman in the area, is assassinated. Investigating the crime will become an obsession for Maite, a civil guard sergeant, and for Tomás, the only witness to the murder. For Maite, looking for the murderer is an obligation, it is her job. For Tomás, a professor of literature, it is the opportunity – possibly the last – to live a story like the ones he loves to read, and perhaps thus be able to tell it. Both will open an investigation that will affect the whole town. All of them, in one way or another, were related to Amparo. They all had something to gain or lose by her death.",
