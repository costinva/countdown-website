  "overview": "A few young people who love volleyball were rejected by the volleyball team because their height was not up to the standard. Later, they met Ka Yu, a former member of the Hong Kong women's volleyball team whose volleyball dream was broken, and they awakened Ka Yu's volleyball spirit with youth and passion. She became the first female coach in the history of men's volleyball in Hong Kong. They used actions to tell everyone \"We are the Littles\", but don't underestimate us!",
