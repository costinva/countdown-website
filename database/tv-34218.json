  "overview": "Sinister thoughts, deepening resentment and manipulative mind games are temporary - but Murder is Forever, an all-new dramatic series created in partnership with bestselling author James Patterson and the Emmy-winning producers at Stephen David Entertainment. Murder is Forever - Patterson's first foray into true-crime television, based upon the authentic stories featured in his upcoming paperback books. Each hour-long episode of Murder is Forever presents a unique murder mystery that keeps viewers guessing until the very end - but perhaps the most shocking thing of all, is that these stunning crimes are 100% real. Each self-contained story will live both on-screen and within the pages of Patterson's true crime paperback titles, which correspond to each episode, will be published beginning January 2, 2018 and available everywhere books are sold.",
