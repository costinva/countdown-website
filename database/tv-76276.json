  "overview": "One mistake of youth - and years of attempts to correct it. Since childhood, Vlada has been inconvenient for those around her: difficult, distrustful, aggressive. Having stumbled once, the girl has served her sentence and wants to start a new life. Max helps her in this, having already gone through hell in New Girl. But the past again pulls Vlada to the bottom. And this time, on the path to freedom, you need to overcome not only yourself.",
