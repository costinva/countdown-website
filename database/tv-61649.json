  "overview": "The team around forensic pathologist Dr. Katrin Stoll (Valerie Niehaus) and Chief Inspector Mirko Kiefer (David Rott) rolls up unsolved criminal cases due to new evidence. They not only want to identify the perpetrator, but also help the bereaved according to the motto \"You have a right to the truth!\". Because only when the perpetrator has been found and the motive has been clarified will the victim's relatives be relieved of their tormenting uncertainty - such as parents who only find out afterwards that their son had not broken off contact with the family, but was killed and buried, or Detainees who have always protested their innocence in a murder and are only now being rehabilitated.",
