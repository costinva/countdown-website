  "overview": "The Maritime Special Operation Forces (MARSOF) operate worldwide under the most extreme conditions to keep The Netherlands safe. These marines are very strong and after a very tough selection are trained for anti-terrorism and special operations. When all other options have failed, these men are the last resort. We tell the story of this special unit on the basis of never-before-seen visual material and very personal interviews.",
