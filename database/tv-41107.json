  "overview": "The People's News is a series covering news, events and gossip - not through the official bulletins and newsreels; but through the views and reactions of Scottish people who take to their cameras to discuss this week's burning issues. Over half an hour, this fast-moving, modern and funny opinion show allows ordinary Scots from every demographic and corner of the country to set the agenda and speak their minds - putting the nation and the wider world to rights direct from their kitchen, gym or farm.",
