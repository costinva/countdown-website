All he had left was a series of frosty videos he had shot shortly before his death. The grieving father puts together fragments of Marty's online life to reveal the circumstances of his tragic end. Inspired by real cyberbullying cases, the eight-part thriller #martyisdead won the main prize at the Serial Killer international festival.",
