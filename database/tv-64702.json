  "overview": "The series follows \"Southern Charm\" resident boss-lady Leva Bonaparte as she manages Charleston's very own \"it\" crowd, otherwise known as her larger-than-life staff at Republic Garden &amp; Lounge. Leva and husband Lamar own four restaurants along the city's famous King Street, but Republic is the crown jewel of their kingdom. The hottest nightclub and backdrop for Charleston's lively party scene, Republic is the place to go for pleasure, business or both.",
