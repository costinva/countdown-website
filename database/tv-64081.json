  "overview": "Mamoru Nekoyashiki is a reclusive artist who makes doujinshi works: fan-created or self-published works. He has created a BL-themed manga series that he dreams of being able to sell in a special section for popular doujinshi titles in bookstores. Only a select few doujinshi artists are ever granted this rare honor – and being selected to sell his works in this manner would be a major source of recognition for his art.But his life turns upside down when he is suddenly reunited with Kazama Issei, a childhood friend that he used to have a crush on. The two parted in somewhat ambiguous circumstances when they had an exchange at their high school graduation ceremony. Since leaving school, Kazama Issei has become a pop star. He has now joined an all-male pop group named Shiny Smile, which is on the road to chart success. Will reuniting with Kazama Issei help Mamoru Nekoyashiki attain his dream – or could it lead the duo down an unexpected path to romance?",
