  "overview": "A cunning realtor swindled several families and sold them one house. Now they will live under the same roof: the family of an ex-military who is used to setting his own rules in any circumstances, a family of hipsters whose marriage is crumbling before our eyes, an aging actress with a young lover, a kept woman who was abandoned by her \"daddy\" and a crazy grandfather who lives in the attic . They have to accept the shortcomings and lifestyle of each other, because they have no other living space.",
