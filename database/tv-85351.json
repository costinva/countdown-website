  "overview": "One Night in Idaho: The College Murders centers on the families and friends of the victims, featuring exclusive interviews with Stacey and Jim Chapin (parents of Ethan Chapin), and Karen and Scott Laramie (parents of Madison Mogan). On November 13th, 2022 – in the still of the night – four University of Idaho students are brutally stabbed to death in an off-campus house in the quiet college town of Moscow, Idaho. Within the devastated families and the community at large, questions and fear abound. What happened? Who did this, and could the killer be among us? And why these four young adults? The twists and turns of what happens next – an explosion of social media sleuthing, a cross-country manhunt, a dramatic arrest, and a looming trial – have made this crime one of the most high-profile stories of the last decade, capturing the country's attention, imagination, and paranoia like almost no other case before it.",
