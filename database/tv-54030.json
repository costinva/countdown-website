  "overview": "Many years ago, the half demon Si Teng was hunted down by a devout Taoist monk. Chased across Shanghai, Si Teng fled for her life but escaping the relentless monk proved impossible. In an act of cruel piety, the monk killed Si Teng and buried her remains at the base of a great cliff. There she would have remained for all eternity, had fate not chosen to intervene. Resurrected by the unwitting actions of a young designer by the name of Qin Fang, Si Teng finds herself in a strange new world. Determined to understand the mysteries of her past, Si Teng and Qin Fang continue to search for answers, their quest drawing them ever closer. But how long will their happiness last when the demon of the past refuses to die?",
