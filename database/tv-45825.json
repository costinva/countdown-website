  "overview": "Chivalry skewers and satirises the complex state of contemporary sexual politics, while asking if romance can survive in the post #MeToo era.An unlikely couple are put together by a cynical studio exec to salvage a failing movie. Bobby, is a woke writer/director and mother of one, with a precarious relationship and a dodgy visa. She has industry heat after her successful, low-budget indie debut and is promised studio funding for her feminist Biblical biopic if she can rescue this sexually controversial thriller first.  Cameron, is a successful film producer and ‘ladies man', who has just been dumped by yet another twenty-something girlfriend (via WhatsApp).  He knows he must detoxify his sexist movie or face ruin, and thus, an unlikely partnership is forged. As Bobby and Cameron work through their gender tensions, a creeping attraction and the nagging feeling that they are just pawns in the studio's agenda for a Saudi buyout, reshooting a toxic sex scene becomes the tip of the iceberg.How fluid are our politics and how political are our fluids? And can romance blossom - not in spite of #MeToo, but because of it? ",
