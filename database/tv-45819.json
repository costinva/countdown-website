  "overview": "The Witnesses follows the stories of four former Jehovah's Witnesses, as they recount details of the sexual abuse they endured during their time within the organization. The Jehovah's Witnesses religion has long relied on its own governing body to set the course by which its followers live their lives. By examining the organization's policies and practices, the special explores whether those procedures operate to conceal the identities of potential child predators. For half a decade, investigative journalist from The Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), Trey Bundy, has been working to empower the public to protect children within the insular institution, reporting the stories of survivors of sexual abuse.",
