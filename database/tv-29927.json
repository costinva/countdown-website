  "overview": "Janey and Grandma escape their frigid Michigan hometown for the palm tree lined streets of sunny Los Angeles. Bright-eyed early-twenty-something Janey has always dreamed of becoming an actress so she and her Grandma, a quirky sixty-something with a young heart, pack up and head west where Grandma realizes she too aspires to be famous. Me and My Grandma follows the misadventures of the two best friends as they take on career, hookups, and life in Hollywood - all while saving up for a second air mattress.",
