  "overview": "Industry follows a group of young graduates competing for a limited set of permanent positions at a top investment bank in Londonâ€”but the boundaries between colleague, friend, lover, and enemy soon blur as they immerse themselves in a company culture defined as much by sex, drugs, and ego as it is by deals and dividends. As members of the group rise and fall, they must decide whether life is about more than the bottom line.",
