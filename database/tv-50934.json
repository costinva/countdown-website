  "overview": "Archeologists are astonished about a breaking discovery in Egypt generating unprecedented headlines around the world. In Saqqara, just outside of Cairo, buried 36 feet deep, an incredible 27+ sarcophagi were recently found. Untouched and unopened for over 2,500 years, they retained their original color. Deemed as one of the most remarkable sites found in recent history, Smithsonian Channel has cameras on the ground with exclusive access to document this historical revelation for Tomb Hunters (w/t).",
