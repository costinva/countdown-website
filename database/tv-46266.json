  "overview": "He creeps up when you least expect it, offering a lift when you're stranded, showing up unannounced at your house, intercepting you on the road, lurking at the curb, watching and waiting to make his move. Can you trust this stranger? Is he a Good Samaritan or the stuff of nightmares? Should you jump inside? Should you take the chance? If you won't go willingly, he'll make the ride mandatory, and take you on one final, terror-filled trip. Once you're in his prison on wheels, there's no escape from the man with a van.Â ",
