  "overview": "Based in Bundaberg Queensland Australia,  the team at Exploring Off the Grid love nothing more than hitting the road, tracks and water in search of Australia's idyllic places, we will travel far and wide to find old relics, wartime plane crashes, old huts and machinery. In doing so we get to see some amazing places, meet some awesome people and experience some true Australian characters. Whether it be Cape York, Tasmania, the Kimberley or anywhere in between join us on the adventure! ",
