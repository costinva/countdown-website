  "overview": "The up-and-coming politician Eva Blumenthal is mercilessly confronted with the political business. An intrigue forces Eva, a member of the Bundestag, to resign her mandate. She then changes sides and is recruited by a lobbying agency. As an employee, she quickly learns how politics really works. And not only that: Her new employer Wolfgang Zielert is behind the intrigue that has destroyed her political career. But why was she brought to the other side? Is she just a small piece of the puzzle in a big conspiracy to prevent the German energy turnaround? Spontaneous, quick-witted and willing to cross borders, the young woman has made it her goal to track down more of the people behind the conspiracy. In her efforts to prove her innocence, however, Eva Blumenthal herself runs the risk of losing her moral compass.",
