  "overview": "The French village of Clochemerle is a happy place that has avoided all hints of modernity and culture... until now. The mayor wants to build a new public edifice, something that will draw a crowd, but none of it will happen in the way that he planned. A small village with a powerful church, a republican government, several beautiful wives, one handsome lover, a staunch catholic spinster and many more headstrong personalities are about to clash in a way that will bring pain to some, mirth to others and even the army to fail to keep the peace in a small French village called Clochemerle.",
