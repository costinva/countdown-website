  "overview": "The Way We Were is a timely assessment of the Irish National Identity as seen through the everyday lives of ordinary people since the official formation of The State in 1937. Full of surprising revelations about our recent past – as viewed through the recollections &amp; observations of well-known Irish personalities, pundits &amp; experts – The Way We Were builds into a richly compelling &amp; hugely entertaining revaluation of how we've lived our lives over the past 80 years.",
