  "overview": "À coeur battant takes us into individual stories, but at the same time, they concern the whole family and society. These stories will allow us to better understand the dynamics of violence, to also measure the extent to which we live in a culture of violence where everyone in our families does not take enough measure of it. Are we too tolerant of violent words, looks, attitudes, gestures and controlling habits?",
