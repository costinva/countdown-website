  "overview": "Five public figures are challenged by \"Taskmaster\" Vasco Palmeirim and his assistant Nuno Markl to overcome a series of fun tests with a small dose of madness. Over the course of 8 programs, guests put personal assets at stake and face challenges that put their physical dexterity, creativity and especially their dignity in check. In each program, there is only one objective: to achieve the best performance in the tasks to accumulate the maximum points, which will allow each guest to recover their precious asset, in case they are considered the winner, after the scrutiny of Taskmaster Vasco Palmeirim and the precious help from his assistant, Nuno Markl.",
