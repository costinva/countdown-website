  "overview": "Su Qiang Wei was originally a well-known obstetrician and gynecologist, but she was fired by the hospital because of her ex-husband's lover. Her hand was injured, and she could no longer perform surgery. She heard that the well-known overbearing boss's family was recruiting a physical therapist for his grandmother, and went to apply for the high salary. But she didn't realise that Huo Si Ting was looking for a wife, and she had always thought she was just applying to be the family doctor.",
