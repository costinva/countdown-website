  "overview": "Innokenty Melnikov, a charismatic and successful architect, who has three marriages behind him, remains, despite divorces, the main person in the life of his women - Lena, Yulia and Vari. Kesha not only continues to actively support them and communicate closely with them, but also secretly maintains a sexual relationship. However, the symbiosis convenient for everyone begins to collapse after the man becomes interested in Alla, a girl from a completely different \"circle\". Now the offended ladies jokingly offer to get rid of him.",
