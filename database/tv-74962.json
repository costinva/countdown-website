  "overview": "In Hong Kong, family members of a missing person may apply for the person concerned to be declared legally dead after seven years. While production house boss Yeung Man-sum decides to forget his wife Koo Ching-tin, who has been missing for seven years, and marry his lovely and supportive girlfriend Chu Sin-mei, his son Chi-hin's birth mother Ching-tin astonishingly turns up! Due to some falling off a cliff accident, Ching-tin became forgetful and ended up homeless somewhere overseas. With lawyer Kam Cheung-sing's help, Ching-tin returns to Hong Kong after seven years. She wants to retrieve her old memories. Ching-tin again works as a journalist. She curiously finds out someone seemed to have harmed her when she went missing. Meanwhile, Man-sum is torn between his new love and wedded wife. And he is worried about Ching-tin recovering from amnesia as the situation could get out of hand.",
