  "overview": "In 1998, Elif Çınar, the wife of Rauf Çınar, one of the country's leading economics professors, is stabbed by a burglar named Necip Talan. The lives of these two families from completely different worlds change after that night. Rauf Çınar's daughter Zeynep Çınar loses her only mother that night; Akay Talan loses his father, his only hero. Akay Talan, who became anonymous, nameless, and homeless in one night, today, under the name Kara, has sworn to steal from those who steal from us so that no child will suffer the same fate as him. Zeynep Çınar returns to Istanbul after studying abroad. She continues her love of plants inherited from her mother through the documentaries she makes. The only thing these two people of two different worlds have in common is that night. Whether they like it or not, life will bring them face to face once again, and even the obstacles in front of them will not prevent them from falling in love. But what happens when the truth comes out?",
