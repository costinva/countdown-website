  "overview": "Jian Xiangxiang, a traditional incense maker, is devastated by a double betrayal—her boyfriend, Gu Jiacheng, betrays her in both love and career. Just when she's at her lowest, a barrage of mysterious on-screen comments (danmu) suddenly appears out of thin air, mocking her relentlessly. At first, Jian thinks she's hallucinating. But after several events unfold exactly as predicted, she realizes the comments have the power to foretell the future. They clearly warn her: in three months, Gu Jiacheng will have her committed to a psychiatric hospital. Determined to defy fate and take revenge, Jian sets her sights on Gu Jiacheng's third uncle—Gu Jingshi. Though Gu Jingshi is in a wheelchair, he exudes the cold, commanding aura of a true power player and is, in fact, the real head of the Gu family. Jian knows that tears and tantrums are for losers. If she wants Gu Jiacheng to fall to his knees and beg for forgiveness, she must become his aunt—Gu Jingshi's woman. Thus begins a calculated game of seduction that starts with strategy… and ends in irresistible obsession.",
