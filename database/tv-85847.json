  "overview": "Eight double murders. Seventeen years of terror. Always the same weapon. A .22 caliber Beretta. One of the longest and most complex Italian investigations into the first and most brutal serial killer in the country's history: Il Mostro di Firenze. A series based on true events, direct testimonies, procedural documents and journalistic investigations. All terribly true. Because we believe that telling the truth, and only that, is the only way to bring justice to the victims. In a story where there have been many possible monsters, over time and investigations, our story focuses on them, the possible monsters, from their point of view. Because the monster, in the end, could be anyone.",
