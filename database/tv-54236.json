  "overview": "High time to break new ground! With traditional methods of fighting crime, the police in Berlin don't stand a chance against highly equipped gangsters. At the center of the powerful special unit of the HeliCops team is the prototype of a high-tech helicopter: bulletproof and equipped with infrared sensors, super directional microphones and a pulse cannon. Karl \"Charly\" von Schumann (Christoph M. Ohrt) is the only one who can tame the ultra-modern flying machine. At his side - \"armed\" with a Harley and razor-sharp wits - fights the attractive criminalist Jenny Harland (Doreen Jacobi). ",
