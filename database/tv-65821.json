  "overview": "One family has been fighting for over 70 years to recover what they say is rightfully theirs - a $28 billion treasure buried deep inside a mountain in the New Mexico desert. Some believe the U.S. Government stole the 16,000 gold bars and priceless artifacts, while skeptics claim it never existed. Now, for the first time ever, the family and its supporters reveal exclusive evidence to prove their case and crack open the mystery of America's greatest treasure story. The truth of Victorio Peak has never been told... until now.",
