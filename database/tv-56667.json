  "overview": "Madame's Place is an American sitcom that featured the misadventures of Madame, a puppet in the form of a bawdy old movie star with a naughty sense of humor. Madame's Place aired for one first-run season from September 20, 1982 until February 25, 1983, although the actual number of episodes produced is disputed (some references say 75, some say 150). The show was unusual for a sitcom in that it was produced for first-run syndication to air five days a week.",
