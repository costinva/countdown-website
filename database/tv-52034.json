  "overview": "The Nasty Boys are a special unit of the North Las Vegas Police Department. The unit consists of undercover cops and their identities are withheld, even from the department. They only answer to their boss, Lieutenant Krieger, who in turn only answers to the Chief, and if there is ever an instance that they have to bust the people they are working on, they wear ninja-type outfits to conceal their identities.",
