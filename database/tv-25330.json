  "overview": "Kasumi Takeshi has just retired and is quietly getting into his second life. He never had the luxury of a beer during the day on a weekday during his 35 years as a salaryman. But in that instant Kasumi gets acquainted with the taste of that one glass and eating alone. This is the start of his battle with eating by himself. It is an unexpectedly high hurdle for Kasumi to cross and one that he keeps fretting over.",
