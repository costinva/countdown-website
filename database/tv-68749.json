  "overview": "A spin-off for Juliana and Valentina from the Spanish soap opera, Amar a Muerte. Story of two girls with many differences such as social status and education, but that didn't stop them from being very good friends who ended up falling in love. With a surprising and nothing morbid interpretation the actresses gave voice and courage to many to express their feelings without fear. A love story that shows us that Love is Love.",
