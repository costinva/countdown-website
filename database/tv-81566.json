  "overview": "Nadya has been married to Igor for ten years. He has created a successful construction business, and she helps him as a lawyer. A major deal in Nadya's hometown is suspended because one person does not want to sell his land. And so she goes to Rybinsk to solve the problem. Nadya collects information about the stubborn landowner. It turns out that Andrey only owns half of the house, and the other half belongs to his ex-wife. The woman is ready to sell, but Andrey is not. All attempts by the capital's lawyer to persuade Andrey are unsuccessful, so Nadya takes a desperate step: she buys half of his house and begins to poison his life, forcing him to sell. Competing in creating unbearable living conditions for each other, they themselves do not notice how they begin to get closer.",
