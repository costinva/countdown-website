  "overview": "At the time of the construction of the Egyptian pyramids, the Okunev archaeological culture was already flourishing on the territory of the Republic of Khakassia. Its representatives left behind unique monuments of ancient art dating back 3-2 thousand years BC.These are huge stone steles illustrating the structure of the Universe, rock paintings of animals, people and mysterious signs, as well as miniature bone crafts that accompanied ancient people during life and after death. Researchers, artists, and representatives of indigenous peoples discuss the meaning and significance of Okunev art, as well as its connection with the modern culture of Khakassia and Russia.",
