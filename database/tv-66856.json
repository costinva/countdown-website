  "overview": "Most people think they know everything about cows. They stand around in fields, eat grass, moo, and of course, provide milk. They are archetypal symbols of a rural scene of everlasting tranquility. But cows are much more than that. Cows have personalities; they are sensitive, able to learn, socially oriented, and able to defend themselves. This series tells the surprising story of a cow's life.",
