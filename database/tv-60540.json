  "overview": "Each year in Quebec, 450 bailiffs serve several deeds and collect thousands of dollars in debts. Behind every door is a human being and the bailiffs will have to listen, show empathy and thus find a way to resolve each situation. Huissiers plunges us into the world of these unloved and misunderstood legal professionals who find themselves first in front of offenders.",
