  "overview": "In Britain today many working class white men feel demonised, forgotten and angry. Professor Green explores what life is really like for these men, why many of them feel abandoned, and what the consequences are for Britain if we continue to look away. Raised by his nan on a council estate in Hackney, Professor Green is himself from a working class, low-income background. Over a period of six months he follows six working class white men in different parts of the country to understand what life in modern Britain is like for them. He examines the challenges and barriers they face in education, work, family life and in the way the rest of society regards them.",
