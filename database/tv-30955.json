  "overview": "Clearly a riff on the streaming giant's acclaimed true crime series Making a Murderer and The Keepers, American Vandal is a true crime satire that explores the aftermath of a costly high school prank that left twenty-seven faculty cars vandalized with phallic images. Over the course of the eight-episode season, an aspiring sophomore documentarian Peter Maldonado investigates the controversial and potentially unjust expulsion of Dylan Maxwell, the troubled senior accused of the phallic vandalization.",
