  "overview": "A comedy show following the life of 11-year-old Oliver Beene. It's 1962 and Oliver's world is chaotic. His dentist father, Jerry likes to spend Sundays drilling his kids' teeth; his mom, Charlotte does her best to be the happy homemaker; and his brother Ted has a transistor radio practically glued to his head listening to sports. Oliver's life is tolerable thanks to his friends heavyweight Neal and lightweight Michael, who is obviously gay in a time when that still means happy. The show is narrated by the adult Oliver who depicts the trials of growing up during the Cold War with a wickedly wry humor.",
