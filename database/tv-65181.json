  "overview": "In The Spencer Sisters, after a string of bad luck, Toronto police officer Darby Spencer quits her job and is forced to return home to her estranged mother, internationally renowned mystery novelist Victoria Spencer. After the duo are thrust into solving a crime together, Darby discovers a side to Victoria she never knew, and ultimately takes the plunge into the unlikeliest of ventures: becoming her partner in a private detective agency. Despite their opposing personalities, generational differences and complicated history, they discover they may have more in common than they thought. Each episode brings a new case to solve, and while the tightly-wound Darby and the carefree Victoria may never quite see eye to eye, they discover that maybe – just maybe – they need each other more than they realize.",
