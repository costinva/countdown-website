  "overview": "Soap Talk is a television talk show on SOAPnet hosted by Lisa Rinna and Ty Treadway. It debuted in 2002 and ended in 2006. The reason for the show's cancellation was due to SOAPnet expanding their programming away from a soap opera-related focus. Lisa Rinna was chosen to host the show after executives at ABC (who owned SOAPnet) were impressed by her on-screen auditions to take over the spot left open by Kathie Lee Gifford on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. She was actually Regis Philbin's first choice, but the network went with then ABC Daytime soap star Kelly Ripa. Lisa also had a background in soaps. She was Billie Reed on NBC Daytime's Days of Our Lives in the 1990s, as well as a stint on Melrose Place. Ty Treadway was starring on One Life to Live at the time. The show taped at ABC Prospect Studios in Hollywood, California. Ty lived on the East Coast and had to fly in every weekend",
