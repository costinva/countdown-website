  "overview": "No Internet. No phone. Not even daily mail service. Follow four families as they turn their backs on civilization to live out their dreams as modern day pioneers in the harsh Alaskan wilderness. Join them as they face the daily challenges of basic survival food, warmth and fending off grizzlies in Braving Alaska. Then, travel deep below the frozen tundra, see places rarely touched by humans and get dangerously close to the largest carnivore on Earth in three other amazing films: Alaska s Last Oil, Bear Island and Giant Bears of Kodiak Island.",
