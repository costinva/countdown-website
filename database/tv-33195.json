  "overview": "In Walk of Shame Shuttle, some of the UK's biggest party animals in need of a lift are offered a taxi ride and in the true confessional style of all good cab rides the passengers share details of their wildest night out. From Tinder dates gone wrong and dance floor shame, to awkward sexual encounters, bringing home unwanted furry friends and waking up with your one night stand's mum, this rigged cab will capture it all. The cast of streetwise shuttle drivers, Jay, Max and AJ are there to act as both personalised chauffeur and agony aunt, listening without judgment to the exploits and hilarious confessions of their wild customers. Once the passenger has been safely dropped off, it's back to the cab office to share the latest tales with the controller and other drivers.",
