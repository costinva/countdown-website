  "overview": "Hosted by comedian David Alan Grier, Snap Decision asks the question: \"What can you tell about a person just by looking at them?\" Studio contestants are asked to make snap judgments about three strangers, recently interviewed on the street. Looks can be deceiving, as people are often not who they may seem. The winner receives a $10,000 grand prize.",
