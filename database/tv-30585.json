  "overview": "The Rich and The Ruthless is the only black owned daytime drama in the industry, also known as \"the stories\", is operated by tight fisted, debonair, self-made, Augustus Barringer. When greedy studio executives inform that The Rich and the Ruthless is getting booted off the sound stages for another talk show after twenty years, Augustus Barringer is ready to fight back on another level to stay on the air, even if it means filming his quirky soap opera out of his sleek Hollywood mansion...temporarily. And before moving the company to Jamaica! The Rich and the Ruthless isn't just a soap-within-a-soap it's a sudser with soul and a family drama!",
