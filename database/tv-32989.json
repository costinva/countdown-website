  "overview": "At one time the most wanted man on the planet, Pablo Escobar, buried masses of his estimated $50 billion fortune all over Colombia - the vast majority of which has never been recovered. Now, two former CIA case officers - armed with the skills and training that stem from 10 years of work overseas - are partnering together with the original DEA agents made famous in Narcos to hunt for the cash. Once located, this elite team will return the money to the Colombia people and government, finally closing the book on Pablo Escobar's reign.",
