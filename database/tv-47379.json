  "overview": "The 35-year-old Charlotte wanted to change her life, and really. She has been struggling with her job in the advertising agency for a long time and it is not going well with her family. Only her best friend knows how much it simmers inside of her. And maybe that's a good thing, because suddenly the pandemic comes and everything changes. Actually, Charlotte just wanted to get out. Out of the job, out of the marriage, but now she has to stop and stay inside (Drinnen).",
