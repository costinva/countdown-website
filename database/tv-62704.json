  "overview": "The Pyrenees with Michael Portillo sees Michael embark on an extraordinary voyage of self-discovery, exploring the dramatic mountain range that straddles the border between France and Spain, the Pyrenees. The four-part series is a real adventure for Michael as he walks a stretch of the 270 mile trail through the Pyrenees, from the Bay of Biscay on the Atlantic coast in the West to the shores of the Mediterranean in the East. In each episode, he'll be meeting up with locals who will share their knowledge and introduce Michael to all kinds of new experiences, from stargazing at night from a mountain peak, enjoying a delicious Cassoulet, soaking in a hot spring or attempting to spot a lynx.Â ",
