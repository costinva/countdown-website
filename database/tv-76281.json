  "overview": "Touka Mimori and his classmates are abruptly catapulted into a fantasy world, summoned by the resident goddess to serve as heroes. The good news? Most of the students display amazing skills upon arrival! The bad? Mimori is the worst of the lot, bottoming out at a measly E-rank. Incensed, the goddess tosses him into a dungeon to dieâ€“but it turns out that Mimori's skills aren't so much worthless as they are abnormal. Abnormally powerful, perhaps!",
