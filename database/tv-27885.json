  "overview": "Nissene på låven was a Norwegian TV series created by the Norwegian actors / comics Espen Eckbo and Kristian Ødegård. The series was broadcast as a kind of Christmas calendar, with a fifteen minutes long episode each day in December, and was a parody of the many doctrines that appeared in the early 2000s.The series was recorded on a hayloft at Fråstad farm, Fetsund, Norway, and went like Expedition Robinson and many similar series on trying to stay for as long as possible. From the beginning, that is, December 1, there were 24 participants, but for each day that passed a person was voted out.The series is characterized by a clear Christmas theme, because among the distinguishing rules it was included that all participants throughout the series would wear a blanket, blanket, and not eat anything other than Christmas gravy and candy. Like the Expedition Robinson, the \"Tomtar\" were initially divided into two teams that competed against each other in a variety of branches (such as Christmas bunny, Christmas ornament and Christmas gift) before becoming a \"merging\" when the series began to come to an end. The initial division of the team consisted of the \"gray beard\" and \"white beard\". In this case, one could clearly distinguish between the two teams using the color of the participants' blankets.",
