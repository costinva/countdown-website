  "overview": "All families have secrets, but not like this. Behind the closed curtains of suburbia, not all is as it seems. Someone has a secret and they are prepared to do whatever it takes -- including murder -- to ensure it remains hidden forever. Detectives meet a wall of lies where nothing is what it seems as they try to pick their way through the clues. Feuding families, illicit relationships, and deadly secrets are hidden from investigators. If they want to solve the murder, detectives must delve deeper and expose a secret someone is prepared to kill for.",
