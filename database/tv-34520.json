  "overview": "The series captures a yearlong look at one of Chicago's most progressive and diverse public schools, located in suburban Oak Park. That premise â€” an intimate look at the students, teachers and administrators and the challenges facing them in Oak Park and River Forest High School, allows a prism for a larger look at America's charged state of race, culture and education.",
