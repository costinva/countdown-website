  "overview": "Picking up where the enchanting adventure of Mickey Saves Christmas left off, Mickey's Christmas Tales lets us jump back in with Mickey, Minnie and the gang along with Santa, Mrs. Claus and everyone's favorite baby reindeer, Jingle and Jolly, for even more stop-motion excitement. The shorts follow Mickey and Friends in classic holiday misadventures such as Goofy teaching how to build a snowman, the gang trying to grant a Christmas wish by placing a star atop the Town Square Christmas tree, surprising Santa and so much more.",
