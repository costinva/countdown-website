  "overview": "My Little Pony: Pony Life looks at the funny side of friendship. The new center of the world is Sugarcube Corner–-just like going to a friend's house after school, this is our ponies' home away from home. Here, Pinkie Pie serves up frosted cupcakes to the best customers in the world—her friends! Pony Life episodes feature hilarious, \"Slice of Life\" stories that modern kids can relate to. The series is loaded with magic, including a mysterious source of potions that Pinkie keeps hidden behind the bakery counter and breaks out when the need arises.",
