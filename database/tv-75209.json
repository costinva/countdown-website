  "overview": "The Romanian series Let me, I like it! Room 609, an adaptation of the Turkish production Room 309, has in the foreground a love story that does not fit into clichés. The protagonists do not fall in love at first sight, but meet by mistake, and from that moment a domino-type situation begins, in which awkwardness, come-and-go, comic situations, but also romantic and emotional ones continue without stopping. Also in the foreground is a very large inheritance, which is not acquired through succession, but through a special condition imposed by will. Of course, the inheritance is highly desired by some and highly desired by others, which sparks a tragico-comic competition among the contenders.",
