  "overview": "A love story that exists despite everything. The story of betrayal and forgiveness. The three fates entwined in the fatal triangle before the Second World War, which trampled and destroyed all their plans and hopes. Feelings survived the terrible war and separation and became only stronger. So many times over and over again: in the next generation, and even in the prosperous era of the 80's, when it's not children anymore, but grandchildren are forced to experience love and hatred for half a century to understand what it's like",
