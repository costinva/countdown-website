  "overview": "A comedy show with a genuinely original twist - we've covertly filmed members of the public having conversations, then recorded our own dialogue to replace theirs. The result is a unique hybrid of a hidden camera format and a sketch show, as seemingly mundane situations are given a surreal slant, and regular people are re-imagined as bizarre characters. Presented as a stream of snippets of ordinary city life, this show packs all the strangest things you've ever overheard whilst wandering around into four five minute episodes.",
