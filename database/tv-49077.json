  "overview": "In the secret and magic silence of libraries, hidden behind sober, beautiful bookbindings lies an infinity of treasures: the most alluring and heady one is entrusted to us by the authors themselves. Apart from their publicly recognized works, many famous authors, either signing with their own name or concealing their talent under a pseudonym, had fun imagining stories in which the mischievous games of love and beauty were exalted. This series has discovered those small jewels, those exquisite fantasies, to present them to you, learned and sensitive public. So let us slowly leaf through these furtive, secret pages whose perfume has not evaporated over time. Softly from Paris come these tales.",
