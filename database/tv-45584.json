  "overview": "The farmers Kurt Brakelmann and Arthur Adsche Tönnsen are the two stars of this series from Germany's far north, which combines the idyll of the Plateland with the natural humor of its residents. Kurt and Adsche have known each other for ages and are already trying to outdo each other again and again. But when storm clouds rise over the home of Büttenwarder and problems arise, the two stick together like bad luck and sulfur and mostly every situation with wit and peasant cunning. And at sunset Kurt and Adsche sit with stable boy Kuno and Mayor Schönbiehl in Wirt Shorty's village mug and start the day's events with the local house drink \"Lütt un Lütt\".",
