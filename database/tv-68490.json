  "overview": "From CCN Original Series and Emmy® Award-winning executive producers Tom Hanks, Gary Goetzman, and Mark Herzog comes a new installment of the iconic Decades series. The 2010s looks at the years that gave us Instagram, President Barack Obama, marriage equality, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and Trumpism, culminating in the single most dramatic year of the 21st century: 2020. It also looks at the decade that became known as the second golden age of television. The seven-part series features rich archival footage and interviews with the likes of Dr. Anthony Fauci, Benny Blanco, Bill Kristol, David Remnick, Este Haim, FINNEAS, Fiona Hill, Jemele Hill, Lena Waithe, Maggie Haberman, Rami Malek, Reince Priebus, Ted Sarandos, Tom Hanks, and Vince Gilligan; as well as CNN anchors and correspondents Chris Wallace, Dana Bash, Fareed Zakaria, Manu Raju, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Sara Sidner, Van Jones, and many more. The documentary series examines a turbulent era marked by political and social upheaval. It was a decade in which social media transformed society and streaming upended entertainment, resulting in genre-defying music and ushering in the era of \"peak TV.\"",
