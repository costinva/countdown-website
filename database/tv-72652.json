  "overview": "Jane is a cocky Korean-Australian adoptee with a love of hairy white guys â€“ the hairier and whiter the better. When her friends call her out for having a white man fetish she sets out to try and reprogram her libido, reignites a connection with childhood friend, Yu Chang and stumbles into the process of finding out who she really is. From hens' nights to country weddings, moon crystals, \"gotcha\" days and adoptee dinners, it's a K-Pop-infused, action-packed, wild ride filled with revelations, surprises and a large helping of Asian pop culture.",
