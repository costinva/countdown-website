  "overview": "Some of them have a lot of dance experience behind them, some do not speak the language of dance at all. Every concert they have to prove that they deserve to go further, so as not to be at risk after the vote. During the project, couples will compete for the status of the best mentor in the team. Those whose dancing skills are far from ideal risk leaving the project. The couples' dances will be evaluated by the guests of the release – famous artists, as well as the best choreographers. Together with the mentors, they will give points for each dance. At the end of the program, the couple who scored the least points leaves the show. Also, each mentor will have immunity, which she will be able to use only once for the entire season and save her mate from leaving.",
