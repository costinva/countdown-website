  "overview": "Manshow is a Norwegian studio-based comedy show with HÃ¥vard Lilleheie. Morten Ramm was the program leader's \"sidekick\". The program was aimed at men and was disputed because of its creepy style. It contained quite a lot of gross sexualized humor, which was perceived as female-discriminatory. Much of the content was in the studio with a youthful audience present, but each broadcast also featured more pre-recorded mood clips with Lilleheie and Ramm in the main roles. Several well-known Norwegians were guests in the program. The concept was based on an American program entitled The Man Show.",
