Detective Savard, a friend, asks for his expertise to decode religious symbols left on the bodies of victims of sordid murders. Thomas's intuitive intelligence, as well as his great knowledge, makes it possible to establish a link between crimes and a mysterious group of devotees with a troubled past.",
