  "overview": "This drama tells the story of Qing Cai (played by Darren Chen), the son of the late king, who lives anonymously in a small town to stay away from political disputes in the court. When his adoptive father Han Zhong is in danger, he has to disguise himself as a woman to sneak into Mingyi Villa, which only recruits female disciples. He meets the Mo Sect orphan Gan Po (played by Zheng Hehuizi) who came to seek revenge, as well as Wang Yishao (played by Zhu Zanjin), Han Aizhen (played by Wang Zijia), Gao Yin (played by Moe Jiang), Hu Jiao (played by Yin Qixi), and others with various identities and motives. As Qing Cai lands himself in ridiculously comical situations as he tries to hide his identity, he also develops feelings for Gan Pu. The two bickering friends Qing Cai and Gan Pu gradually fall in love with each other, but in the face of their true identities, they drift apart. When Gan Pu finally works out her conflicted feelings, she joins hands with Qing Cai to fight against the enemy.",
