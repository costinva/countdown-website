  "overview": "In Dumbarton, Scotland, a journalist uncovers a sixty-year history of \ndogs jumping to their death from a fifteen meter bridge. Could something\n be luring the dogs to the other side? In Kerala, India, villagers hear a\n loud sonic boom one morning and wake to see blood red rain falling from\n the sky. Is it just desert dust or could it be evidence of \nextra-terrestrial life? Lions living in the Serengeti National Park in \nTanzania are exhibiting disturbing behavior: violent seizures and \nbattles to the death with other lions. As the death toll climbs, will \ninvestigators identify the cause before the great beasts are pushed to \nthe brink? Wildlife biologists, conservationists, veterinary \npathologists and forensic animal behaviorists investigate some of the \nweirdest wildlife mysteries ever encountered.",
