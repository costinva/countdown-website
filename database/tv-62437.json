  "overview": "Li Fuyao, a mysteriously young storyteller, wins over the villagers with his fantastic original tales in a peaceful and secluded town. Actually, born in Luoyang City, he used to be a prestigiously selected child, who should have been cultivating in the holy palace. However, life has treated him otherwise. He was expelled to this remote town, unattended. Notwithstanding, like a hidden leopard, he is always lurking around to get himself back on the road of cultivation and seek revenge when he becomes strong enough. One day, a masterly cultivator and an injured snake demon paid him an unexpected visit, breaking the peace of his life from then on. To his surprise, the snake demon offered him a demonic core for cultivation, which granted him the chance he has been yearning for. Is it really a turning point in his life or will it just put him into inconceivable danger?",
