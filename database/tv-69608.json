  "overview": "Relaxed pacifist, matcha'addict and convinced vegan, Panda runs a small hut in a remote corner of the Camargue. No laptop, no computer, no car, he lives with his 16-year-old teenager in this perfect cocoon of peace and serenity. Alas, even in paradise, there's no way to be quiet. The day his old life comes knocking at the door, Panda finds himself forced to return to service... But in his own way. Zen, what.",
