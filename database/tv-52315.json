  "overview": "Igor Dugin works as a collector, he quickly and without unnecessary actions collects debts from Bank defaulters, taking from them everything that can be sold, and thereby close the loan. One of Dugin's colleagues makes a bet with him, offering to take on the most hopeless option — the case of the artist Lopatkin. Igor quickly finds that an old precious ring can be taken from a Bohemian poor man, but the debtor goes to the extreme step and swallows the family heirloom. Now the collector, who even has almost no time for his beloved girl, is forced not to part with his ward until Lopatkin pays his debt. And the artist during this time manages to destroy the life of the collector: quarrels with his beloved, with the boss, spoils his career, but in the end forces Igor to reconsider life priorities.",
