  "overview": "The husband is returning home from Tallinn and is having an illness. In the hospital, her dual life is revealed as the lives of two women unknown to each other begin to intertwine. Katri is a 47-year-old housewife who lives in a luxurious detached house on Kulosaari in Helsinki together with her 16-year-old son Alex. The Finnish-Estonian is the mother of 28-year-old and 8-year-old Aile. Evelin and Aile live in an idyllic wooden house in Kalamaja, Tallinn. As they search for answers to their questions, they will also reveal themselves and their own secrets to each other. How to go on living a life based on delusion or treating someone who is a reminder of fraud on the one hand and the only peer support on the other? Ahti has only left behind great grief, a company in financial difficulties and a thousand questions.",
