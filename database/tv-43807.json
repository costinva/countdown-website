  "overview": "A new district physician Martin Elinger arrives in a small village in the Beskydy Protejov to replace the original physician who suddenly died. Elinger is arrogant and ironic, but a top surgeon from Prague, and goes to Protejov also because of his aunt Marie Loukotov√°. Locals find it hard to accept his behavior. The doctor in each episode solves a different health problem and tries to fit in with the local population.",
