  "overview": "The compelling eight-part drama series Wakefield explores the fine line between sanity and madness. Set in a hospital in the spectacular Blue Mountains outside Sydney, the show tackles the taboo subject of mental illness head on. It does so through an engaging ensemble of unique characters, each with their own compelling story. At its centre is a psychological mystery: Nik Katira , a gifted psychiatric nurse, is the most stable person in what tends to be a pretty crazy place. But right now his grip on his own sanity is slipping. The question is â€¦ why? With both humour and heart, Wakefield is a powerful and highly original series that will be compulsory television viewing.",
