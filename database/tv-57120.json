  "overview": "Hands is a unique, multi-award winning series of thirty-seven documentaries on Irish crafts. Made by the renowned filmmaking team, David and Sally Shaw-Smith, it was originally produced for Irish television (RTÉ). Imbued by a sense of urgency, the Shaw-Smiths travelled the length and breadth of Ireland during the 1970s and '80s, capturing on film the final years of traditional rural and urban life. These intimate portraits are as much about the life of the individuals as the crafts they practised. The films capture the essence of Irish heritage, creating a unique archive of life in Ireland at the end of the 20th century.",
