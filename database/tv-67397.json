  "overview": "Time of Essence will tell the story of how ESSENCE has informed and reflected Black culture in America for over 50 years. Each episode explores a different decade - from the '70s to today - and features first-hand commentary on that era's biggest moments from the icons, trailblazers, staffers and leaders who lived and defined them. This candid commentary is coupled with never-before-seen footage and exclusive behind-the-scenes moments from the worlds of entertainment, sports, politics, fashion and beauty.",
