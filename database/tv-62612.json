  "overview": "In 1915 Australia, German prisoners of war, as well as Aussies of German heritage, are kept in camps. This creates many animosities toward the authorities, but in this account the camp is very relaxed in its discipline... enough that one of its prisoners, a violinist, is able to fall in love with one of the local Australian women.",
