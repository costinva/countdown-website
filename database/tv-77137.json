  "overview": "From traditional Irish stew to soda bread, fresh seafood, and boxty potato pancakes - Dermot will taste his way across the island, meeting the chefs and locals that champion and celebrate Ireland's gastronomic heritage. Having opened two of his own fish-themed restaurants and sharing some of his favourite home recipes on ITV's This Morning, he is now taking his passion on the road whilst exploring Ireland's ancient landscapes, diverse cities and stunning coastlines. From Michelin Star restaurants in the ‘Gourmet Capital of Ireland' Kinsale; to fishing for oysters by the sea in Cork; sitting down for some home-grown comfort food in Wexford; and exploring the buzz of the Dublin food scene; before venturing across to Northern Ireland and the bustling city of Belfast and beyond - Dermot's Taste of Ireland promises to be a foodie delight, full of surprises.",
