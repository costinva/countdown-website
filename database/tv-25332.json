  "overview": "Michael \"Bug\" Deakin's passion for wood and reclaimed materials began in 1970 and his company's motto is \"If you can draw it on a bar napkin, we can build it.\" The company has supplied wood to more than 70 restaurants in the Bay Area. Whether you are building a deck, upgrading or building a restaurant, needing new office furniture or buying a nightstand, you dont' have to cut down a tree to make it happen. Heritage Salvage runs like a well oiled machine – much like the Wizard of Oz, HS is a rerun, repurposing, re-using, reclaiming and re-invigorating with the rekindled brain of a Rusty Scarecrow, the transplanted heart of the Tin Woodsman and the Mustered Courage of the Cowardly Lion – we've got old wood, and it still works good!",
