  "overview": "The Japan Forensic Research Institute is co-managed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare as well as the National Police Agency. The forensic pathologists listen to the silent voices of the dead but come up against the powerful who cover up inconvenient truths. One of pathologists is the eccentric Takashi Yuzuki will pursue the truth and justice without yielding to authority. Despite failures, setbacks, betrayals and intrigue, the pathologists and their associates press on in their quest for signs of the truth left on the bodies and justice. In every case, the \"truth\" they uncover exists side by side with the \"truth\" fabricated by those with power. They find themselves in a fierce fight to the finish as both sides try to establish that their \"truth\" is the actual truth. In the midst of this, a popular singer's death leads to maneuvering behind the scenes by someone with immense power beyond imagining, and the \"truth\" that the pathologists have arrived at gets buried in darkness.",
