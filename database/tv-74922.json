  "overview": "The prince of Yan State, Yu Feichen, is married to Yin Nanyao, the daughter of the general who controls the country. The bride is a substitute killer who came to claim his life. As soon as he entered the palace, he met the prince who died suddenly and was about to be buried with him. The killer Yue Jian quickly contacted the second prince Ying in the organization, but he did not know that it was actually the prince who was killed. The prince plays two roles: fishing and law enforcement. Yue Jian was dealing with the relationship between the Prince's Mansion and the organization, becoming more and more reluctant to attack Yu Feichen. Yu Feichen, who was looking at the overall situation with two identities, was increasingly reluctant to expose Yue Jian.",
