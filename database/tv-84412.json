  "overview": "In this show, Elton, Jens \"Knossi\" Knossalla and Tim Mälzer compete as a team against real champions: Olympic champions, world champions and world record holders - the celebrities would hardly stand a chance in a one-on-one duel, but as a trio they want to rise to the challenge. Elton, Knossi and Tim Mälzer have to assert themselves against a total of ten champions. The prize for each edition is 50,000 euros. Laura Wontorra will host the new show.",
