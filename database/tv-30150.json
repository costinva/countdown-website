  "overview": "Pittsburgh, 1975. Edward Borman, a lowly government office drone, finds himself trapped when the deadly men of Mercury seize his office building as a staging ground for their nefarious plot. Aided by Jack Yaeger, a daring aerospace engineer from a mysterious organization known as \"The League\", Edward must stop the invaders and their doomsday device, the Gravity Engine. Drawing from the same retro serials that inspired such films as Star Wars and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mercury Men reintroduces audiences to the great mystery, danger, and suspense the stories were originally known for.",
