  "overview": "Documentary series in which people are helped to 'go green'. In series one, Dick Strawbridge and his family turned a neglected farm in Cornwall into a viable eco-home, and thousands were inspired to try to make their lives greener. This series follows Dick as he and his son James venture out to meet these aspiring individuals and families in cities and countryside around Britain. This programme features the Keenan family from the Wirral, who have started the construction of a large eco-house.",
