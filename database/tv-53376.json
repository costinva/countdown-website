  "overview": "Moneyball is a game show where the difference between winning life-changing money and going home with nothing rests entirely on the bounce of a ball.  Navigating their way through a series of questions, contestants can accumulate large sums of money for every correct answer. But as the cash up for grabs continues to climb, so does the pressure, leaving both players and viewers in suspense. The chance of losing it all looms large, and players may consider an early exit with the prize fund. But in a unique game show twist, they have to take one final shot, which could see them forced back into the game or leaving with their hard earned cash. ",
