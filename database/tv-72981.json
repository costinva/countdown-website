  "overview": "Following a problematic viral video involving a student, our leads are offered sixth form scholarships to St Gilbert's, in an attempt to rehabilitate the image of one of the country's oldest and most prestigious schools. They soon find themselves in a world they can only describe as something out of Harry Potter, surrounded by lush playing fields, cloistered grandeur and complex social rules which they must decipher quickly in order to survive. They will go on a journey as they learn about themselves, their identity and what it's like to live alongside the one percent - which they discover is nothing like life as they knew it.",
