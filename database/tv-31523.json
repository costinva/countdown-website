  "overview": "Alton Brown takes over the Chopped kitchen for this epic five-part tournament, Chopped: Alton's Challenge. Four competitors face off each episode to create unique and delicious dishes over three rounds - appetizer, entr√©e, dessert - utilizing the mystery ingredients with a theme, as they must impress a rotating panel of Chopped and special guest judges, including Alton himself! Ted Allen hosts the edge-of-your-seat competition as Alton influences the mystery baskets and demonstrates the science of some of the ingredients throughout the tournament. Over the course of the tournament the chefs are put to the test with challenges that tap into the science of cooking and the physics of food, with each winner from the four preliminary heats competing in the finale airing Tuesday, November 7th, with a chance to impress Alton and the judges, and go home with a $50,000 grand prize.",
