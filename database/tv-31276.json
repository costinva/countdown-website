She doesn't dare reveal her dating status to the public but she actually has a boyfriend who is equally established. They are a power couple in every sense of the word but behind closed doors is a makjangy affair complicated by a long lost sister, a mother who suffers from depression, a third wheel and even a fourth wheel that threatens to tear everything to bits.
