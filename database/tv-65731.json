  "overview": "Dr. Nick Moloney has an advantage over other Los Angeles policemen: His training as a psychiatrist helps him achieve insight into the criminal mind. Unfortunately, Nick also sometimes runs into ethical dilemmas in which doctor-patient confidentiality clashes with his duties as a cop. Lt. Matty Navarro is a friend and colleague who often finds himself at odds with Nick, while best friend Calvin, an assistant district attorney, is always available with help and advice. Nick shares custody of daughter Kate with his ex-wife, Dr. Sarah Bateman, with whom he maintains a cordial relationship.",
