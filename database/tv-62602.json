  "overview": "Bodkin is a darkly comedic thriller about a motley crew of podcasters who set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of three strangers in an idyllic, coastal Irish town. But once they start pulling at threads, they discover a story much bigger and weirder than they could have ever imagined. As our heroes try to discern fact from fiction - about the case, about their colleagues, and, most painfully, themselves - the series challenges our perception of truth and exposes the stories we tell ourselves to justify our beliefs or validate our fears.",
