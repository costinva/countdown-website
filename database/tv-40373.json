  "overview": "Dirty Sanchez daredevil frontman Mathew Pritchard is an ultra-athlete, chef, and a passionate vegan to boot. He loves nothing more than proper, tasty, delicious vegan food. Now, he is on a mission to prove that a vegan diet can make you fitter, stronger, and healthier and to show us all that his favourite food isn't all boring and bland. In fact, he wants to show us all that it can stand up to, and even better, any non-vegan meal. He's taking on the anti-vegans, one dish and one challenge at a time as he meets groups of fellow Welsh food fans who all have very different dietary requirements.",
