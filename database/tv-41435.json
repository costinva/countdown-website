  "overview": "Can two parents with four school-aged kids drop out of their busy lives and move to a tropical paradise to rebuild and restore a run-down beachfront resort? For HGTV Canada Builder Bryan Baeumler and his wife, HGTV Canada Designer Sarah, it's a huge personal and financial gamble and it's going to be the ride of their lives! After 10+ years of building a construction empire back home, Bryan and Sarah Baeumler are about to escape the daily grind and embark on an unforgettable family adventure. While on a recent vacation, they came across a vacant resort on a remote island in the Bahamas. After falling in love with the area and the locals, Bryan and Sarah decided to buy the resort and bring it to its full potential, with the end goal of running it as a business. In Island of Bryan, we follow the story of this radical life event for the Baeumlers, from a dream of creating and running a luxury boutique resort in paradise, to the reality of leaving their friends, family and life behind to take on their most challenging build yet. Is paradise really all it's cracked up to be?",
