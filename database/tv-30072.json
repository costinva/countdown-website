  "overview": "On the new Outdoor Channel series, Survival Science, Nick Mundt and Laura Schara set out to answer these questions in remarkable ways. Each week, Nick and Laura put their skills, and their bodies on the line to test the limits of human beings under the most extreme circumstances the outdoors can dish out. From animal attacks to raging storms – blazing heat to frigid cold – impossible terrain to thirst and starvation. On every episode, the adventure, excitement, pyrotechnics and danger are real, as our production team designs and builds amazing experiments to subject Nick Mundt and Laura Schara to grueling tests on Survival Science.",
