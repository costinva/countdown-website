  "overview": "Alexander is best described as a Flemish tame, low-budget version of classic British sitcom \"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\", as Alexander Verdoodt is, like Frank, a clumsy idiot who invariably messes up everything he touches. God knows what his sweet wife, also called Betsy, ever saw in him, everyone one else wisely chooses to keep well-meaning, naive good-for-nothing Alexander at arms length, or rather as far as possible.",
