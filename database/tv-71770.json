  "overview": "The country of Liulian, where women are honored, was in trouble both internally and externally. The Chief Advisor said, \"If the sixth daughter are born, the world will die.\" But General Gu gave birth to the sixth daughters. In order to save the youngest daughter, the Gu family falsely claimed to have a son. Her daughter Gu Rong was old enough to get married, so she disguised herself as a man and took her childhood sweetheart Shen Mengchui with her to marry her \"good sister\", Princess Yun. Since then, the trios had joined forces to start the battle for the throne.",
