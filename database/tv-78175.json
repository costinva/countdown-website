  "overview": "Minnie and Daisy have adventures in the great outdoors as they open their latest enterprise, Camp Minnie! They have lots of fun under the sun at this cool new campground in the woods: horseback riding, water sports, sing-alongs, s'mores by the campfire and even a wilderness fashion show. With Clarabelle as Activities Director, Cuckoo-Loca there to lend a wing, and surprise visits from woodland creatures, hijinks abound. Along the way they're joined by old friends and new, because s'more the merrier!Â ",
