  "overview": "Join Donal Skehan for a new series Donal's Real Time Recipes, as he takes to the kitchen to make recipes designed with a busy life in mind. Time not on your side? No problem- this series has the solution! From the moment you step into the kitchen to the moment you sit down with a home cooked meal, Donal will arm you with recipes for straight through cooking. No marinating, no oven, no messing –  just fast cooking that will keep you on your feet and make your kitchen work for you. Think simple family favourites where the sauce cooks while the pasta is in the pot, char grilled chicken which sizzles as you prep a simple salad, microwave greens, airfyer tricks while you make magic in the kitchen. In each episode, Donal shares 4 recipes, designed with this clever ethos in mind.",
