  "overview": "In November 1937, Shanghai fell into the hands of the Japanese army led by Wei Da Hong and Lin Qiu Yan. The underground party organization moved to underground work. In 1941, the Japanese army launched a top-secret \"Popular Beauty Plan\" in Shanghai, with the intention of using \"counterfeit banknotes\" to disrupt China's financial market and taking the opportunity to plunder China's precious cultural relics. The party's action group, headed by Wei Da Hong and Lin Qiu Yan, secretly acted, and on the way, met Tang Twenty-three, a fat man, a skinny monkey, and other young people.",
