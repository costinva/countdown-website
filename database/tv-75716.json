  "overview": "Old Tom is a one-eyed, flea-ridden, orange tomcat, who's good-natured but slothful behaviour is in contrast to the respectable, suburban matron, Angela Throgmorton, who treats Old Tom as if he were her son. They are, in reality, every bit as oddball and eccentric as each other, and together they become involved in a series of comedic adventures and topsy-turvy situations.Â ",
