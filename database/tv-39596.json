Built follows a Manhattan home design and construction service staffed exclusively with male models who are also experienced handymen.

A prominent interior designer with Hott and Handy lends her insight and expertise to ensure that the creative expectations are being met. With their different personalities and skill sets, the \"Built\" team sometimes struggles to find common ground in their work; however, their dizzying good looks bind them together and ensure a handsome ending.",
