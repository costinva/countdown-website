  "overview": "With friends like these, who needs enemies? Using hidden cameras, Disaster Dates are recorded in all their glory. They are set up by one friend who sends another buddy on a blind date, but what the dater doesn't know is that they are really being paired with an actor who is armed with personal information about their date to make them as uncomfortable as possible. Humiliation pays, however, because for every minute the date lasts, up to an hour, the dater earns a dollar.           ",
