  "overview": "They rescue seriously injured accident victims from wrecked cars and battle blazing flames. The emergency responders at the fire stations in Iserlohn, LÃ¼nen, Dresden, Potsdam, Hildesheim, and Chemnitz must work with absolute concentration, because in acutely dangerous situations, every mistake can have fatal consequences. The series follows the lifesavers in their strenuous daily work. Body cameras capture critical situations from the firefighters' perspective. This perspective provides a particularly realistic portrayal of dramatic events, such as extinguishing a fire in a smoke-filled apartment.",
