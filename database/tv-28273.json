  "overview": "MasterChef Latino sets out to find the best amateur cook whose talent and passion could transform his/her life. Many aspiring chefs will audition before the MasterChef Latino judges, but only a few will make it to boot-camp. There, their culinary skills will be pushed to the limit as only half will be awarded a place in the MasterChef Latino Kitchen, where the competition really heats up. The amateurs are whittled down as they face their toughest challenges yet. It's a life-changing journey for many, but only one will be crowned MasterChef. Produced by Endemol Shine Latino, a division of Endemol Shine North America, MasterChef is the most successful food format of all time, has been adapted in 51 territories worldwide and has been a primetime hit for over a decade.",
