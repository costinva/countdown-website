  "overview": "For centuries, brilliant minds have changed and shaped the world. But when genius is used for evil, the results are some of the most twisted, inventive, and outrageous crimes in history.This is a show about how bad things work not things working badly; the inner-workings and process behind all the stuff that's against the law. Think of it as Modern Marvels for black market, smuggling, drugs, gangs, and other crime and vice.",
