  "overview": "FROG is a modern rendering of the Golden Age of cartoons: chase &amp; run, stretch &amp; squeeze! FROG follows the zany adventures of the Frog and the Ferret, a most unusual travelling duo. The Frog is a tasty amphibian drooled over by every predator around the pond. Including the Ferret, a starving rodent who wants nothing more than to get his teeth into the Frog himself. But all over creatures vying for the Frog's flavours regularly thwart the Ferret's appetite. Consequently, the Ferret spends all his time rescuing the Frog from imminent digestion.",
