  "overview": "3 Caminos is the story of five friends from five different countries that are brought together by the Way of St. James in three particular moments of their lives. We witness how the test of time shatters dreams and makes and breaks couples and friendships, while transforming the personalities of our five main characters. 2000, 2006 and 2021, three ways, three life stages, different problems, tensions and common conflicts, played on the slightly spiritual and chaotic board of the Way of St. James.",
