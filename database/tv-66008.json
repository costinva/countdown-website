  "overview": "High school student Denis is an amateur gamer and an ordinary teenager who communicates with network users much better than with his peers at school. When the situation becomes critical, his own video game avatar comes to the rescue. IIIRAM helps the hero gain self-confidence, even if his methods are questionable and his advice is often unethical. Denis aka IIIRAM receives an offer from the world of professional eSports, and his life changes dramatically: the first money, new acquaintances and a chance to get the attention of a girl that he had never even dreamed of before.",
