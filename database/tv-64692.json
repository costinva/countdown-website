  "overview": "Bones of Crows is told through the eyes of Cree Matriarch, Aline Spears, as she survives Canada's residential school system to continue her family's generational fight in the face of systemic starvation, racism, and sexual abuse.Â The series is an expanded story from the feature film version; a truly epic tale that spans over a hundred years and multiple generations of the Spears family, the series connects and deepens the events of the past with a cumulative force that propels us into the future with power.",
