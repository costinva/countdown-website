  "overview": "Comedian Yamasato Ryota enters a cafe to prepare a story. Trivial incidents unfold there with the staff, TV people, the manager, and a handsome office worker. Little things bother them, and Yamasato's annoyance reaches its limit. He pulls up his glasses, opens his notebook, and begins to write a story featuring a real-life actress in his notebook. For Yamasato, escaping reality is a \"dream time\" where he can forget the bad things. This is the start of Ryota Yamazato's fantasy story with the latest actresses and idols as the heroines!  ",
