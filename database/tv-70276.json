  "overview": "Fronted by Editor At Large Errol Packet and Editor Clancy Overall, the pair dig deep into the controversies that shaped our nation. Across four episodes, corruption, money, religion and tribalism are key themes, with no stone left unturned to get to the crux of the headline. Australia has a history and sometimes it's not pretty and The Betoota Advocate Presents doesn't sugarcoat it. And it's why Aussies love them.",
