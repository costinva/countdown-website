  "overview": "Sent chronicles the life of an unremarkable and meek financial compliance officer, Jay Bunani, who has a habit of writing searing, and eye-wateringly honest emails to anyone who aggravates him. After he inadvertently sends out drafts of these emails that no one was ever supposed to see, his world turns upside down. He must now deal with the backlash of his actions after his carelessness cost him his job, friends, fianc√©e, and everyone close to him. Jay goes on a mission to salvage his reputation and relationships, and ends up finding out more about himself than he thought he knew.",
