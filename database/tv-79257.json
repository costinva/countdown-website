  "overview": "Sky Arts presents the inaugural Sky Arts Awards, taking place in September at The Roundhouse in London. Building on the fantastic legacy of the South Bank Sky Arts Awards, the Sky Arts Awards is the only event in the world that recognises the full spectrum of artistic genres, including classical music, comedy, dance, film, literature, poetry, opera, popular music, television, theatre and visual art. The event will also introduce the first of its kind ‘Arts Hero' category, honouring the unsung heroes whose efforts behind-the-scenes are integral to the success of the arts industry. ",
