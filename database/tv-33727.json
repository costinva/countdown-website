  "overview": "Him looking for work graduates-lawyers namesakes Julia and Yuri Zaitsev Zaitsev. Together they hired a private detective Agency. The work was weird, although much more interesting than they expected. Strange thing was that the Agency was engaged only in the search for missing people. Was the head of the Agency Vasily Mazaev in the past — the employee of one of special services.Almost all the time Mazaev spent in the office. There Mazaev met with clients. In the office there was a stand on which hung pictures of wanted. Sometimes after the meetings with customers at the booth there were new photos. Sometimes Mazaev, for whatever reason, refused to take up various cases, despite their obvious benefits.Accidentally Yulia and Yura becomes clear the hidden meaning and purpose of all activities of the Agency that was actually created only to find one person — a middle-aged woman who, judging by documents, has long died and was buried. At the same time, there's someone else who does not need her to rose.",
