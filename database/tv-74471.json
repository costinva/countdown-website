A cultural mash up of Sicilian, British, Spanish and even French culture, the cuisine and tradition in Malta offers a rich territory for Ainsley to explore! Rich culinary traditions see rabbit stews served beside mellow goat's cheese, irresistible soft bread and honeyed desserts, in a fusion of Mediterranean and Arabic influence.",
