  "overview": "Ázsia Expressz is a reality and adventure show that has been running on TV2 since 2017. It is based on the Dutch-Belgian Peking Express format. Hosted by Nora Ördög. In the first season of the Hungarian version, you have to travel from Hai Duong to Bangkok. The main prize of the game is a maximum of HUF 14 million. In the show, each couple has to hitchhike to the designated destination, which is no small task, since their speed depends on who and how they reinvent themselves in a foreign country where they do not speak many foreign languages and live in completely different circumstances than our domestic celebrities.",
