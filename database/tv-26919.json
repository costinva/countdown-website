  "overview": "Ronnie Shirley's business back home in the states has gone from black to red, so he's come to the UK to do a deal to save it in Ronnie's Redneck Road Trip. He ends up going into business with classic car dealer Anthony Kearsley and his associate, Harriet Collings, and they work as a team buying and selling cars to some extraordinary clients. Ronnie gets to grips with how business is done in the UK, and has some cultural and comedic adventures along the way.",
