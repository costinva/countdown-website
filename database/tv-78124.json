  "overview": "Follow the once-mighty King Saul as he falls victim to his own pride. A prophet prepares to overthrow him â€” anointing the outcast shepherd boy David as a second king. As Saul's fury grows, David navigates love, violence and politics in the court of the very man he's destined to replace. Two kings. One Kingdom. The outcome is war.",
