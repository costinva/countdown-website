  "overview": "Beyond the waves, beneath the surf, and into the deep blue lies the gleaming underwater world of the Mermaze Mermaidz. Light and color have started disappearing from Mystic City, so best friends Kishiko, Shellnelle, Harmonique, Riviera, and Jordie are granted a magical color change power that they must use to save their home before the city loses its sparkle for good. Follow the fabulous fins of these mermaids, each a celebrity in their own field, as they learn to control their powers, work to save the city, and meet new friends along the way.",
