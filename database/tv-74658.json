  "overview": "1977, heiress Agnès Le Roux goes missing. A look back at this criminal case and 40 years of investigation.In January 2021, recently released for health reasons and welcomed in New Caledonia by his youngest son, Thomas, Maurice Agnelet died without revealing anything about the fate of Agnès Le Roux, nor admitting his guilt. The upsetting epilogue of this extraordinary affair has therefore only partially dispelled the devastation caused on both sides by the secrecy. But the director Rémi Lainé and the journalist Pascale Robert-Diard, who dedicated the book La déposition to him , published in 2016, restore the poignant human truth of this dizzying legal saga. Alongside Patricia and Jean-Charles Le Roux, Agnès' brother and sister, and Guillaume and Thomas Agnelet, all four impressively restrained in front of the camera, the protagonists of the trials – judges and lawyers, including Hervé Temime, who died on April 10 – testify with the same commitment. Nourished by unpublished archives transmitted by the two families, this fluid and captivating documentary story has the dramatic force, but also the rigor, of a major trial.",
