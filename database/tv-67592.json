  "overview": "Lu is at the rock bottom of her life. Although she has the talent of absolute taste and the dream of becoming a sommelier, she can only do a job as a supermarket wine promoter. By coincidence, she saved the president of Anda Group, Xu Mingchen. With an unexpected kiss, the door of their destiny opens - Lu's kiss becomes the only \"antidote\" for Xu Mingchen's strange disease. In order to cure the disease, Xu Mingchen uses various ways to approach and pursue Lu Yi. The feelings between Lu Yi and Xu Mingchen gradually developed from dislike to love. Lu Yi thought she finally had the perfect love, but the love between the two of them still encountered many tests. The family's obstruction, lies, the conflict between dreams and career, Xu Mingchen's childhood friend, and so on. In the end, it tells a story of two people with vastly different identities and personalities, who meet, help each other, know and love each other under a wonderful marriage.Â ",
