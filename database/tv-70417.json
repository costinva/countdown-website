  "overview": "Iconic game show Wheel of Fortune returns as contestants once again spin to win. In this thrilling game of skill and luck, the turn of the wheel secures a cash value before they pick a letter to help them solve the puzzle. For every correct letter they reveal in the puzzle they win multiples of that amount. The pressure is on as they could lose everything at a spin of a wheel which contains ‘bankrupts' and ‘lose a turn' and the contestants' entire winnings could be wiped out.",
