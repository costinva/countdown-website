  "overview": "Moving giant brewing silos, circus big tops, ice sculptures and steam trains is never easy. However, the Ultimate Movers rise to the challenge, battling against the elements, guiding oversized transport through narrow and winding roads and overcoming problems to get their precious cargo there on time, and in one piece. Time is always money and there's no room for error.",
