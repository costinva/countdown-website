  "overview": "Finland's Independence Day celebration on December 6 is crudely interrupted by an attack to the Presidential Palace. A set of distinguished guests are taken as hostages. Security service officer Max Tanner is set as the negotiator of the hostage crisis and soon it is clear that the main target behind the terrorist attack is a plan to destabilize the security of Europe. Tanner must make bold and even painful decisions to figure out who is behind the attack. After all, there are not only human lives to protect - but the future of Europe as a whole.",
