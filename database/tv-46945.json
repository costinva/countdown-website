  "overview": "This scripted comedy series takes Australia's rich, and often surprising, history and retells it through the tipsy words of our most loved comedians and entertainers via the slightly distorted bottom of a beer or wine glass.These hilarious and skewed historic stories are re-enacted by a cast of comedic geniuses, who use lip sync to bring these dusty tales to life.",
