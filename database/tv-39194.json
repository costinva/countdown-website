  "overview": "Joy is perfectly happy with her life. It's neat and tidy and just how she likes it. Sure, her long-term boyfriend, Aidan, has left her, but Joy is fine with it. She's certainly not suffering from heartbreak and stress-induced incontinence like canine Aidan. Things are totally fine the way they are - That is until Joy unwittingly lands herself a new job filling in for Ireland's most-beloved vlogger, Flora the Happy Hunter. This unwanted promotion throws Joy firmly out of her OCD level of control and forces her to deal with a world she has put great effort into avoiding; one full of oversharing, boundary breaking, messy housemates, one-night stands, and full-contact wrestling; all in the name of learning about the crazy, uncomfortable and new-age methods people use to find - well joy.",
