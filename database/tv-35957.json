  "overview": "Once again Pascal Dupuy invites you into his busy bakery shop in Tollbugata, Oslo. In addition to exclusive snapshot of working methods and tips and tricks from Pascal itself, we become familiar with the employees and how they work. Although the chemistry is mostly good in the kitchen and around the baked dish, some still fail to adapt to the French pastry's high standard. The bakery in Tollbugata also delivers cakes to all branches, so here it becomes fast busy, hectic and sometimes dramatic.",
