  "overview": "Noel Edmonds ruled the radio waves and Saturday night TV for over 50 years, but he turned his back on it all in 2018 and travelled 11,500 miles to build a brand-new life in New Zealand with his wife Liz.Two years ago, they bought land around Ngatimoti - a small rural town - and have been building a hospitality business in the heart of the community including a vineyard, coffee cart, general store, and a restaurant and pub which is about to reopen to the public for its second season.Noel's latest idea is to build New Zealand's first energy garden, but how will his legacy project and the fledgling business cope when faced with unseasonal weather, bad press, and feelings of being an outsider? As they settle into their new Kiwi life, will Noel's spirit for adventure and his many ideas survive the challenges that New Zealand throws at them?",
