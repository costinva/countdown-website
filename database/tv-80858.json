  "overview": "In the new comedy series Bausjen we meet the six officers Eden, Kjetil, Are, Tina, Ã˜ystein and PK who make up a slightly dysfunctional, but charming, police unit in a town outside Oslo. With trust in the police at breaking point, any misstep can lead to disaster. No matter how hard they try to keep peace and order, chaos is never far away, neither at the station nor out in the field.",
