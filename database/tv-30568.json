  "overview": "The cameras are about to start rolling on the new moviemaking competition series On the Lot. Fifty aspiring filmmakers from around the globe will discover the magic of moviemaking when they are brought to Los Angeles and must endure a rigorous \"Hollywood Boot Camp\", where they will have their first attempt at a Hollywood-style \"pitch\" meeting; a \"24-Hour Film Shoot\", where each must shoot and edit a short film in a 24-hour period; as well as a \"one-page, one-hour\" film shoot, where they will have an hour to film a one-page scene with the help of professional directors of photography, camera and sound operators and actors. The 18 who make the cut will advance in the competition in the hope of landing a $1-million DreamWorks development deal.",
