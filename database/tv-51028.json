Now, inspired by years' worth of rescues, Marty Raney will attempt his greatest recue of all â€“ his very own 40-acre homestead. In an all new series, Homestead Rescue: Raney Ranch, the Raneys take on the most ambitious project the family has ever attempted, to build a multi-generational homestead.",
