  "overview": "Each episode features two to three games, and much like the original series it starts the second the contestant enters the Cash Cab. If the passenger can answer enough questions correctly before making it to their destination, they'll win big bucks. However, three wrong answers and they're kicked out of the Cash Cab and back on the street. Along the way they'll get two shout-outs--one on social media and the other via a street shout out--where the contestant can pull over and ask a stranger for help. Passengers who successfully make it to their destination simply walk away with their money or can play a double or nothing video bonus round, either going home incredibly happy or with nothing at all.",
