  "overview": "Roberta \"Robbie\" McPherson, a novelist and podcaster, is researching the cold case of Gina DeSavio. Robbie loves the chase, loves solving any puzzle or mystery. She is particularly interested in Gina's disappearance because Robbie and Gina knew each other as children growing up in a small town. Robbie is also Miles Lawrence's niece, the owner of the local paper the Harrington Chronicle, and she's about to inherit the paper.",
