  "overview": "Cheers is the Spanish version of the popular American sitcom. It was produced by Plural Entertainment and Tom Collins and broadcast by Telecinco. It was first aired on 11 September 2011, and follows the same theme as its American counterpart. Nico (Alberto San Juan) is the owner of an Irish pub named Cheers. He is a former footballer, womanizer, vain and a little bit illiterate who cannot help flirting with any attractive woman he sees in his way. Félix (Antonio Resines) is a psychiatrist, very much analytic and unsure, who is forced to look for alternative jobs. Alexandra Jiménez is Rebeca, a cultured woman who has seen herself forced to work as a waitress after her father went bankrupt.",
