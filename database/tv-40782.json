  "overview": "When disaster strikes, it's the police, paramedics, firefighters and other first responders that save the day, but the unsung heroes of every catastrophe are the guys who clean it up. HGTV provides a behind-the-scenes look of the recovery efforts of unpredictable storms and other natural disasters with its new series, Catastrophe Inc.. Long after the floods have receded and fires have been extinguished, the Catastrophe Inc. crew works relentlessly in the muck and grime to change people's lives by restoring their homes. HGTV's half-hour documentary style series features the masters of disaster clean up - licensed recovery contractors Ed Ranieri and Enzo Maddalena, designer Kari Openshaw and Joe Charboneau, former Cleveland Indians player and all around construction worker.",
