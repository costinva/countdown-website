  "overview": "Alyokha is a Cossack. He heads to strange lands in order to do the last will of his father – to honor Virgin Mary. His route goes through the palace of a Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Alyokha gets imprisoned there and becomes a janissary named Ali.  But there's no fortress that can keep hold of a free Cossack. Alyokha doesn't lose the hope to get freedom, to do the last will of his father, to fall in love and to get back to the Motherland.",
