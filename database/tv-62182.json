  "overview": "Get ready to hit the road with Bobby Flay and his daughter, Sophie, as they set off on an incredible food tour across the sunny California coastline to explore the Los Angeles spots, old and new, that are part of the city's exploding food scene. Together, they are on a mission to visit amazing restaurants and inspired chefs and enjoy the delectable and inventive cuisine created from the best the area has to offer. From glamorous Hollywood establishments to the urban revival of Downtown LA's hot new eateries, to fresh seafood in sunny beach-towns, Bobby and Sophie give us a front row seat as they share what they enjoy most, tracking down and trying the most extraordinary eats around. And with so much inspiration from their culinary travels, Bobby can't resist using the very local ingredients to cook up his own delicious dishes that perfectly reflect what LA cuisine is all about.Â ",
