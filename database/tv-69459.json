  "overview": "Martin, an ordinary nine-year-old boy, has one strange characteristic: when he wakes up every morning he awakes to find himself transformed into fantastic and legendary beings â€“ a Merlin-like wizard, a pharaoh, a caveman, a vampire, a superhero and many more transformations. Despite the transformations, he goes to school with his friends, and adventures then ensue.",
