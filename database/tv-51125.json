  "overview": "Detention starts at Greenwood High School in the 1990s. Yunxiang Liu, a transfer student, steps into the forbidden area on the campus by accident, where she encounters the ghost of Ruixin Fang. Fang later unveils the hidden history and trauma over the past 30 years, and how a group of young students and teachers were persecuted as they fought for freedom in the era of censorship. Their stories keep coming back to the school like haunting nightmares, waiting to be told and revealed.  ",
