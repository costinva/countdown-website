  "overview": "Haya is an anti-social homeless pregnant woman living in the ruins of an abandoned hotel. Ami is a police investigator who has a dark and messy case, at the center of which is a worldwide criminal organization that abducts newborn babies and traffics them through the darknet. Ami does everything to recruit Haya as an undercover agent for a fateful trip away from Israel, in the hopes that she can lead the police to the heads of the organization. The suspicion and the difficulty of getting to know each other become interdependent in the journey of their lives, which turns out to be particularly dangerous and shaky. The investigation, conducted in collaboration with the Spanish police, leads them to countless life risks, evoking wounds from the past that never healed.",
