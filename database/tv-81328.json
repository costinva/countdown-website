  "overview": "Gorgeous from head to toe! The perfect figure! To Kawai Mona, winning hearts comes as naturally as breathing... but the arrival of Kuroiwa Medaka, a new transfer student who won't even give her a second look, turns her school life upside-down! She's lived her whole life being fawned over, so why is he any different? Mona tries everything she can think of to win Medaka over, even getting a bit extreme at times!",
