  "overview": "Love, sickness, health and exam anxiety at a Danish hospital in the 50s. Erik and Anna are among the first to be accepted into a nursing school with men and women being trained together. Due to a lack of trained nurses, the Danish government decides, on a trial basis, that it is socially acceptable for a man to work as a nurse. It is not easy for the men to be accepted as nurses in an working environment with old-fashioned hierarchies and strict disciplinary work ethics.",
