  "overview": "Exploring the harrowing true story of Justina Pelletier, a 14-year-old-girl who entered Boston Children's Hospital with a mysterious set of symptoms. Quickly, suspicions turned towards the parents and Justina became a ward of the state, leaving her family in disbelief. The family called it \"medical kidnapping.\" The hospital accused the parents of medical child abuse, aka \"Munchausen syndrome by proxy.\" The battle between the two sides inspired an Anonymous computer hacker to take matters into his own hands, hurling the family into a national debate about parental rights, child protections and the gray areas in between.Â ",
