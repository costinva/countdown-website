  "overview": "\"My Bird\" is a twelve-episode story about a cool sound engineer and a mediocre stand-up comedian Liubchyk, and his wise wife Daryna, a fashion magazine editress. It's about their moving to a new apartment, about an ex, bandits, a taxi driver, about strange, sometimes even terrible life turns. And also about stand-up. And about love, too.",
