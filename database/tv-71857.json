  "overview": "In 2002 six young people seeking fame and fortune applied for a new, top secret, reality TV show. They left their homes, jobs and partners and travelled to London to start the adventure. Twenty years after their dreams were shattered, they are still searching for answers; trying to understand how a show that didn't exist, and the disappearance of the man behind it, changed their lives forever.",
