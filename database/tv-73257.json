  "overview": "The 1993 OVA is the first adaptation of the Oh My Goddess! manga, and was the first exposure to would-be fans of the series outside Japan. Its five episodes were released in-between the releases of volumes 7-10 from 1993-1994, but it does not clearly adapt any portion of the manga beyond the first episode and instead follows an original story.Theatrical movie released in 2000 continues the story of these OVA series.",
