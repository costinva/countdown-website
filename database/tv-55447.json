  "overview": "Maguy Boissier is an independent woman living in the mid-80's through early 90's. Witty and sarcastic, she lives with her likeable husband, George, and works at the town hall of VÃ©sinet, while George owns a store that sells electric household appliances. Also living with the Boisser's are their divorced daughter, Caroline, and their granddaughter (Caroline's daughter) Jerome. Maguy shares her loud, strong opinions with all of them, as well as their cleaning lady, Rose Plouhannec, whose opinions are just as strong as her's, and George's best friend, Pierre Garcin, who has military history and a tendency to get on his sister-in-law's nerves.",
