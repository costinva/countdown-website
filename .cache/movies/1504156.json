  "overview": "Solah Vincenzio returns to his hometown, accompanied by Fajrul, Jaka, and Supra. Solah imagines his homecoming will be celebrated like that of a hero but instead, he’s mistaken for a ghost. His disappointment deepens when he learns that the girl he’s long had feelings for, Dara Gonzales, is about to marry his own younger brother, Iqbal. However, their wedding is disrupted by terrifying appearances of a ghostly figure—Nenek Gayung, the corpse-washing spirit searching for her next victim to bathe. The only way to save Iqbal and Dara’s wedding is for Solah and his friends to confront Nenek Gayung and seek help from Kangmas Pusi.",
