  "overview": "The concept of the show is such that puts a group of celebrities (or subcelebrities) on a farm where they stay together for a period of three months. When the contestants are on the farm, they have to work like a normal farmer, like doing agriculture and raising animals for example. During their stay on the farm in regular periods, one of the contestants is evicted from the farm by way of a public telephone/SMS/internet vote. This process is continued until a final contestant is chosen and then he wins the prize of R$ 2 millions.",
