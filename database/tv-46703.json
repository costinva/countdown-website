  "overview": "In 2013, Massachusetts State Police arrested 35-year-old crime drug lab chemist Sonja Farak for tampering with evidence: and that was only the beginning. Over time, details emerged that Farak had been in fact using the drugs that she was tasked with testing. Did anyone know what had been going on? And when did they find out? The scope of Farak's addiction - and the number of people convicted as a result of her drug testing - comes to light, despite repeated efforts to suppress evidence in the case.",
