  "overview": "In the late 1970s, infamous serial killer the Yorkshire Ripper seemed to be taunting the police with handwritten letters and creepy tape recordings. But in fact, Peter Sutcliffe was operating in the shadows – and the police had been taken in by a very costly hoax.Hunting The Yorkshire Ripper introduces viewers to former Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Gregg, at the time a rookie detective working on the Ripper manhunt. Unable to get the hoaxer's voice out of his head, after rising up through the ranks, Gregg set out to get closure, putting together a cold case team to track down the man who – by diverting police away from the real perpetrator – allowed Sutcliffe to continue killing, leading to an interrogation room showdown decades in the making.",
