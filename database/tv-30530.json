  "overview": "For years Guy Fieri has explored America, seeking out the best spots on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Now, he is sharing that experience with his family as they hit the road for the classic American tradition - a family road trip from sea to shining sea! On Friday, August 18th at 9pm ET/PT, Guy, his wife Lori, and his sons Hunter and Ryder load up their RV to hit the road on a vacation they will never forget. From rafting in the Grand Canyon to rolling down Route 66, and from creole cooking in New Orleans to pit stops stuffed with campfire feasts, Guy's Family Road Trip is full of great food, iconic locations and big adventure!",
