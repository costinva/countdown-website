  "overview": "In The Jon Dore Television Show, Dore's flat-out, crazy take on life is told through an array of real-life interviews, off-the-wall tangents and wild antics. In each episode, he fearlessly throws himself in the line-of-fire as he sets out to correct his faults and make all his \"wrongs\" right again.",
