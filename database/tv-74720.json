  "overview": "The participants of the quiz show hosted by Gábor Gundel Takács have the task of crossing a 5-meter-high bridge built in a monumental studio from one side to the other. However, the goal - to jump 10 levels - can only be achieved if they correctly choose the one statement that is true from the statements displayed on the bridge and jump onto the space corresponding to that statement. If they jump onto a false space, the players fall into the mysterious depths.",
