  "overview": "Sonja Kljun is a young, ambitious detective, eager to prove that her refined intuition is right - the alleged suicide in peaceful Subotica hides far more serious secrets than it seems at first glance. Sonja's moving to Subotica will trigger an avalanche of events that will reveal deeply buried secrets related to the mysterious organization, but also to Sonja's past. Refined intuition is not unique to Sonja, but also to her ten-year-old daughter, whose unusual dreams related to her mother's job are beginning to come true.",
