  "overview": "Get ready for a wild ride with former NBA star Dennis Rodman on Geek to Freak with Dennis Rodman. The star uses his avant-garde style and flair to the extreme, taking willing volunteers for a walk on the wilder side of life.Each week Rodman takes ordinary people who have dreamed of releasing their inner \"wild child\" and pushes them to take on experiences that even the boldest would fear. Only the mind of Rodman could come up with the outrageous stunts that these participants must complete as a part of their transformation. He takes his devilish turn at outing a secretary as a stripper, a construction worker as a cross-dresser - taking his volunteers into bondage, oil wrestling, sex, drugs rock 'n roll...even pimping! No transformation is too radical for Rodman!",
