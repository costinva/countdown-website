  "overview": "Thirteen lucky Food Network viewers, all known for their own grill mastery, have been chosen to cook alongside the grilling guru himself in Grill It! with Bobby Flay. In each episode, the guest griller's best recipe is the food of the day. The twist is that Chef Flay has no clue about the food of choice until the guest arrives, so he has to whip up his own recipe on the fly. It isn't about the competition; it's about the opportunity of a lifetime â€“ to grill it with one of the best pit masters around.",
