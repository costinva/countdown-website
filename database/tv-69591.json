  "overview": "Ekaterina and Sergey live a prosperous life as a married couple \"with experience\": family breakfasts and dinners, housekeeping - a routine, and nothing more. An outlet for Katya was work. She teaches piano at a children's music school and works, as they say, not for money, but at the call of her soul. Katya is trying to bring at least some variety into her life, in particular in her relationship with Sergei. Turns out she's embarrassed.And Sergey is satisfied with everything as usual, and he does not notice what is happening with his wife. To top it off, Katya is fired from her job and has a nervous breakdown. Sergei, seriously concerned about his wife's condition, takes a vacation at his own expense, buys tickets to a seaside resort and takes his family to the city of his childhood. However, a family vacation on a \"last minute\" breaks the measured course of their lives and is fraught with many surprises. ",
