  "overview": "Dense and mysterious forests, vertical mountains, sweeping deserts and thriving wetlandsâ€¦ While Central Asia is densely populated, it's also one of the most vast - and last - unexplored wilderness regions on Earth. Its distinctly sublime landscapes boast the highest biodiversity of anywhere outside the tropics.Our insider, exclusive access - along with our global perspective - propels viewers into Asia's magnificent bounty of rare, charismatic wildlife through intimately told stories about unique animals. Following the superb and unprecedented approach of The Frozen Kingdom of the Snow Leopard we embark with three more iconic animals as their true dramas unfold before our eyes. And, for the first time, an international crew is on the ground to capture behavior in previously unseen locations in China.",
