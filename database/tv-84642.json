  "overview": "When the studio turns into a TNT backstage, and the guests turn into a source of truth, jokes, and a bit of drama. \"Grid\" is a podcast where the channel's stars talk about filming, premieres and everything that remains behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence is not just a background here — it provokes, analyzes, and sometimes confuses guests. In the studio — the top of the air: psychics, actors, fighters, presenters. Real conversations about television with those who make it.",
