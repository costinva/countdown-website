  "overview": "The Sound and The Fury takes us closer than ever before to rediscover the war for what it truly is: the most significant event of the contemporary world.Navigating events and continents, each episode alternates between a global approach and close-up incursions into the lives of men and women caught in the hell of World War II. From the Japanese invasion of Manchuria to the siege of Stalingrad, from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the battle of El Alamein, the series narrates World War II on a \"planet level\" to place it on a truly global scale.",
