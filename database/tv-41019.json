  "overview": "Family or Fiancé follows the dynamic between eight engaged couples who bring their disapproving families together for three days under one roof, some for the first time. The clock is ticking as the couples must decide if they're going to tie the knot, or if the nuptial hopes end there. It's a no-holds-barred look at what it's really like, when the people closest to you have major issues with the one you want to marry.",
