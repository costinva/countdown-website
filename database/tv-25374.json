  "overview": "Takes a trip down the Mississippi deep into the Louisiana Bayou for the start of their 3-month long white shrimp season. It may sound like fun in the sun, but life in the bayou ain't no day at the beach. Venice once was a thriving southern paradise, but just when these Bayou boys thought they had dug themselves out of the devastating hole that Hurricane Katrina created back in 2005, the oil spill of 2010 set them into another tailspin. Now the shrimping boats aren't the only things struggling to stay afloat. If they can't make it this season, their way of life and town may cease to exist. Feeling sorry for themselves, however, has never been an option. Between bar fights and boat fights, shrimping for food and scrimping for cash, these Ragin' Cajuns work hard and play even harder.",
