  "overview": "Watergate chronicles one of the biggest criminal conspiracies in modern politics and features a roster of some of the most important media, legal and political figures from the scandal, including Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward, John Dean, Jill Wine-Banks, Richard Ben-Veniste, and many others. The current political climate in the U.S. has triggered renewed interest in the Watergate scandal. The film explores many of the same issues being debated today on a national level, including executive privilege and the handling of Presidential misconduct.",
