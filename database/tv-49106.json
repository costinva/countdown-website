  "overview": "You can travel the world in 80 days, but you can also put a cottage in order at that time? 25-year-old Sara and 30-year-old Camilla are cousins, and along with their fathers, they have inherited Grandma's old cottage that really needs a loving hand. Over the course of 80 days, the cousins will renovate the house from head to toe so that it can form the framework for the whole family's new summer memories. Along the way, they are visited by the interior designer, Nancy Gerber, and the craftsman, Anders Koed Jensen, who come up with good advice and creative solutions that inspire the cousins. At the same time, they inspire the whole of Denmark, where many this year have the prospect of a real do-it-yourself holiday in the Danish summer country.",
