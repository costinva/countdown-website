  "overview": "From Nostradamus and the ancient Mayans to modern-day scientists, the \ntheoretical \"apocalypse\" has been the source of endless speculation and \ncountless predictions, with anything from super-volcanoes to \nmega-tsunamis, rogue planets or a massive methane eruption leading to \nthe so-called \"end of life as we know it.\" In this series, some of the \nworld's leading scientists, along with elaborate computer graphics, \nillustrate the different \"what if?\" theories of if and how catastrophic \nweather or natural disasters could possibly cause the end of days or \ntransform our lives forever.",
