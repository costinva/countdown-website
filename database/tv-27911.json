  "overview": "WWE Free for All was a professional wrestling television program produced by WWE. It served as a thirty-minute pre-show to the promotion's monthly events on pay-per-view, and as such aired freely on PPV channels a half-hour before the actual pay-per-view event started. Formerly produced under the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) banner, the original format of Free for All also featured exclusive matches in addition to the promotional content that was designed to give prospective viewers a last chance to order the event. The first Free for All was broadcast on January 21, 1996 as the pre-show to the 1996 Royal Rumble. The show was hosted by Todd Pettengill and, besides hyping the Royal Rumble, featured a match between Duke Droese and Hunter Hearst-Helmsley with the winner becoming the 30th entrant into the Rumble and the loser becoming the 1st entrant. The last Free for All match was broadcast on July 6, 1997 as the pre-show to In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede and featured The Godwinns defeating The New Blackjacks.",
