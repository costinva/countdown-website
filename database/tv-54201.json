  "overview": "Padayon is a Filipino Visayan word which means \"onward\" or \"to continue\". This is not a classic boys' love (BL) story; this one will tackle social issues. From sexual abuse, mental health problems, divorce, gender discrimination, bullying, and a lot more; this BL series is unlike any other. This, too, will represent Filipino culture as it also tackles the Filipino jeepney phaseout and other sides of our daily lives as Filipinos will be discussed.",
