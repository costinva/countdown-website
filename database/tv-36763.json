  "overview": "Sometimes when a house won't sell, the reason is right in front of you: curb appeal. When buyers just can't get past the front yard, landscape contractors Sara Bendrick and Chris Lambton help give new life to the lawn and bring order to the home's exterior. The fresh new exterior raises the home's value and gets it sold.",
