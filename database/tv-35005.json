  "overview": "Impossible Celebrities is the quiz with the third dimension: as well as right answers and wrong answers there are also Impossible answers - they are not just wrong, they couldn't possibly be right.In each episode, the celebrities must avoid giving Impossible answers as they battle it out across three rounds of Impossible style multiple choice questions. Every right answer takes them a step closer to a shot at that jackpot - but a single Impossible answer will knock them out for that episode.",
