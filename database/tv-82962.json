  "overview": "Read is accused of killing her boyfriend John O'Keefe, a local police officer. On a cold January morning in a sleepy suburb outside of the city, a local police officer named John O'Keefe was found dead on a fellow officer's front lawn. Authorities, citing a toxic dynamic between O'Keefe and his girlfriend, Read, immediately narrowed in on Read as their main suspect. They alleged Read backed into O'Keefe with her car in a fit of passion and then left him to die in the snow â€“ but Read maintains her innocence with her defense alleging something far more nefarious was at play.A 2024 trial ended in a mistrial and a re-trial is planned for April. The docuseries examines the investigation and theories through access to key figures, as well as perspective into Karen's mindset during the 2024 trial.",
