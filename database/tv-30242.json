  "overview": "Imagine the crew from Ocean's Eleven are contractors, and instead of a heist they are pulling off a major remodel - all while the homeowners are out to dinner. Just like in every caper film, our crew will need intel, a warehouse to mock up and practice the job, and time at the site without getting caught.
