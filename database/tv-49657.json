  "overview": "Since mid-2014, Ukraine has started to decentralize. This is the process of uniting villages and cities into United territorial communities, forming the region's own economy, a separate budget and local management. With the emergence of United territorial communities, previously closed windows of opportunity were simultaneously opened for many people. However, until now, not everyone has managed to take advantage of these opportunities. Our goal is to visit some of the most successful communities, talk about their success, and show how these opportunities can be used.",
