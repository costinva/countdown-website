  "overview": "A serial killer nicknamed \"The Trucker\" is on the loose in the city. He kills young women near intercity highways, takes off their shoes and covers their faces with their hair. Captain Anastasia Olkhovskaya is at a dead end - three bodies already, and no witnesses or evidence. Then a man appears who claims to know where and when the next murder will be committed.",
