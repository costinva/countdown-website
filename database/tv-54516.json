  "overview": "In a small clinic in the Uckermark, the gifted and unusual doctor Amin Ballouz fights for the well-being of his patients and at the same time against his own past. As a young man, he fled his homeland and found a new home in the Uckermark. He has a big heart, always wears a trench coat and drives a Trabi. As a doctor, he practices passionately and does not shy away from unconventional measures. His patients are his family - the hospital is his life. But suddenly he is confronted with the unexpected death of his wife. A short time after the loss, he returned to the clinic. But is he ready for it yet? Those around him try to help him find his way back to life.",
