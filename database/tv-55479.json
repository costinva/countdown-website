  "overview": "Malawi is a small African country that has made a big push to protect its wildlife. Leading the effort is American veterinarian Dr. Amanda Salb and her colleagues at the country's only animal rescue center, where injured and abandoned creatures are saved and rehabilitated. This six-part series follows the dedicated team as they care for a variety of patients, including vervet monkeys, bulbuls, baboons, hedgehogs, and many more, often working with limited resources and in dangerous conditions as they prepare the animals to return to the wild.Â ",
