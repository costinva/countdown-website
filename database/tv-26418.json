  "overview": "The water that surrounds Miami makes it an attractive paradise for residents and vacationers alike, and also a haven for dangerous snakes and overgrown reptiles. It's the threat posed by those creatures that keeps the team at Venom One busy and provides the drama in Swamp Wars. Venom One holds the largest anti-venom bank available in the U.S., and the highly trained firefighters and paramedics within Miami-Dade Fire Rescue use the anti-venoms to save countless lives each year. The Venom One team is also seen combating native species such as the eastern diamondback rattlesnake and nonnative Burmese pythons and Tegu lizards, not to mention countless alligators, iguanas and water snakes.",
