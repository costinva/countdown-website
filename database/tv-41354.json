  "overview": "On va s'aimer un peu, beaucoup... follows a trio of lawyers specializing in family law: mother and daughter Astrid and Audrey, and their colleague Sofia, three women who have dedicated themselves to preserving the privacy of issues they know from experience to be extremely delicate. From an English bulldog torn apart by his master's divorce to the marketing of sex cells, paternity and adoption issues to gender reversals, grandparents barred from seeing their grandkids to couples fighting for joint or single custody, family disputes keep piling up, and each case is unique. The only thing they have in common is their sometimes annoying, often funny, and always moving protagonists.",
