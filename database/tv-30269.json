  "overview": "In America, people from all walks of life decide to buy guns: for home protection, for sport, for their growing collections the reasons are as diverse as the customers who are profiled in the upcoming new series Lock 'N Load. The six-part, half-hour reality series offers viewers a fly-on-the-wall look at \"The Shootist\" gun store in Englewood, Colorado, where expert gunslinger Josh T. Ryan is always ready to close a sale as customers, both male and female and of all ages, steadily stream in. The series offers viewers a politically neutral peek into this family-owned gun store's daily interactions between Ryan, the inherently charming and knowledgeable salesman, and the store's most fascinating customers. The hidden camera, revealed after the transaction is completed, insures a particularly candid and revealing take on why we buy them.",
