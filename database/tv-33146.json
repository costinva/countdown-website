  "overview": "Andrey Makarov, Head of the Police Forensic Laboratory, is a real professional. He is clever, extremely well educated and possesses a fine attention to detail. It is often thanks to this attention to detail and his non-conformist methods that the most complex crimes are solved.Makarov and his group of experts work in tandem with Detective Bogdana Kovalskaya. However, Makarov is an incorrigible cynic and misanthropist, so his relationships with his colleagues are consistently tense. In addition, he has a skeleton in the closet - the reason for his return to the police after an enforced resignation is the death of his sister whom he loved dearly. Her death was recorded as resulting from an ordinary robbery, a crime which had never been disclosed, but Makarov is sure this was a premeditated murder. This time he is determined to find his sister's killer.",
