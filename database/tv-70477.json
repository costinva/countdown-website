  "overview": "Deception, lies and betrayal are the name of the game as 19 players descend on a luxury lodge, isolated from the hustle and bustle of everyday life for the chance to win up $70,000. The only challenge? Not getting ‘murdered'. Welcome to The Traitors NZ, Paul Henry's devilish little game with one main goal – find and unmask the traitors, the secret saboteurs within the group, before they take out the Faithful one by one. More than just a game, this is a battle of wits, a test of the cunning and a fight for survival. So the question is… who can you trust? 19 players. One epic cash prize. Limitless treachery and deceit. ",
