  "overview": "In Zeeman Confronts: Stalkers, Thijs Zeeman confronts (cyber) stalkers. He is supported by private detective and ex-military police, Nico van den Dries. Thijs not only addresses the attacker, but also confronts him or her with all the facts. The intended effect is to get through to the perpetrator: does he or she know what the effect of stalking is on the victim? Only if the perpetrator acknowledges his or her actions and sees the effect of this, could the stalking be stopped.",
