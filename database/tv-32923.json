  "overview": "It is not only private individuals who struggle financially, there are also thousands of Norwegian small businesses that struggle with the finances and operation of their business. This program is about the dream of starting something with two bare hands or taking over the business that has been in the hands of the family for years. More and more Norwegians are putting their dreams to life, and with the increase in the number of companies, the number of bankruptcies and forced sales is also increasing. A lot is at stake and the business owners who discover that it is not at all as easy as they thought, and risk losing everything. Fortunately, there is help available, because now the program Businessfellen comes with economists Hallgeir Kvadsheim and Magne Gundersen from Luksusfellen to help these small businesses on the right course. Economists receive expert help from entrepreneurs who have cutting-edge expertise in various fields.",
