Disney's beloved chipmunks, nervous worrier Chip and laid-back dreamer Dale, make the perfect odd couple. They're best buddies and they drive each other nuts! In their perpetual pursuit of acorns, these ultimate underdogs are joined by Pluto, Butch and other iconic Disney characters as they face down bullies great and small.",
