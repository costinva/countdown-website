  "overview": "It's the most intense police series ever. Police POV captures what it's really like to be a cop, with every wild moment caught on TASER'S new AXON camera, from the officer's perspective. All the car chases, drug busts, foot pursuits and struggles with hidden guns, just as the cops see it. You'll never look at law enforcement the same way again",
