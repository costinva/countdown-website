  "overview": "Koshiji Fubuki, whose real name was Kono Mihiko, loved singing since she was a child. When she was a teenager, she hated studying and was a tomboy and yet a very pure girl. With the encouragement of her father, she took the Takarazuka Revue's exam. Although she passed with flying colours, she could not dance and was on the verge of dropping out. However, she was gifted in singing. With her livelynature and the support of senior stars and school mates from the same batch, Fubuki went on to become a top star in male roles. After she left the troupe, she was active as a singer and actress. She worked together with lyricist Iwatani Tokiko and from the many chansons she covered such as Edith Piaf's Hymne Ã  l'amour, she was called the queen of chansons in Japan. She became an extraordinary singer who changed the history of the country's music scene.",
