  "overview": "Yellowstone is the ultimate stage for epic wolf dramas-- pack bonds, rivalries, invasions, exiles, and killings. It's also the best place to study wild wolf behavior, because you can get close enough to see the wolves as unique individuals. Follow the succession saga of these amazing wolves-- the leading ladies, the schoolyard bullies, the wily elders, the rare snow queens-- and the equally remarkable people who are devoted to them.",
