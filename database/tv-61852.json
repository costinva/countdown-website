  "overview": "Tetsuhiro Ikeda's script 'How about another cup of coffee' was interesting and I was looking forward to receiving new works every time. It complements the small story of the original and has a lot of coffee bean knowledge. I also dig into the characters of Aoyama, Tairaya, and Kakine, who were undeveloped, but there was no misunderstanding. I wanted to make it into a manga as it is.",
