  "overview": "Model Plawan has been a pad kaprao—no long beans—enthusiast all his life. Offered a hefty sum, he's hired to train in a competition at a well-known chef's table restaurant under head chef Chef Oab. His secret mission is to make Chef Oab fall for him and and to become his successor. Unfortunately, he's shaken by the harsh and stern-looking chef who smells like holy basil. Apart from being known for his skills in the kitchen, he's also said to be a serious perfectionist, instilling fear even in his peers. How, then, can amateur Plawan hope to measure up?",
