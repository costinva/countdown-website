  "overview": "Six of â€˜Alone's strongest participants from past seasons return to put their survival skills to the test for a second time. Dropped off on the frigid North Atlantic Coast of Labrador, Canada just as winter is setting in, and battling howling winds, constant rain, and North America's most fierce cold-weather predators, survivalists will set out to last fifty days in a location with the densest population of Polar Bears in the United States and face extreme conditions worse than any previous season of Alone. With just a few supplies and their previous experiences to learn from, the survivalists who go the distance will win their share of the $500,000 cash prize.",
