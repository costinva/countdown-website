  "overview": "A comedy about the journey of two friends, real homies, Malcolm and Stomil, who leave their homeland and set off to emigrate to London. On their way from a very small town to very Great Britain, they encounter a whole gallery of oddities: Gypsy motorhome dealers, anarchists-squatters, recidivists hiding from the Polish justice system or employees of a go-go club.",
