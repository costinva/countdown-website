  "overview": "In 1981, 6009 people were living in Ris√∏r. On the 28th of August, one of them goes missing - mysterious and without a trace. Six years old. Barefoor. And with an ice cream cone in each hand. The event is described as inexplicable. As if an invisible hand lifted Marianne out of this world. Is it possible to find out more about what happened - almost 40 years later?",
