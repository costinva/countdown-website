  "overview": "A slovenly underachieving student was looking forward to a laid-back high school life, free from the control of her overachieving, meticulous former class president/neighbor/overlord. Her hope was cruelly dashed when she found herself in the same class as him, yet again. To get out from under his thumb, she ran against him for class president, and won. But the demand of her new job was way over her head and sent her already hyperactive imagination into hilarious overdrive looking for creative solutions to her problems.",
