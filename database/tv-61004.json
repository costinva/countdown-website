Worried about his younger sister's fascination of the popular idol Lu Lin, Jiang Yifeng trolled him on the Internet. As his comments catch Lu Lin's attention, the two meet after a hostile abduction. At this moment, all Jiang Yifeng's perceptions became normal, and his heartbeats are racing for this young man standing in front of him.",
