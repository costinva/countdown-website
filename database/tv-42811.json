  "overview": "Think you've got what it takes to survive two months of Boot Camp and win $500,000? At this Boot Camp winning is not just a matter of who is physically strongest, or mentally shrewdest. It's a game of endurance and elimination, where your ally could be your worst enemy, and every strategy -- including alliances -- is inherently flawed. Boot Camp begins with a squad of 16 recruits, both men and women, who endure a real-life, Military boot camp run by four former Marine Corps drill instructors (DIs), three of whom are still active Marines. Each week one squad member is voted out by his fellow recruits. In a dramatic twist, the dismissed squad member then chooses another recruit to leave the game with him or her...any recruit, for any reason; no one is safe. During each episode, the recruits elect a squad leader from within their ranks. Each week, the squad must complete a mission that tests mental ability and physical agility. Led by a different squad leader each week, the recruits push themselves to limits they never imagined as they attempt to complete their mission, reap the rewards of success and remain in Boot Camp. At the end of each episode, two squad members are eliminated until the final two compete in a gruelling 48-hour marathon called the \"Gauntlet.\" During the \"Gauntlet,\" the two recruits undergo mental and physical test of endurance, strength and will as they vie for the cash prize.",
