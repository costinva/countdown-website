  "overview": "Po has just been dumped by Earn, his boyfriend, because Po is not as successful as him. Po swore to himself that he would never meet someone like Earn again. However, working as a documentary director led him to meet Thame, the leader of the number one idol group MARS, who was about to leave his bandmates to succeed alone in Korea. The group had to disband, and Po branded Thame as no different from Earn.However, the more Po got to know Thame as a human being, and not an \"idol,\" the more he realized that Thame was not the person he thought. Po wants to help Thame get his friends back, whether it's Nano, Jun, Dylan, or Pepper. Along the way to save MARS, Po accidentally falls in love with Thame, even though he knows that idols can't fall in love... and this feeling may be an obstacle for the group. But what if Thame also wants to love Po? If he doesn't care about those rules and loves Po, will the world collapse?",
