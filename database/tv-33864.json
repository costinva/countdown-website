  "overview": "Dancing with the Stars judges and renowned choreographers Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba will put their reputations on the line as they search for America's most talented amateur performers - who can both dance and sing -- in a massive nationwide hunt. They'll create two rival teams and battle it out on the dance floor to form the ultimate performance group, on Dance War: Bruno vs. Carrie Ann. Pop sensation and Dancing with the Stars Season Two champion Drew Lachey hosts the six-week primetime reality series. After the audition show, Dance War goes live with the top 12 contestants divided into two teams. Captains Tonioli and Inaba will mentor their teams through spectacularly-themed song and dance numbers ranging from Latin to Pop and Country. The fate of the teams is in the hands of viewers who will vote for their favorite group each week. The captain of the lowest scoring team -- whether it be Bruno or Carrie Ann -- will face the dilemma of having to choose one of their performers for elimination. The champions will win a life changing prize - they'll go on tour as the opening act for a major performing artist and a chance to start a thrilling career as part of a brand new all-dancing, all-singing act.",
