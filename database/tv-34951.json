  "overview": "The Naked Brothers Band is an American musical comedy series. The show depicts the daily lives of the Draper boys, who lead a faux rock band from New York City. As a mockumentary, the storyline is a hyperbole of their real lives, and the fictional presence of a camera is often acknowledged. Lead vocals and instrumentation are provided by the siblings; they wrote the lyrics themselves.",
