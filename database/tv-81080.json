  "overview": "Sun is a womanizer who breaks women's hearts for a living. This time, he is hired to break Sairung's heart. She is a reporter for an online news agency. Sairung is bright, confident, and sexy. The next day, he meets her again. But her personality has completely changed. She becomes quiet, cold, and unfriendly. Moreover, she doesn't recognize him even though they met yesterday. Sun finds out that her strange behaviors are similar to those who have multiple personality disorders. In total, she has five different personalities.Sairung's father, Thepchai, who secretly hires Sun, stumbles upon an unproven theory: if every personality falls in love with the same person, the identities may reunite into one. Armed with charm, wit, and every trick in the book, Sun takes on the challenge of making each version of Sairung fall for him. Will he succeed?",
