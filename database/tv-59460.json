  "overview": "An emotionally and physically intense glimpse into the lives of teenage girls at the wilderness campus of an exclusive girls boarding school, the series takes us inside a brutal world, exploring latent and emerging sexuality, ritualistic rites, intense friendships, gruelling physical punishments, shifting loyalties and a ruthless struggle for power. Played out across past and present timelines, the series reveals that even 10 years on from their school years, no one has escaped unscathed â€“ and most are scarred for life.",
