  "overview": "The Carters followsÂ bona fide American teen heartthrobs, Nick and Aaron, who seemed to have it all, but behind their remarkable gifts was a family dealing with mental health struggles, drug addiction, and heartbreaking neglect. Their story is told by Aaron's twin sister, Angel, who unpacks the complicated family dynamics that led to the untimely deaths of three of the original five Carter kids as well as their father. The often enchanting but ultimately painful story of these engaging siblings begins in childhood as home movies reveal Nick and Aaron's undeniable and precocious talent. But fame and fortune were accompanied by rivalries, jealousies, and exploitation from those they relied on most, their parents. It is a sad and eye-opening tale shared by Angel and close family friends who also live in the spotlight including Melissa Joan Hart and Scout Willis. The film features exclusive interviews with those closest to the family, some who have never spoken out before.",
