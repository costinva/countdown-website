  "overview": "The Last Train was a gripping six part post-apocalyptic drama series. The plot concerns the survivors of a catastrophe (namely the Earth being hit by a giant meteorite) who were cryogenically frozen in a railway carriage, due to the actions of a scientist called Harriet Ambrose. The series follows their adventures in the devastated new world, where everything they had known is now dead and gone. Harriet leads the group and insists they must reach 'Ark' to find help. Other principal characters included mother of two - Jandra, impulsive Ian Hart, bad boy and former criminal Mick Sizer and sensible Roe Germaine.",
