  "overview": "6.30 pm is the time at which Eric and Melissa, two colleagues, leave the office each day to go to the same bus stop. Five minutes a day, wedged between work and family life, sketching out the year that will see these two looking for, finding or missing each other. More than just a matter of time, 18h30 is above all a setback.",
