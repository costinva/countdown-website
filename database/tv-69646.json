  "overview": "Much like the ukay (secondhand) clothes that she sells, Melanie was also \"discarded,\" abandoned by her own mother when she was a baby. She dreams of making it big as a fashion designer, to prove her worth and show her mother that she should've never left her. She finds the opportunity of a lifetime when a handsome young fashion executive, Chris, takes notice of her talents. As Melanie steps into the fast-paced and cutthroat world of the Filipino fashion industry, she also finds herself on a journey towards self-awareness, empowerment, forgiveness, and the possibility of true love.",
