  "overview": "White bear cub Umka with his mother Bear lives in the harsh and beautiful Arctic. He has wonderful friends – the mischievous wolf Ilma, the cute seal Bark and the funny pink seagull Pychik. And Umka's most important friend is the Chukchi boy Taike. The boy and the animals explore the wonderful world of the North together and learn to respect nature and each other. Stories about Umka and his friends are told on behalf of an adult Thai who grew up and became a Shaman. His fairy tales are imbued with the spirit of the Arctic and its legends – kind, instructive and wise. ",
