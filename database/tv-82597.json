  "overview": "Stadium game day in Cleveland, Ohio, is an electric, cathartic, emotional experience shared by 67,000 die-hard fans coming together inside this city within a city. Protecting them is a highly trained force of nearly 1,000 brave and dedicated men and women from law enforcement, multiple private security agencies and medics from the nearby hospital. This new series provides unprecedented access to the stadium's command center where more than 500 CCTV cameras are monitored in real time. Whether it's large-scale brawls, lifesaving resuscitations, or heartfelt reunions with missing children — viewers get a behind-the-scenes look, as officers and medics are dispatched on hundreds of calls including instances of fans breaking the strict code of conduct, resulting in ejection or worse — a one-way ticket to Stadium Lockup.",
