  "overview": "The Repair Shop is a workshop of dreams, where broken or damaged cherished family heirlooms are brought back to life.Furniture restorers, horologists, metal workers, ceramicists, upholsterers and all manner of skilled craftsmen and women have been brought together to work in one extraordinary space, restoring much-loved possessions to their former glory.Many of these items have incredible stories behind them and a unique place in history: from an accordion played in the Blitz by a woman who is now in her 90s, to a beautifully crafted clock made by a father who was completely blind; a Pinball machine that is currently being used as a kitchen counter, and a Davenport desk with its trademark fake drawers which fooled burglars - and their crowbar.The Repair Shop is an antidote to our throwaway culture and shines a light on the wonderful treasures to be found in homes across the country.",
