  "overview": "The singer-songwriter Mat is facing a mental crash. Actually he is sufficiently successful, has a steady relationship, is not unhappy with his life. There he meets Monika: She is \"efficient, organized\" and in the process of earning a promotion - Monika is a \"moderate depression\", namely Mats. Her current assignment to make life difficult for Mat becomes unusual when he begins to see his depression: That has never happened to Monika and that is not intended! That's supposed to happen to schizophrenia, but not to depression like you. Can it cost her promotion? For his part, Mat does what one should do when seeing non-existent people: he tries to get rid of these hallucinations as quickly as possible.Â ",
