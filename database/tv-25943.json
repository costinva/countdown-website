  "overview": "Way back when The New Kids were cool, they had their own short-lived Saturday morning show. Appealing to rabid teenage girls, this show dealt with The New Kids trying to run away from fans and get to the gig on time. This show is considered a cheesy cartoon classic and lives on in the hearts of many.",
