  "overview": "Military veterans Andy and Ashley Williams are the newest expert flippers featured in an HGTV Flip or Flop spinoff. Flip or Flop Fort Worth follows Andy, a real estate agent and home renovation expert, and his wife, designer Ashley, as they purchase some of Fort Worth's most rundown properties and transform them into stunning family homes. The couple, who met while serving in the United States Armed Forces in Iraq, are also the parents of two young children. \"Each property we buy has its own unique problems\", said Andy. \"Ashley and I have learned that when doing a flip, we need to make the best use of the home's space. This is the most critical change we can make to add the most value\". During the series, Andy and Ashley take the fixer uppers down to the studs while saving the original features that will most appeal to buyers. The series also will highlight the duo's commitment to hiring fellow veterans to assist on their projects, including landscape designer Andrew Turner who helps Andy and Ashley add curb appeal to several homes during the season. \"Our flips can get a bit chaotic\", said Ashley. \"But that's good when flipping a house because it means things are rolling and you're getting closer to selling the home for top dollar\".",
