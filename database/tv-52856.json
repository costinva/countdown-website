  "overview": "This series from Blumhouse Television zeroes in on America's most notorious and outrageous killers from the Sunshine State. Often referenced as \"Florida Man\" in headlines, these killers commit bizarre and outlandish crimes that captivate the nation and sometimes feel as though they're straight out of a Hollywood movie.â€¯ With the aid of Florida investigators and prosecutors, the series unravels the cases' strange twists and examines what drove these killers to commit attention grabbing murders brutal enough to mistake for fiction. The premiere episode follows the case of Michael and Susan \"Missy\" MacIvor, a newlywed couple found brutally murdered in their home after a tropical storm rips through Tavernier Keys, FL.",
