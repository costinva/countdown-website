  "overview": "Fam is about a woman whose vision of a perfect life with her adoring fiancé and his wonderful family is radically altered when her 16-year-old, out-of-control half-sister unexpectedly comes to live with her. Clem's upbringing and teen years left a lot to be desired, but she pulled herself up, and built a fantastic life—great job, terrific apartment, and an amazing fiancé, Nick, a college professor from a well-to-do \"normal\" family. Nick's warm and supportive parents, Rose and Walt, embrace Clem and complete the family she always wanted. But when Clem's wild-child half-sister, Shannon, appears on their doorstep to escape their train wreck of a dad, Nick agrees that Clem can help her avoid all the mistakes she made, and they invite her to move in. As the family Clem chose and the family she has blend, Clem realizes that this happy fam may be the perfection she's been seeking.",
