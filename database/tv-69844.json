  "overview": "The main character of the series Rudi und Trudi is the raven Rudi, already known from \"Siebenstein\". In \"Rudi und Trudi\" he reappears as a cartoon character and at the beginning of each episode embarks on a flight to an unknown, often fantastic world full of adventures and surprises. Rudi often gets himself into trouble when looking for glittering objects, unusual places and unexpected delicacies. Luckily, the cheeky and fearless raven Rudi has his well-groomed and clever friend, the kitten Trudi, at his side on every expedition. So if Rudi usually puts himself in danger head over heels, Trudi, clever and far-sighted as she is, can avert the worst from her best friend. Trudi even accompanies the raven Rudi under water, even if she naturally abhors this element. In any case, the raven and the kitten are an unbeatable team on all their expeditions into enticing and unknown worlds.",
