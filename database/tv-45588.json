  "overview": "The two-part series Lost Home Movies of Nazi Germany delves into the private collections of Germans, both civilian and military, who recorded the dawn of an empire that they thought would last a thousand years. These rolls of film reveal a different side of Hitler's Third Reichâ€” both at home during peacetime and on the front lines of the war. It is a candid look at what life was really like for those living in, and under Hitler's Swastika - at home - and abroad, a record not only of what they saw, but of what they knew.",
