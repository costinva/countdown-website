  "overview": "Pulling from an archive of more than 10,000 interviews recorded over nearly 50 years, David Frost Vs centres on era-defining interviews conducted by legendary broadcaster Sir David Frost. Seen through Frost's eyes, we encounter the flashpoints of the mid-to-late 20th century that made it a furnace of change and uncertainty, tumultuous times that continue to permeate our world today.Across the series, Frost's career acts as a roughly chronological spine, as we journey through recent history via his astonishing rise, with commentary and insights from the Frost family and famous faces who knew him best. Each episode is anchored around Frost's interviews with one key personality, providing a jumping board into deeply resonant themes; from explosive encounters with Muhammad Ali on African American civil rights, to the deeply divisive student protest movement against the Vietnam War framed through Frost's conversations with Jane Fonda, and exploring the dark side of fame via revealing interviews with Sir Elton John.",
