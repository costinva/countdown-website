  "overview": "We get an open and action-packed meeting with \"the world's fastest family\", where everything is about motorsport and everything is 110% or nothing. Daddy Petter is a real rally legend, mum Pernilla is a former rally driver and now manager and organizer of Team Solberg. Teenage son Oliver has not only inherited his father's charm and radiance - he also looks to be an even better driver.",
