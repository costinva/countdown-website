  "overview": "This new series features the fascinating stories of three of the most important commercial aircraft ever to take to the skies. A supersonic spy plane that can reach Mach 3 and the very edge of space. A seven-story, flying double-decker that can carry up to 853 people. And the Holy Grail of aircraft design that revolutionized air travel as we know it today. These are the amazing journeys of three planes that changed the world: the SR-71 Blackbird, the DC-3, and the Airbus A380. Each extraordinary plane has an extraordinary story to match, including big gambles, brilliant minds, maverick figures, and life-threatening challenges.",
