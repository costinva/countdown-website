  "overview": "During filming of a play about a legendary sword by the name of Si Yun, an actor, an actress and a movie-investor is sucked into the play itself. In this alternate world the actor Zhou Lou Chen and the actress Xu Yi Nuo, who normally dislike each other, are now the legendary Sword Saint and his wife. In order to be able to return to the real world again, the \"couple\" has to participate in a competition to acquire Si Yun along with several other skilled martial artists. But they soon realize that there seems to be a hidden agenda and unknown forces are already trying to ruin the couple's chances of winning and that they will have to rely on each other to succeed. The appearance of the movie-investor Song Ning Yan as one of the fellow competitors complicates matters even more.",
