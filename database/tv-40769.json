  "overview": "In each episode, a couple is given $25,000 to make over three rooms of their house. But, before they make any design decisions, they're told that she has to move out of the house for three weeks, and he's left to handle the renovation alone - leaving her to wonder how well he knows her taste. While he's struggling to make it work, she meets with Ryan to create her dream space in a replicated room, the \"doll's house.\" Finally, both looks are revealed and they discover if their style choices are closely married or worlds apart.",
