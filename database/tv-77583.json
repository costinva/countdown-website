  "overview": "In the 1980s, the top student of the police academy, Du Xiang Dong, was assigned against his wishes to a detention center. Two suspects escaped from the jail; one died, and the other got away. Du Xiang Dong blamed himself and impulsively resigned. For the next twenty years, he found himself in a battle of wits with the escaped suspect, Xu Wen Geng. Both followed their own ways of life, engaging in a strategic duel amidst the tides of the times.",
