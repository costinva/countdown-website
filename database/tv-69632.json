  "overview": "Kalli is still small, no big, about 5 years old. At night, when he's lying on the bed, sitting, or hopping around, you know he's not ready to go to sleep and like all children, he doesn't want to go to sleep yet. Everything that happened during the day goes through his head. In order to \"process\" the experiences, Kalli transforms and slips into another role: captain, kangaroo, dump truck, his imagination knows no bounds. Experienced in a playful way, deepened, he solves situations that previously made him sleepless. As befits good night stories, the blond boy is a little hero and each of his adventures has a happy ending. Kalli can sleep peacefully. The first \"Kallis Good Night Stories\" started broadcasting in 1998 in the sandman program. They still attract attention today because of their design, a collage trick. Andreas Strozyk is the graphic designer, he also directed. For all fans: He also penned the pirate stories with Rasmus Rotbart and Black-headed Gull Lawina. There are now 52 Kalli stories, produced by Koppfilm GmbH, Berlin and by MotionWorks GmbH, Halle (Saale).",
