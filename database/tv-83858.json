  "overview": "Rather than focusing solely on the identity of the killer, Jack the Ripper: Written in Blood delves into how the Whitechapel Murders fuelled the rise of tabloid journalism in Britain. The series shines a light on one newspaper in particular – The Star – and its shameless exploitation of the killings to boost circulation and profits, hindering the police investigation to further its own agenda. Through the eyes of present-day experts, this gripping series immerses viewers in the turbulent Victorian era, offering a unique perspective on how the press manipulated the story for its own gain, ultimately obstructing justice in the process. Through the eyes of present-day experts – including investigative journalists, former detectives, psychologists, historians, a former prostituted woman and author, and forensic experts – this gripping series immerses viewers in the turbulent Victorian era, offering a unique perspective on how the press manipulated the story for its own gain, ultimately obstructing justice in the process.",
