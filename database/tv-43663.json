  "overview": "World War II - the largest, most destructive conflict mankind has ever known. Decisive battles, both epic and complex, played out against a vast landscape across the globe. Many of these operations have been misinterpreted, lost in the fog of war or consumed by the landscape. Using remote sensing techniques (including LiDAR, photogrammetry etc), each episode tells the story of a WWII battle or campaign and will hopefully even changes some of the accepted truths documented in military files or veteran testimonies.",
