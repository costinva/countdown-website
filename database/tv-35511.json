  "overview": "Dark Mon£y sees an ordinary London family decide to accept a substantial pay-off from a renowned filmmaker to keep silent about the abuse of their youngest son. Although guilt-ridden, they believe the money will enable the family to heal and move on, to start a new life and erase the memories of the past. But damage runs deep, and the price of taking the money may be very high.",
