  "overview": "Traffic accidents and resuscitation, but also elevator confinements, escaped animals and entrapments: the fire brigade does so much more than just extinguish fires. Als de brandweer shows the work of the Dutch fire department and shows what it is like to be in the shoes of these heroes when they head for an incident from a barracks. What starts in the emergency room with a frightened emergency call is given a follow-up if they get into the tanker syringe within one minute and blow out with screaming sirens. Never before have viewers come so close to the fire. They experience everything through the eyes of the firefighters, who portray their work themselves with different cameras.",
