  "overview": "Eight Days That Made Rome is a docu-drama that leaves behind the conventional chronologies of Rome's thousand-year history and brings razor-sharp focus to eight days that created, tested and defined its greatness.Each programme works as a stand-alone, as strong in its own right as part of a series and reveals a Rome relevant to us today, with its noblest and darkest instincts still resonating in the world around us. On-screen presenter Bettany Hughes discovers the significance and resonance of these Eight Days along with us, the viewer, as she explores key sites in Rome's empire and meets expert witnesses on subjects ranging from psychopathy to ancient religion.",
