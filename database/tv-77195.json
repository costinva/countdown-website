  "overview": "Street magic meets hip-hop music in this series, which features magician Tomas B. De la Cruz Jr. -- aka Smoothini -- wowing today's top artists with his unique tricks. He meets guests including Lil Jon, Waka Flocka Flame, Fat Joe, Iggy Azalea and Becky G, and by disarming them with his slight of hand, he gets to know them and reveals something about each artist that even the most ardent fans didn't know. Episodes conclude with Smoothini, who has appeared on \"America's Got Talent\" and entertained crowds for years in Las Vegas, unveiling a custom-designed illusion for the artists.",
