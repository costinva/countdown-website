  "overview": "The world is thrown into chaos when the public learns that in just ten days' time, a massive meteorite will hit the Earth, likely wiping out the entire human race. This horrific news has sent a young man working in a dead-end office job named Masumi Nishina (Seto Toshiki) into shock. But he soon makes peace with his destiny and decides to return to his college library, where he intends to read books in a tranquil setting while he waits for the end to come.But this decision proves to be a major mistake – as it is here he is reunited with the man who ruthlessly broke his heart: Ritsu Kusakabe (Nakata Keisuke). Back in college, they were both in the same publishing club, but parted ways bitterly. Masumi Nishina had hoped he would never have to set eyes upon Ritsu Kusakabe again, so cruel was the latter's rejection, while Ritsu Kusakabe went on to become an IT hotshot. But with the clock ticking and just days remaining until the world comes to an end, they start to wonder if they should perhaps reignite their romance...and fill the remainder of their lives with passion.This drama was based on a hit manga series of the same name by Marukido Maki.  ",
