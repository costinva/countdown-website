  "overview": "Britain Afloat explores the regional distinctiveness of boat design and the floating way of life, from the modest coracle - whose shape was adapted to suit individual rivers across Britain - to the imposing Thames sailing barges - boats that helped build London. Mary-Ann Ochota travels the waterways of Britain, discovering how boats have shaped our lives.",
