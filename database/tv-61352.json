  "overview": "Matayoshi's unrivaled chair enthusiast, who has also served as the editor-in-chief of \"Matayoshi Naoki Magazine Chair\" in the past, has turned into a drama in the newly written story! As the title suggests, it becomes a unique omnibus drama (8 episodes in total) that depicts the life of a woman and \"chair\", and one real famous chair appears in each episode, and the story also describes the origin and characteristics of that chair. It is an original story woven and spun. It is finished in eight stories about unique and mysterious &lt;chairs and women&gt; with abundant variations, and Matayoshi himself, who wrote it, reveals that it is a strange story that I have never seen ... How is the whole story? One of the highlights of the work is that Riho Yoshioka, Serena Motola, Natsumi Ishibashi, Haru Kuroki, and the four leading actresses play two completely different protagonists. We hope that you will enjoy the acting that swings to the extremes of the talented actors who have high acting ability.",
