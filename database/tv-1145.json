  "overview": "In order to Beat Bobby Flay, you have to get to him first. This new series is the ultimate throwdown-showdown... . Three culinary masters, each with their own signature dish, a dish that they'd stake their reputations on, travel to New York for the chance to challenge Bobby Flay to a head-to-head cook-off of their specialty. But first, these contenders must battle it out to see who has the culinary prowess to ultimately go one-on-one against Bobby on his own turf.",
