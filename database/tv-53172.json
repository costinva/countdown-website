  "overview": "Foodtastic is a build competition series, where teams of contestants are challenged to create whimsical, larger-than-life, Disney-inspired works of art made out of all types of food including everything from cheese and butter to fruits and vegetables. In each self-contained episode, three teams of food artists transform iconic characters into extravagant masterpieces that tell a story from Disney's legendary IP. These food sculptures will be judged purely on their design, technical skills and narrative, and not by taste. Unused food from each competition will be donated to local food banks.",
