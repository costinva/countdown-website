  "overview": "The first-ever spoiled, unjust, and overly cunning unconventional hero in drama history just might have been borne!Heroic main character Mitsuhashi, who sports a perm and blond hair, goes by the credo, \"I will win no matter what it takes!\" Yet for a main character, he is rather unjust, conniving, and calculating! Perhaps these descriptions make him seem like a despicable person, but it is actually quite satisfying and refreshing to see this sharp-thinking fellow beat the heck out of every single bad guy that appears.",
