  "overview": "10 amateur photographers the chance to live out their wildest fantasies in pursuit of their ultimate dream: to become the next great fashion photographer. Our cast will live and work together in a downtown L.A. loft while being guided by world-renowned fashion photographer Russell James. These aspiring photographers will embark on a series of photo shoots meant to challenge their creativity and expose their individual weaknesses. For the first time in their lives, the cast will work with supermodels and high-end professionals, while traveling to exotic locations -- all to capture that one perfect shot. Whether it's shooting on the deck of a schooner in the midst of a storm, or trying to get a supermodel to cuddle up to a Siberian tiger, our cast will face daunting tasks and obstacles that will test their talent, desire and drive to be the next great fashion photographer. Each episode will contain a \"teach challenge\", where Russell presents the cast with a new technical or creative lesson, and a photo shoot, in which the cast will be asked to utilize what they've learned in a legitimate, fashion-oriented photo campaign. Each week Russell and his professional panel will review the cast's photos, eliminating the weakest shooter. After a month long journey the best photographer will emerge and be crowned the show's winner, thus launching his or her professional career. 10 aspiring photographers...30 grueling days...1 shot at a glamorous life in the world of high end fashion photography.",
