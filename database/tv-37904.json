  "overview": "On the heels of what's become a national phenomenon with paranormal activity and metaphysical realms, TLC will premiere Ghost Intervention a four-part docu-series that chronicles a case manager and a team of women with psychic abilities as they try to help different families who are struggling with paranormal activity in their homes. In each hour-long episode, the women use their psychic abilities to read each of these homes, before they even meet the families who live in them. When the families actually sit down with our paranormal team, they realize that their uncanny talents are exactly what they need in order to finally find the source of psychic conflict and rid their lives of the lingering negative spirits.",
