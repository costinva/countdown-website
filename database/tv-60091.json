  "overview": "The show \"Ne drogni!\" is a Russian version of the British project Flinch, which was originally broadcast on Netflix. Participants of the new extreme show will have to demonstrate a steely character and iron endurance in order to win the winner's cup and the status of the most unflappable hero. And they will be supported by star hosts: Mikhail Galustyan, Artur Babich and Valya Karnaval. According to the rules, in each of the four tests, the hosts choose one ward for themselves. The task of the participants is not to flinch, even if it is very scary. Each flinch brings the hero a point. The one who flinches the least number of times will become the winner, and the host whose wards scored the most points is forced to take the test himself. The creators of the show decided to show real daredevils from the people, so among the participants of the project you can meet a variety of people: from the winner of the Miss Belarus contest and a sex coach to a teacher and a former priest.",
