  "overview": "Two armed revolutionaries hijack and threaten to blow up Flight 601 unless the Colombian government releases 50 political prisoners and pays them a large cash ransom. Faced with political leaders' refusal to negotiate, the aggressors make drastic decisions that will jeopardize the hostages' safety as the plane flies aimlessly. Amid the impending horror, the captain and two brave stewardesses must fight to return the hostages safely and outwit the hijackers while negotiating with the authorities. This is a breathtaking thriller inspired by true events that took place on May 30, 1973.",
