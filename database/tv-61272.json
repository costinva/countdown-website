  "overview": "Leaving a trail of lies and deception in her wake, the police and her victims are left to piece together the mystery of who Melissa Caddick really was. To those closest to her, she was a daughter, wife, mother, and loyal friend. But as the pieces of the puzzle begin to crystallise and the police close in, a decomposing foot with an Asics running shoe still attached washes up on a sandy beach and turns everything about her disappearance on its head.",
