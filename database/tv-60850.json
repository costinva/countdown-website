  "overview": "Join Blippi in his Treehouse and meet his best friend Meekah and critter-friends Scratch and Patch. Curiosity abounds as they ask questions of the world around them, are visited by neighborhood experts (meteorologists, paleontologists, athletes and more!) and go on exciting field trips. We will sing, dance, and even see animated Blippi exploring places he has never been before!Â ",
