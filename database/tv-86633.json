  "overview": "On the roof of a high-rise building, four Kyivites Lara, Elka, Yulia and Susanna meet the dawn after graduation and decide to live \"Here and Now\", without waiting for better times. Each of the girls dreams of her happy future, investing in these dreams various things - death, glory, freedom, justice. Over time, they will realize that saving others from death is where they find the most meaning in life, true love trumps fame, and absolute freedom can collide with selfishness.",
