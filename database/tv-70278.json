  "overview": "Mizuki Segasaki is an up-and-coming weather forecaster who seems like a mild-mannered man, but beneath the placid surface he is a tyrant at home. This fact is well known to pornographic manga artist Yoh Tanada, who lives with him. Although Segasaki provides for all of Tanada's expenses, the only condition for this deal is that Tanada needs to obey Segasaki's every wish!Â ",
