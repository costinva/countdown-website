  "overview": "A protagonist, rebellious and apparently unfit for the role of head of the children's neuropsychiatry department, but with an intuition out of the ordinary and with a marked empathy towards patients. This is Tosca (Gabriella Pession), ironic, direct, provocative and who loves life, despite her suffered soul. A story that brings together a new and charismatic female character with stories of touching and very particular teenagers.",
