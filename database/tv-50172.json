  "overview": "At 45, with her law degree in hand, Claire Robin puts her old life as a florist behind her for good. Confronted with the prejudices of an elitist corporation, Claire is expected at the turn. His niche? Everyday justice, the one that really helps people. His first case? She is not short. She will have to get a family out of the spiral of over-indebtedness, desperate in the face of the arrival of the bailiffs. But will that stop Claire for all that? Of course not ! His method? Talent, improvisation and... a lot of nerve.",
