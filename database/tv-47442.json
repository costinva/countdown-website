  "overview": "Grant tells the remarkable and quintessentially American story of a humble man who overcomes incredible obstacles, rises to the highest ranks of power and saves the nation not once, but twice. With a seamless blend of dramatic scenes, expert commentary and beautifully enhanced archival imagery, this series uncovers the true legacy of the unlikely hero who led the nation during its greatest tests: The Civil War and then Reconstruction - the herculean task of reconciling the North and the South. During this time, Grant acted as a pillar of strength when our country suffered its greatest-ever loss of American life. One of the most courageous and unexpected initiatives of Grant's presidency was protecting the right to vote for the four million formerly enslaved people freed at the end of the war in the face of violent and widespread resistance. Grant features on-camera interviews with top experts in the field including Ron Chernow, retired United States Army General and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director David Petraeus, acclaimed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates and professor of English at West Point Elizabeth Samet to name a few.",
