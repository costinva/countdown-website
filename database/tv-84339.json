  "overview": "Sri Lanka is one of the most bio-diverse places on the planet but it's also home to one of the world's fastest-growing human populations. Animals and humans come into increasing contact and the results can be catastrophic. In this three part series we meet the scientists and researchers who are dedicating their lives to ensuring that Sri Lanka's most extraordinary wildlife – elephants, monkeys and sloth bears – can share this tiny island with people in peace. ",
