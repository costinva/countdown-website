  "overview": "An epic family saga set in the Russian Urals before, during and after the Second World War. The story is centered on the Morozov family - Aleksey, Stepan, Aliona and Varvara - two brothers and two sisters, with a multitude of complex relationships between them. Miraculously, they all survive the slaughter of World War II, but not without learning some important lessons on the way, including the meaning of true love, that overcomes all hurdles and heals all wounds, and how to cope with grief, leading them ultimately to a long dreamed-of happiness.",
