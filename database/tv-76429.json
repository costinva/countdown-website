  "overview": "Join James St. James and co-hosts Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato as they talk to the leading New York nightlife figures of the 1970s, '80s, '90s, and beyond. Featured guests include Dianne Brill, Michael Musto, Peter Gatien, Lisa Edelstein, Moby, and Joey Arias among others. It's campy, it's gossipy, it's jaw-droppingly funny...definitely must-hear podcasting.",
