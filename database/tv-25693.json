  "overview": "Hassel is a realistic, finely nuanced and unvarnished thriller series based freely on the iconic detective Roland Hassel, who is the main character in 29 books by Olov Svedelid. Just as in Svedelid's original vision the series reflects contemporary issues in an increasingly tough social climate. The tone is hard-boiled and direct. We descend to the dark stuff, down in the gutter, where it's dirty, and out to the suburbs. We're forced to put on the gloves and delve into the corruption, the filth and stink spreading high up the social strata. It's uncompromising and in sharp contrast to the safe, harmonious everyday existence we all long for in the relaxed facade of family life.",
