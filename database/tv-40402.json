Angel's Last Mission: Love stars an angel named Dan, a mischievous troublemaker who fell to the human world after meddling in human affairs, and a human named Lee Yun Seo, a cold-hearted ballerina who does not believe in love. Angels who break the law and meddle in human affairs get condemned to earth and as punishment must make a human find true love! However, the ballerina that Dan has been assigned to isn't even close to believing in love. Will our angel be able to fulfill his mission and return to the heavens?",
