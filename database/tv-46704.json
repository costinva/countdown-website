  "overview": "In our modern media landscape where real courtroom dramas have increasingly been transformed into a form of entertainment, Trial By Media reflects on some of the most dramatic and memorable trials in recent history. Since televised coverage introduced a new emphasis on creative storytelling and showmanship into the legal system, the courtroom has never been the same. Trial by Media explores the many ways in which the press have contributed to reshaping public perception about guilt or innocence before, during or after a trial. The series features cases reaching across different areas of the law including the unforgettable Jenny Jones made-for-Court TV murder trials, the sensational story of Rod Blagojevich's political fall, and the case of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who was shot 41 times by police in New York City.",
