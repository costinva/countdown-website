  "overview": "At all costs, Feel Good Inc. (FGI) tells us that it can outsource its own happiness. The company promises to eliminate people's problems and make every customer happy, whatever they are - paying for what they paid for. Bribery, extortion, spitting, threatening, cheating - everything is allowed. And when the service is put on the soft pack of lifecoaching, then there is no need for even a bad conscience.",
