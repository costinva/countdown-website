  "overview": "Join the Demolition Man Lawrie and his crew of misfits, as they crash and bash everything from heritage properties to industrial warehouses for cash. Don't be fooled, Lawrie's not just a demolition man; he's also a treasure hunter. He salvages stuff that would otherwise end up at the tip, finding rare items which he's accumulated into one of the world's best collections, worth millions. From vintage cars to buckets of old roofing screws, Lawrie has found it all. What he finds he drags back to his shop to sell, and he knows how to sell it for a quid.",
