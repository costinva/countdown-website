  "overview": "After retiring from gymnastics, Han Jiwon thought his biggest challenges were behind him. Turns out, winning Olympic medals was easy compared to surviving university as a painfully shy ex-superstar. Enter Kwon Jungwooâ€”campus heartthrob, basketball star, and a whole new world of trouble wrapped up in a perfect smile. But just when Jiwon thinks he has Jungwoo figured out, he discovers a surprisingly sweet side beneath that cold exterior. Can this unlikely duo overcome their differences and stick the landing on their budding romance?",
