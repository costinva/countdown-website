  "overview": "A deep dive into the Bosnian War, that tore the country apart at the dawn of the 1990s, A Life's Worth explores with intensity the unimaginable dilemma faced by the peacekeepers sent to the region, unable to intervene in a conflict that was beyond their control. A gripping series and a much-needed look back at one of the most violent wars in recent European history, prompting an essential discussion about the weight of commitment, interventionism, and the cost of peace.",
