  "overview": "Carlos Gianola is an employee at a major financial company. His specialty is evaluating and detecting opportunities in the market. However, his enormous talent and expertise in the field are usually not recognized. His boss is capable of depriving him of a well-deserved promotion to promote people of his own kidney, who do not possess the least technical training. This situation is extremely tiring.One day he meets Patricia Arriola, an intriguing woman with whom he becomes intimate. She makes him a proposal that, apparently, seems innocent: to make a pact to get rid of each other from the people they hate. In Carlos's case, the first on the list is clearly his superior.The next morning, back to his routine, Carlos learns that his boss has been killed. A cold sweat runs down his body: Did your wish come true? After the fateful event, he does not hear from Patricia again ... until three years later.That woman reappears now demanding \"his part of the deal\": it is Carlos's turn to do something for him. It must ruin the life of María Cortés, a person with whom Patricia is more than at odds. Victim of blackmail, the financial analyst is used to execute revenge: Will he be able to carry out this sinister plan?",
