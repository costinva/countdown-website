  "overview": "If we know the venerable philosopher, a refugee in Ferney, we know the Young Voltaire less. A commoner by birth, the future Voltaire will shake up all the social and religious conventions of his time. Embastellated twice, exiled in England, historiographer of Louis XV, hated by the Court of France, millionaire at 40 thanks to speculation. Voltaire wants everything: glory, women and money!",
