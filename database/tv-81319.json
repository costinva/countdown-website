  "overview": "In the down-home medical series, Jack Albertson played an elderly country doctor in Dixon Mills, USA, who was training his young successor, Simon Locke. The first season was televised by some Canadian stations, despite not being aired across the entire CTV network. As Simon Locke transitioned from a rural physician to a major city police surgeon, the show's title was changed to Police Surgeon after the first season.  ",
