  "overview": "Jun, a mischievous high school boy known for being an expert in pushing people's buttons, and Sorn, a composed, orderly man who absolutely cannot stand kids like him, have been at odds since the day they met. From sneaking salt into toothpaste to hiding personal belongings, Jun's endless pranks have made Sorn loathe him to the core. But fate has a sense of humor. When Jun unexpectedly runs into Sorn in an unusual situation, what starts as awkwardness soon becomes the beginning of a complicated connection. The man who once firmly declared, \"I don't like kids\", finds himself slowly stirred by unfamiliar emotions. From conflict to closeness, the line between annoyance and affection begins to blur.",
