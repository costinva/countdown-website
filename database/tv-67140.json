  "overview": "In the years since the Allied victory, historians have chronicled both the heroism and plight of ground troops, navy and airmen, their wins, their losses, their sacrifices, and the slow movement of the righteous towards victory. These stories defined the greatest generation, but it's not the whole story. From conspiracies to covert ops, some pieces of the narrative seem to have slipped through the cracks of our collective memory. Now, we journey to fill in the gaps between those well-known, well-documented events as we shed light on the war efforts you've never even heard of to reveal the truth behind WWI's forgotten frontlines.",
