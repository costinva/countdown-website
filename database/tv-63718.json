  "overview": "\"Sai Roong\" speaks of memories and the steadfast love of a young woman named Maythinee for a man whose name she calls out whenever she dares to feel, for her lover, Pak, who died in a car accident after her mother forced her to write him a breakup letter. Her lover is gone and the memories of the past, no matter how beautiful, can not come back. All Maythinee can do is drown herself in alcohol and try to forget. And perhaps also endure the heartbreak of suddenly seeing her dead lover's face in another man. However, it is unknown to her that the man with her dead lover's face is indeed her dead lover, Pak, who is still alive and living under a new name, Ponsithon. While Pak had loved her, Ponsithon is still burning in the flames of betrayal until his only desire is to get revenge.Â ",
