  "overview": "Orlando Soria, is inviting two of his best friends--design assistant, Kara Thomas, and carpenter, Justin Swaby--to watch iconic redesigns and renovations from HGTV's past. Throughout each episode, the trio will vote on whether the trends seen within each clip are part of the future of design, or if they should be put away for good. In the end, they'll vote on which trend was their ultimate favorite. From granite countertops in kitchens to free-standing tubs in bathrooms, you'll have to watch each episode to find out which trends make the cut (orâ€¦ don't). This is Fad or the Future.",
