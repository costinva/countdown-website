  "overview": "District Z is a brand new, hugely ambitious family challenge-adventure gameshow set in an apocalyptic world filled with zombies which takes place in a set as big as 14 football fields. In each episode, five celebrities undertake a series of impressive challenges. When night falls, the doors of District Z open and the game begins: before the sun rises, the candidates must overcome numerous physical and mental challenges while facing creatures controlled by the mysterious Professor Z, in order to reach treasure kept in a secret vault. However, the stakes are high: if the candidates don't finish the game in time, the doors will close on them forever.",
