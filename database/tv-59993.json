  "overview": "In order to make maximum profits, husband and wife team, Krystal and Dedric Polite use their 50/50 Flip Strategy to renovate a home with less than $50K in under 50 days. These real estate investors have flipped the flipping business in Burlington, North Carolina as they transform homes in the area Krystal and her family grew up in and currently reside. To them it's about creating affordable housing for everyone and not allowing a big developer to come in and outprice their hometown. Family is everything and by investing back in the community they also want to create generational wealth that they can build and leave to their two young boys and their kids' kids.",
