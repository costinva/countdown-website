  "overview": "A spin-off of \"Vecinos\", this series proves that money does not change people, it reveals them, When the López Pérez family receives the news that their uncle Fidel, the cacique of Angangueo, passed away and left them his fortune, their lives take a dramatic turn. Now living in an a luxurious mansion in Las Lomas that they inherited, the López Pérez have everything they always dreamed of--wealth, indulgence, and plenty of chaos.  Think of them as a Mexican version of the Kardashians. But as they soon discover, money doesn't hide the naco—it just makes it shine. What won't Doña Magda, Don Arturo, Alejandra, Rocko and Morris do with millions of pesos? ",
