  "overview": "Lost Resort follows a group of strangers who are immersed in a three-week-long Costa Rican retreat led by a colorful team of alternative healers. From a married couple on the brink, to a mother/daughter pair with serious trust issues and a hothead with a painful past, the guests come from all walks of life hoping to leave transformed. At their breaking points and fed up with traditional Western therapies, they'll experience everything from rage rituals and shamanic cacao ceremonies to orgasmic dance. But the drama only intensifies between sessions as this motley crew hooks up, breaks up and opens up in ways they'd never expect.",
