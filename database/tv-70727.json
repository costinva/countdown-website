  "overview": "On March 20, 2013, a private jet was spectacularly boarded by Dominican stups at Punta Cana airport. On board: 26 suitcases filled with 700 kilos of cocaine, two former Navy fighter pilots, a business bringer and a disturbing passenger. This is the beginning of an incredible soap opera, marked by river trials on both sides of the Atlantic, opposing versions, an amazing escape, and a surprising gallery of characters. ",
