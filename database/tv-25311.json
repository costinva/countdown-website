  "overview": "The new six-part documentary series about mother-daughter relationships. It gives a glimpse into the lives and dilemmas of adolescent girls and the way their mothers handle it. Mothers and daughters in different age groups have filmed another three months. The series is produced by Wefilm and directed by Anne-Marieke Graafmans. \"The protagonists themselves do the camera work,\" says Marnix Laurs, Director of Content at KPN. \"That makes the series unique. I'm incredibly proud of the beautiful end result.\" Dochters (Daughters) is an innovative way to bring mother-daughter relationships in picture. This approach was chosen because no one comes closer to family life than themselves, \"said Bas Welling, co-founder of Wefilm.",
