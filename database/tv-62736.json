  "overview": "Even luck would not pass by without getting lost in Tozluyaka, but it plunged headlong into those who chose each other as brothers… This time, the journey of hope began… It made them touch every street they passed, every person they named, those who were hungry for cruelty, injustice, love… This was everyone's story. They were just the lucky ones among us.",
