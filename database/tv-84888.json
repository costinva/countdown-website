  "overview": "An elite brothel for VIPs. Here, hot caresses are sold and serious passions boil. A well-oiled criminal mechanism has failed: one of the new girls is killed. In order not to jeopardize her well-being, the middle-aged manager of the brothel decides to cover up the matter as quickly as possible. To do this, she calls the head of security - a cynical, ruthless thug nicknamed Cain - and orders him to eliminate the girl's mother... The cruel laws of the big city, the delights of criminal love, the weaknesses of the powerful. What is life \"on the other side\" of morality - and what is it, the code of dishonor?",
