  "overview": "Over the many billions of years of the Earth's history our planet has never stopped changing shape. Massive tectonic forces have sculpted and resculpted our world in a never ending journey. Tectonics has created life - and destroyed it as well. Huge volcanoes and devastating earthquakes continue to dominate human history. This is a story of high drama and intense beauty; the interaction of geology and life.",
