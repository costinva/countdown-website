  "overview": "'The Godfather of Fentanyl' tells the story of the first widespread fentanyl overdose epidemic in US history, featuring exclusive interviews with George Erik Marquardt. A self-taught savant, Marquardt teams up with the Boston mob to introduce fentanyl in the early 90's. His product quickly finds its way to cities all over the Northeast and results in a national priority investigation by the DEA. Told by Marquardt and law enforcement officials who chased him, this is a never-before-heard story.",
