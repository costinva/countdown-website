  "overview": "Four celebrity friends take a girls trip to Vietnam to reinvigorate themselves, find new inspiration and celebrate a birthday. Nivea, Eva Marcille, Tammy Rivera and London Hughes travel through three regions of Vietnam, experiencing the culture and learning about one another. Along the way, cultural clashes and misunderstandings within the group lead to trouble early in the trip, and the ladies must figure out if they can get things back on track. The spirituality, hospitality and beauty of Vietnam help the ladies heal from heartache, strengthen friendships and reevaluate their priorities back at home.",
