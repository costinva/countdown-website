  "overview": "Digorians, Nganasans, Evens, Koryaks, Izhora ... Among the small peoples of Russia there are those who have not assimilated among their numerous neighbors and have not lost their originality. Their number sometimes does not exceed several thousand, and sometimes hundreds of people. Their life over the past thousand years has not changed. They have preserved ancient beliefs, traditions, and language. The TV channel \"My Planet\" begins to write its Red Book of the peoples of Russia, whose culture may disappear tomorrow.",
