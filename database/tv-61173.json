  "overview": "Marry Me Now gives women the chance to take charge of their own fate. Each week we follow one determined woman, who has had enough of waiting for a ring. She will take the lead in her life and relationship, and prepare her own wedding in just a few days and all without the groom-to-be's knowledge. On the 3rd day she will surprise her partner in her wedding dress with an ambush proposal! If he says no, it's all over,Â but if he says yes, they will tie the knot on the spot.",
