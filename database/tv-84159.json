  "overview": "Sitting Bull offers an overarching exploration of the remarkable life and accomplishments of the fiercely brave yet humble Lakota chief. In the mid-19th century, as American settlers continued their westward expansion, they began encroaching upon Native territories. Amid this turmoil, a legendary Lakota leader rose to defend his people, their culture, and their way of life. Unyielding in his resolve, he united Native Nations in an extraordinary alliance, lead them in the historic Battle of Little Bighorn against US Army General George Armstrong Custer, gained worldwide fame with Buffalo Bill Cody, and courageously fought against seemingly impossible odds. Told through expert interviews, dramatic yet authentic scripted sequences, and supplemented by rich archival material, \"Sitting Bull'' details the seminal moments and key figures in Native American history including the Washita Massacre, renowned warrior Crazy Horse, the Battle of Cedar Creek and the Wounded Knee Massacre.",
