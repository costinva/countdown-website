  "overview": "After its nationwide search to find the country's most devoted Royal fans, BBC America today unveils the five finalists who will join Cat Deeley on a whistle-stop tour of Royal London, as part of its original program, Royally Mad.\"From an air steward to a wedding planner, the finalists come from all over the U.S. and include two life-long friends who live on opposite sides of the country and haven't seen one another in 10 years. The one thing they ALL have in common â€“ they ADORE the Royal Family. BBC America's Royally Mad will give them the chance of a lifetime: to visit some of the places associated with the Royal Family and the Royal Wedding and meet some of the people who know Kate and William and who are involved in the upcoming nuptials.",
