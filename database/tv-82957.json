  "overview": "In Katrina: Come Hell and High Water, the people of New Orleans share their stories in their own words â€” from what it was like to survive the hurricane to how the city and their lives have been forever changed as a result. Brimming with emotion, the series serves as a testament to the resilience of New Orleanians and a stark call for vigilance and preparation as cataclysmic natural disasters continue to become more and more commonplace all over the world.",
