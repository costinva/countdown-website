  "overview": "Three Christmases. Three Women. Three Generations. The grandmother Vivi, the daughter Sonja, the granddaughter Lara. It is a story about three very different women who face challenges in love and life and struggle with choices about freedom and sacrifice over the span of almost a hundred years. And it is a story about the spirit, the invisible essence, that lives on over time within these women. Is there something that gets passed on over generations within them? Can you ever really be free from what happened before you?",
