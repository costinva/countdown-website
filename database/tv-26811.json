  "overview": "70 children aged between six and 11 across the UK tell us what they really think of the world, with insightful, funny and moving results. Equipped with cameras at home, they film their own lives through major events, while their after school clubs are rigged with cameras and a number of tasks devised by philosophers shake through the big issues of the day offering an intimate insight into how children think.",
