  "overview": "The series is set at the Camp Runamuck Summer recreational retreat for boys, and the Camp Divine retreat for girls. Camp Runamuck is slipshodly operated by Commander Wivenhoe, a child hater, and his staff of lamebrains: Spiffy, Pruett, Malden, and Doc. Camp Divine, on the other hand, is impeccably maintained under the auspices of Counselor Mahala May Gruenecker and her beautiful assistant Caprice Yeudleman.&lt;P&gt;Stories relate Wivenhoe's attempts to cope with his horde of brats, and his efforts to stop the female counselors from conning his men into performing burdensome tasks for Camp Divine.",
