  "overview": "The 4-part documentary event Secrets of the Chippendales Murders gives a look beyond the bright lights into a dark world of drugs, arson, a love triangle and a murder.Chippendales was a nightclub that aimed to allure and please women with its scantily clad male dancers and vivacious music, and quickly advanced toward a pop culture phenomenon, until it came crashing down. Through exclusive interviews, never-before-seen crime scene video and declassified FBI surveillance audio, the limited series unravels the hidden tale of how sex, jealousy, arson, hefty-bags filled with cash and mafia shakedowns all led up to one of the most outrageous murders in American history.",
