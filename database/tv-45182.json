  "overview": "In each one-hour episode of America's Top Dog, four police K9 teams, including fan-favorites from the hit series \"Live PD,\" and one civilian team will face off for the title of \"Top Dog\" in three rounds of high velocity, furry competition. The skilled teams will be tested on their speed, agility, scenting ability, and teamwork by completing a series of expert tasks on one of the biggest and toughest K9 obstacle courses ever assembled - designed by experts to mimic real-life challenges that these furry heroes face every day on the beat. Teams will navigate a complex maze to locate scented items and apprehend a suspect in a bite suit with a takedown, among a variety of other challenges. Each week's winning team will receive $10,000 and an additional $5,000 to donate to the animal charity of their choice. In the final week of competition, top competitors will return to the finale course to battle for the title of \"America's Top Dog\" and an additional $25,000 cash prize.",
