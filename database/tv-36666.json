  "overview": "Looking for Alaska thrusts us into the perspective of Miles \"Pudge\" Halter who is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave \"the Great Perhaps\" even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . . After. Nothing is ever the same.",
