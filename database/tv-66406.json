  "overview": "Village \"Prestige\" - a place for the elite. Officials, top managers, opera divas with their families and servants live here. The usual existence of the village is interrupted by the murder of the nanny of the Filimonov family. This makes the neighbors look at each other with suspicion and wonder if those to whom they trust the most precious thing - their children are so perfect. In the course of the investigation, which begins the \"queen of the local police\" Elizaveta Yegorovna, it becomes clear that absolutely every inhabitant of the \"Prestige\" has his own secrets and motives for the murder.",
