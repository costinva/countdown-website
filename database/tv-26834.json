  "overview": "Police detective Lin Tao is probably the only friend medical examiner Qin Ming has because Lin is the only one who can tolerate his eccentricity. When yet another assistant quit on Qin, Li Da Bao is sent as a replacement. Qin initially questions her ability to handle the gruesome tasks of forensic work, but she proves to be both resilient and observant. They became a solid trio that solve murders by piecing together clues from the dead.",
