  "overview": "The Imawano family moves into a new house which has a reputation for being haunted. On the very day they move in the grandfather, Fuchio, dies leaving behind his wife, his daughter, her husband and their two kids. That night the grandson Kiyoshi (played by Takahashi Issei) is sent a note from Fuchio telling him to meet him in the room behind The Room Which Will Not Open at 2 AM. When he does, he discovers his grandfather's spirit waiting for him, and finds out that his family is psychic, allowing them to sense spirits and apparitions. They will be faced with a great catastrophe in the near future and Kiyoshi, Fuchio says, is the only one who can stop it. This series is hilarious, a little bit creepy (though very cheap and silly), has a wonderful cast, and is overall one of the funnest things I have watched in awhile! It's like the Addams Family, but without the goth mystique and with an eccentricity that can only be found in a Japanese sitcom.Â ",
