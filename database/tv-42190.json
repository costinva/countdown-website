  "overview": "Florida has a snake problem – and snake hunter Dusty Crum has assembled the team to tackle it. The Everglades, considered the largest subtropical wilderness in the US, is a wetland paradise in the southern tip of Florida that is home to hundreds of unique species of wildlife. Once brimming with an abundance of life, today this swampy utopia and the native wildlife who call it home, is in grave danger. There is a new predator in town – the Burmese Python — which has already decimated more than 90 percent of certain mammal and bird species in parts of the Everglades. Now, one man has made it his life's calling – and business – to save the Glades from these foreign predators and total destruction.",
