  "overview": "Sandrine Laplace, a bumbling contract worker, thinks she's a CIA agent, and decides to investigate a mysterious accident at the local fairground. Incompetent and intolerant to glucose, she will have to infiltrate this very closed world rich in cotton candy. Between clan wars, fluff and bumper cars, she will be forced to team up with Yvanne and Carmen, two fairgrounds without faith or law. What if there was a killer in the carnival?",
