  "overview": "Chi is a self-confessed ‘stay-at-home-daughter'. She lives a simple life; she eats crisps, makes weird vlogs and watches sitcoms, and that's all she's done for 20 years to be fair. But when her parents, who she is so dependent on, unexpectedly die, Chi is suddenly forced to fend for herself. Chi will inherit the house on condition she completes a list of 'Things You Should Have Done' left by her parents (everything from ‘Pet a dog' to ‘Get a job'). Meanwhile Chi's highly strung Auntie Karen wants nothing to do with her dependent pest of a niece, but very much wants the house she feels is rightfully hers! In each episode, Chi tackles something from the list and is unleashed on the locals of Ramsgate, who bring something new to Chi's understanding of life but leave wishing they'd never met her.",
