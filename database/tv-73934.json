  "overview": "Be transported to the early American West! In 1822, Jim Bridger embarked on history-making escapades as a mountain man, explorer, trapper, and Cavalry Scout. Join Bridger on his later travels as a Bozeman Trail guide to settlers, soldiers, speculators, and other colorful characters, many who had no idea of the dangerous challenges they would face. Bridger shares his wisdom through incredible, heart-racing tales of his death-defying adventures on the Western Frontier. Every week brings a new group of travelers and another of Bridger's heroic stories of justice, pivotal life-changing choices, daring escapes, fights waged against all odds, and much more. Just how tall are these tall tales? Mere exaggeration or the whole truth? You be the judge!",
