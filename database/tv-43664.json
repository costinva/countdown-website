  "overview": "Dog: Impossible invites viewers on an inspiring, uplifting journey with dog behavior specialist Matt Beisner, who has dedicated his life to working with some of the most dangerous, most aggressive and most misunderstood dogs in the country. These are dogs everyone else has given up on - even other trainers. In many cases, they are in danger of being put down. But, while everyone else may think there is no hope for these dogs, Beisner is making a difference in the lives of dogs and their owners around the country.",
