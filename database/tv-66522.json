  "overview": "Follow the flow of water across the Australian continent to uncover the incredible connections that link all creatures on earth: from ants, to eagles to us. Over three dynamic episodes, this series sets out on a journey across the driest inhabited continent on earth - following the rain, rivers and underground aquifers as they transform and connect distant ecosystems. Each stop on the journey reveals a new piece of the ecological puzzle that connects organisms and ecosystems, creating a planet just right for us. An epic adventure across Australia's unique landscapes, and a love letter to the only planet we know that sustains life.",
