  "overview": "Segunda Chamada focuses on the resilience stories of teachers and students in a complex public education system. After some time off from teaching, LÃºcia Helena returns to the classroom, now giving night classes to teenagers and adults. Along with other three teachers and the principal, she faces institutional adversities and the lack of appreciation without flinching. The conflicts involve both the faculty and the student body and, in this scenario, Education emerges as a hope, reminding everyone that it is never too late to have a second chance.",
