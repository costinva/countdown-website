  "overview": "Summer has arrived, and Giada De Laurentiis and her daughter, Jade, are spending it on the California coast at a vacation home with a stunning beachfront view. The charming area has a true vacation vibe, but it's also close enough to Los Angeles that Giada's family and friends can visit on the weekends. Each weekend, Giada, Jade and their guests spend time cooking together in the kitchen and around the grill, sharing stories, laughs and, of course, casual and delicious meals outside.",
