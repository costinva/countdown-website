  "overview": "Have you ever played a video game and thought, \"Hey, games are pretty cool. Except when they're all broken and glitchy. I wish I knew if other people felt the same way.\" It's a desolate world out there, but GREAT NEWS! You're not alone after all. Join Gus, Ashley, Ryan, and friends from the Rooster Teeth crew to discuss the latest games, talk through issues that impact the gaming industry, digest the latest news, respond to your carefully crafted emails, search for more synonyms to make \"talk\" sound exciting, and occasionally pretend to be professional about the whole thing (and fail with style).",
