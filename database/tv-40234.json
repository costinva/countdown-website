  "overview": "In the heart of the suburbs of the city of Bonta, in the neighbourhood \nwhere taverns and small craft shops of all kinds flourish, is Kerub \nCrispin's bazaar. It is in this antique shop that the old Ecaflip raises\n Joris, his young adopted son. The shop is a veritable cavern of \nwonders, where the child can find a thousand and one \"treasures\": \nweapons, amulets, artefacts; some ornamental, some precious and even \nsome that are magic. Original, beautiful and enigmatic, each object \ngrabs the attention of the curious young boy: \"What is this object, \nKerub? What is it? How did it get here?\" His father takes great pleasure\n in answering each question with a story: A flashback takes us back to \nthe days when Kerub was still a feisty young Ecaflip, twenty years old \nand travelling the World of Twelve in search of adventure.",
