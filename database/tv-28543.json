  "overview": "Costa is a man of the people. A man who can connect with all. His infectious character and passion for his subject puts people at ease and makes them shine. A Landscape Architect with an all-consuming passion for plants and people - Costa knows how to find the best in both of them, and takes great pleasure in bringing them together. Costa's Garden Odyssey is a groundbreaking magazine style series that allows this unique Greek Garden Guru an opportunity to do what he does best - spread his green wisdom while communicating with people and celebrating cultures and community in a way never seen before on Australian television. Costa's Garden Odyssey shows us how to tread lightly - embracing nature's cycles and seasons, investigating and championing our local produce from it's source, and illustrating that in gardens, plants aren't the only things that grow... people do to.",
