  "overview": "In a time where dictatorships were commonplace, Argentina hosted the most significant sport event on the planet. As thousands of people were abducted and taken to concentration camps, the military saw the World Cup as an opportunity to legitimize their power. Meanwhile, millions of Argentine fans followed the matches, seeking a glimmer of light between the dark. Across four episodes, this documentary weaves together soccer, horror, and political intrigue to tell a story that is both unique and unforgettable.Â ",
