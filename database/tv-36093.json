  "overview": "Anthony Stewart Head explores the truth behind the long established Hollywood Myths of Vampires, Demons, Werewolves, Witches and Zombies and discovers that behind the stories we've all seen on the Silver Screen lie even more disturbing origins. Unlike other documentaries where the presenter is based in the studio providing quirky links between films of reporters in the field, Anthony was hands on throughout the production. He met and interviewed experts as varied as the Head of the Vatican's Exorcism Department and Chief Druids and travelled to such far afield places as the Caparthian Mountains, Zululand and France.",
