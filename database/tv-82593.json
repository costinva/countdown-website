  "overview": "Jewelry designer Xie Qing Han was trapped by Qiao Yi Zhou's false \"favor\" trap. She constantly compromised for love, stayed away from society, and lost herself, becoming a \"gunman\" used by her boyfriend Qiao Yi Zhou. But after meeting Shao Qing Yun, Xie Qing Han gradually realized that her cognition had always been narrow and wrong. Normal feelings should be mutual understanding and mutual achievement, rather than gaining pleasure and achievements by oppressing each other. Under Shao Qing Yun's strong intervention, Xie Qing Han kept growing. She re-engaged with society, resumed work, and restarted her beloved career.  ",
