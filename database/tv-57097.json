  "overview": "The tasks are many and varied: Who can build a bridge that can withstand half a ton of weights? Who builds the tallest tower, the nicest apartment or the fastest car? The answer will probably surpass anything you previously thought was possible when it comes to LEGO. There will be passion, high-level sports, strong emotions and magic - and an eternal battle to surpass oneself and the competitors. Only one team remains the winner of 500,000 kroner.",
