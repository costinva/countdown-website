  "overview": "The Sister is a chilling and suspenseful story of murder – and perhaps ghosts – which exposes the quiet terror of a man trying to escape his past. It follows well-meaning but directionless Nathan, who has a terrible secret he's long prayed would stay buried and for which he's long worked hard to make recompense. Almost a decade into his new and devoted married life, Nathan is rocked to the core when Bob, an unwelcome face from the past, turns up on his doorstep with shocking news….triggering a series of catastrophic decisions which cleverly drive a tense and compelling narrative of psychological suspense, dread, love and possible redemption.",
