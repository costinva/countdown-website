  "overview": "Alongside the global women's sports movement in 2019 came W Series, a new motor racing series for female drivers with the ambition to rethink racing and change the face of motorsport. Witness the passion and effort required to succeed against the odds in this six-part documentary series available now on All 4. Denied a realistic chance to reach the pinnacle of their sport, a group of the world's finest female racing drivers are whittled down to a group of 18 to compete in a brand new, free-to-enter racing series which aims to produce the first female Formula 1 driver since 1976. W Series: Driven highlights the bravery and tenacity of these drivers on and off the track, as they push the limits in the pursuit of acceptance in an industry that has not produced a female F1 Grand Prix driver for almost half a century.",
