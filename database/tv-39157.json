  "overview": "It is summer and a group of children from 10 to 14 years old will be at their first holiday colony - far away from the mainland on a deserted island. Albert, Viktoria, Carl, Milo and Niklas are looking forward to get away and have a break from everyday life, school and parents. They do not know each other and are apparently very different, but everything is good. A lightning glow on the ferry, however, alerts that something is under sailing and shortly after arriving at the island, they lose contact with the mainland. Now it's up to the kids, they are alone, and things are not what they look like. There is something wrong on the island, and the children must learn for the first time to manage themselves.",
