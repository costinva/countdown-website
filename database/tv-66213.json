  "overview": "Based on real facts, Abandonados recalls the unprecedented alliance between the Portuguese, Timorese and Australians uniting against a common enemy that did not hesitate to commit the greatest atrocities against the local populations and against all those who opposed him. The series narrates the dramatic situation in which many of these men and women were left, forgotten and abandoned in Timor, and the persistent struggle of a soldier - Lieutenant Pires, who, against all obstacles and difficulties, created by the Salazar government itself, did everything to save his companions, until his final sacrifice. This series shows us the tortuous paths of politics and the interests of states overcoming individual interests, with all the injustice and inhumanity that this often entails, giving Abandonados a universal meaning.",
