  "overview": "Podcaster and journalist Gabriel Gatehouse sets out to solve the biggest mystery in tech: who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin? But Gabriel realises in fact he's on a much bigger story. Is Bitcoin part of a conspiracy to end democracy and transform the world? Gabriel's journey takes in cryogenic freezing, old hackers on Caribbean islands, gun-toting libertarians who want to break free from the rest of the US, and gene editing in a private city state. This is a world of futuristic ideas that were once the preserve of geeks and misfits but, with Trump and Musk now in the White House, are increasingly mainstream. Bitcoin emerged in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, invented by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Three years later, Satoshi disappeared.Â ",
