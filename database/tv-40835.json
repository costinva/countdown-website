  "overview": "Some parents love them, others loathe them, but playdates are a part of modern family life and speak volumes about who we are, where we live, how we parent and how we differ from each other. Families with children from the same neighborhood but across cultural, ethnic and economic divides meet for a playdate for the first time.",
