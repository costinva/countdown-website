  "overview": "The series tells the story of eight students who have arrived for studies at Kota's two biggest, rival coaching institutes â€“ the Ratanraj Jindal and Arvind Batra-led centres. These are the owners of the top institutes hell-bent on finishing the other to gain complete control of the education business in Kota. Their no-holds-barred rivalry is akin to a chess game. The pawns in this game, are the students and the teachers. Their student life is full of fun and camaraderie in the beginning but slowly the pressures and the competition intensifies. As the two drastically different worlds of the students and the coaching institute owners collide, there is pandemonium. The stakes are raised, motives clash and lives are put at risk.",
