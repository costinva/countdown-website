  "overview": "As a pediatrician working at the Taoyuan Village Clinic, Ye Shi Lan has nothing but the best interest of her patients at heart. Wanting only the best for the children she treats, Shi Lan should have been happy when the new hospital director, Lu Zhao Xi, was appointed. But a rather large misunderstanding on her part means she and the new director start their working relationship off on the very wrong foot. Believing Zhao Xi is an unscrupulous drug dealer who has no qualms about defrauding people, Shi Lan does everything she can to make the new hospital director's life miserable. But after she's appointed to the position of his temporary assistant, it doesn't take long for her to realize she was terribly mistaken about Zhao Xi. Working closely together to solve a number of problems, Shi Lan and Zhao Xi are eventually able to put the past behind them and begin to develop a mutual understanding and respect for each other. Working side-by-side to save lives, Zhao Xi and Shi Lan gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a doctor. Inspiring each other to become the best they can be, this unlikely pair begin to fall in love but are either of them ready to admit the feelings they've secretly been harboring?Â ",
