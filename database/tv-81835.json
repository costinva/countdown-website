  "overview": "When Justine Blanchet, mother of 16-year-old Capucine and Pierre-Marie, discovers that her husband, Rémi, has been unemployed for six months and that they are on the verge of bankruptcy, her \"perfect\" world collapses. Unable to cope with this downgrade, Justine will drag Rémi to the dark side of the force to save face. Lacking a plan B, they will implement a plan C. C for burglary. But it's not so easy to improvise as a burglar when you don't have the codes or the network, when the vigilant neighbors are keeping an eye on things, and when the police are zealously investigating... Drawing unexpected fulfillment from this incredible and dangerous double life, the Blanchets will realize the absurdity of their previous life and will gradually find the path to happiness.",
