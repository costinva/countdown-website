  "overview": "Gene, a writer by profession, is one day given a request by his publisher to try his hand at a new type of genre, which is Boys Love. Accepting this new challenge, Gene writes and publishes a Y novel that is well received and becomes incredibly successful. So successful that it even gets made into a BL drama. This is the story of how Gene, a popular writer, gets deceived by the 20-year-old guy, Nubsib, who comes to audition for the lead roleâ€”pretending to be polite and good-natured when he is a wolf in reality.",
