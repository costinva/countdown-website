  "overview": "Doctor's Orders wanders into the wild world of motorcycle gangs to explore the sordid truth behind a woman's planned murder, orchestrated by a husband who believed he was too powerful to get caught. With unique animation in place of recreation, informant Andrew Glick takes viewers through the fatally twisted tale of greed, murder, and municipal corruption. Set against the backdrop of America's opioid epidemic, DOCTOR'S ORDERS exposes the underbelly of crime with a well-respected doctor at the forefront.",
