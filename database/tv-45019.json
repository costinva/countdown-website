  "overview": "Fueling both his fascination and his fear of the paranormal while simultaneously tapping into social media to explore every angle of his search, Adam Ellis and friends Jen Lewis (researcher/documentarian) and Paul Bradford (ghost hunter and lead investigator) are on a mission to help others understand and escape their own nightmares. The trio will travel America — from Oregon to Massachusetts — hoping to help people take back their lives after unexplainable encounters with the paranormal. By assisting others, Ellis hopes what he learns from his hands-on investigations will help further a deeper understanding of his own haunting.",
