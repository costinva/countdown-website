  "overview": "Human Discoveries features a group of friends living at the dawn of human civilization. Of course, they're the first to discover necessities like fire and the wheel. But, much more importantly, we'll watch as they stumble onto humanity's best, and worst, developments, including art, alcohol, fashion, racism, small talk and, much to their confusion, monogamy.",
