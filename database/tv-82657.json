A year later, Frank's boss, the wealthy and charming Andrew, pursued him, leading to an affair. The once-playboy Andrew learned commitment and restraint, while Frank, once betrayed, regained trust and learned to love freely. At the divorce site, Frank discovered his husband and boss were the same person.",
