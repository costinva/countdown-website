  "overview": "The Listeners centres around Claire, a popular English teacher, who begins to hear a low humming sound that no one else around her can hear.This seemingly innocuous noise gradually upsets the balance of her life, increasing tension between herself and her husband, Paul, and daughter, Ashley. But despite multiple doctors, no obvious source or medical cause can be found. But when she discovers that a student of hers, Kyle, can also hear the sound, the two strike up an unlikely and intimate friendship. Finding themselves increasingly isolated from their families, friends and colleagues, they fall in with a disparate group of neighbours, led by a charismatic couple, Jo and Omar, who also claim they can hear The Hum â€“ and who believe it could be a gift, heard only by a \"chosen few.\"",
