  "overview": "A small southern town on the sea. Cozy cafes on the embankment, homemade wine on tap, paid fishing on boats. The city also has its own iconic figures: Gleb Valentinovich, a semi-legal businessman, owner of restaurants and kiosks, and Sergei Voronets, head of the police department, who has a percentage for a quiet life from the same establishments. The town lives a lazy and pleasant life until a few strange deaths occur - yesterday, still healthy people die in a couple of hours. An epidemiologist from the capital is called to the city. Gleb and the team are trying to intercept and bribe him: it is not at all in their interests to close the season. But Evgeny Levin turns out to be fundamental. However, with his dedication and willingness to get into any fight, he will soon make Gleb respect himself. Gleb does not know one thing: Zhenya is the same man, because of a break with whom his young wife once left Moscow.",
