  "overview": "Amsterdam, a city with ten thousand different species. We are very familiar with some, while others we may not be. The animals are very diverse, but do have one thing in common; they literally live next, below or above us. Not everyone is happy with them, especially not when they are eating your harvest or when they soil your grandmother's grave. But there are plenty of citizens which will do everything in their power to lure them into the city. Stadsmormels will show you how life is connected between humans and animals.",
