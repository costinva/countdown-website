  "overview": "Die schlechtesten Filme aller Zeiten - aka \"Schlefaz\" (eng. \"The Worst Movies Of All Time\") is a satirical film series available at German private broadcaster Tele 5. Since 2013 Oliver Kalkofe and Peter Rütten have gifted us with introducing, commenting and presenting particularily badly crafted or unintentionally funny B-movies in the tradition of Mystery Science Theater 3000. So far the iconic duo have made us laugh for 148 episodes. ",
