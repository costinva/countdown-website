  "overview": "The competitors, all Julia Child superfans, share personal stories about their hero, cook in a kitchen recreated in the likeness of where Julia herself cooked, using the same ingredients Julia used and are even guided by Julia herself, through a larger-than-life television screen right in the middle of all the action. Head judgeAntonia Lofaso and a rotating panel of guest judges including Molly Baz, Cliff Crooks and Brooke Williamsonultimately decide who wins the life-changing grand prize that literally follows in Julia's footsteps: an all-expense paid three-month cooking course at Le Cordon Bleu.Working in conjunction with The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts to ensure this series reflects Julia's incredible talent and heart, each episode features two rounds of competitive cooking: the first-round masters the basics and challenges the competitors to recreate one of Julia's signature dishes, with some guidance from Julia herself, as seen on a giant television screen in the middle of the action.  Round two is an ode to Julia, where competitors must take inspiration from Julia to create a unique dish reflecting their own culinary point of view. Round two dishes are served family-style, with competitors and judges sampling each dish and sharing stories about their food and personal connection to Julia. Based on performance, the judges name one winner and send one competitor home each week, until the last cook standing is awarded the ultimate grand prize.",
