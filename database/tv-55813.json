  "overview": "Freshmen often win by mistakes and come to dormitory 0. The fantasy of beautiful campus life did not come as expected, but three roommates who hadn't graduated for ten thousand years came like a nightmare: the rich black cat Edison, the irritable raccoon Jia Hero, and the weird hedgehog Ruan Xiang. Fall into the abyss. The four partners are together, causing trouble, doing things, laughing and tearing, sharing joys and sorrows. Will the pure and ever-victorious realize his dream? Will the three \"weirds\" turn to the sun and find the meaning and direction of life?",
