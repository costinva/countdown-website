  "overview": "From a \"serial murder case\" to the \"medical school dismemberment case\", Wei Guo Ping has never given up on his pursuit of justice. In a story that spans eight years, he represents the People's Police during the 1990s resolutely cracking down on illegal forces in that era. In 1988, criminal policeman Wei Guo Ping witnessed the deaths of his comrades during an operation around a serial murder case where the culprit escapes. This has left Wei Guo Ping scarred from the incident. Eight years later, the appalling corpse dismemberment case has shocked the city of Ningjiang. At this time, Wei Guo Ping has already grown into a seasoned police captain. In leading his team's investigation, he successively uncovers many related cases. However, the dismemberment case continues to be shrouded in mystery and many clues lead back to the serial murder eight years ago. These discoveries push Wei Guo Ping to work even harder but they also serve to hinder his judgment. In the process, the police narrow down on a notorious organization.",
