  "overview": "The battle between good and evil is as old as time itself. But the line between the two is often blurred…and sometimes, what side you stand for is simply a matter of perspective. This fascinating subject matter is the focus of WWE Evil, an entertaining psychological exposé into the minds of the most diabolical villains in WWE history. Journey into the deepest and darkest recesses of these WWE Superstars' psyches, uncovering dastardly secrets and exploring the real-life motivations for their turn to the dark side. Examine the ultimate rogues in WWE; from the \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, The Miz, and \"Legit Boss\" Sasha Banks, to the \"Billionaire Princess\" Stephanie McMahon, \"The Viper\" Randy Orton and \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, to the \"Brothers of Destruction\" and the \"Head of the Table\" himself, Roman Reigns! Discover why there is no light without darkness, and why there can be no hero…without a true villain.",
