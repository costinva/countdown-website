  "overview": "Story of Cool takes a look back at what Americans have considered \"cool\" throughout the decades and examines the people, places, and things that define this ubiquitous, amorphous word. Each episode explores a new element of \"cool\" - the rise of prominent leaders, product advertisements, and how the battle for \"cool\" has the power to create rivalries and elevate cultural icons that shape the world.",
