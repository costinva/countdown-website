  "overview": "The SEC on CBS (branded as The Home Depot SEC on CBS for sponsorship reasons) is the branding used for broadcasts of Southeastern Conference college football games that are produced by CBS Sports, the sports division of the CBS television network in the United States. CBS has been a television partner with the SEC since 1996, when the network returned to carrying regular-season college football on a weekly basis during the season. Televised games featuring teams outside the Southeastern Conference are branded as College Football on CBS. CBS has been televising college football games since it launched a sports division, and did so on a weekly basis during a period from the 1950s to 1966, when ABC gained exclusive rights to all NCAA regular season games. During that time period, CBS used Joe Hasel, Bob Neal, Mal Stevens, Jack Drees, Francis Wallace, Tom Harmon, and Gil Stratton as commentators. Drees was usually paired on commentary with Wallace on Midwest games, while Hasel and subsequently, Neal was paired with Stevens on Eastern regional games, and Harmon was paired with Stratton in games taking place on the West Coast. CBS was reduced to airing the Cotton Bowl Classic, which it had aired since 1958. It added the Sun Bowl in 1968, which continues to air on CBS as of 2019. From 1974 to 1977, it also aired the Fiesta Bowl, and from 1978 to 1986 it carried the Peach Bowl. ",
