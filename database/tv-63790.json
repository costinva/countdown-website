  "overview": "Kingdom of Dreams will be a visually dazzling chronicle of the fashion world spanning three decades - from the early-1990s to the 2010s. It is a Golden Age, a time when the forces of ground-breaking creativity and disruptive business converge and collide. Fashion explodes out of the traditional, elite kingdoms of haute couture and style - Paris, Milan, London and New York - to become a truly global phenomenon.Â ",
