  "overview": "MTV Video Music Awards Latinoamérica or VMALA's) (also known as Premios MTV Latinoamérica) was the Latin American version of the Video Music Awards. They were established in 2002 to celebrate the top music videos of the year in Latin America and the world. Until 2004, all the VMALAs were held in Miami. The 2005 edition was the first one planned to be held outside the United States, but the show was cancelled. The 2006 VMALAs (Premios MTV Latinoamérica) were held in Mexico City, and therefore were the first ones to actually be celebrated in Latin America. In 2008 the show was known as Los Premios MTV and in 2010 the awards were cancelled. The statues given to winners of the award are called \"Lenguas\" because the statue is of a tongue. This is because, according to MTV, \"the tongue is what brings all Latin America together as a whole\".",
