  "overview": "Ursäkta röran (vi bygger om) was a Swedish television programme that involved Filip Hammar and Fredrik Wikingsson making fun of both famous and unknown people using a hidden camera and similar setups. The jokes were of a rather unusual, sometimes experimental, nature and some viewers took offense, feeling that the pair were humiliating innocent people.",
