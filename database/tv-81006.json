  "overview": "Petr Kratov is a former military surgeon, a luminary of medicine. A former respected member of society, a former exemplary family man. Now Petr works as a paramedic in an ambulance team, and lives in the house of his eldest sonViktor - the head of the department for combating drug trafficking. Victor, out of a sense of filial duty, pulled his father out of the bottom, paid for treatment at a clinic for addiction, settled him in his place, and found a job for his father through friends.In the ambulance, Kratov is half-jokingly calledHippocrates - because of the rhyme with the surname and for his morbid commitment to the oath to help any patient in need of help.A redistribution of the drug market is taking place in the city, and Kratov, against his will, is forced not only to help the leader of a criminal group, of which his youngest son is a member, but also to hide his affairs from his son, a policeman, who is determined to destroy this group.",
