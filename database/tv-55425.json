  "overview": "Niecy Nash hosts the all-new version of the popular game show Don't Forget the Lyrics!, challenging contestants' musical memory, as they get one song closer to winning $1 million if they Don't Forget the Lyrics! Contestants will choose songs from different genres, decades and musical artists, then they'll take center stage to sing alongside the studio band as the lyrics are projected on screen - but suddenly the music will stop, and the words will disappear. Will the contestants belt out the correct missing lyrics, or freeze under pressure? If they sing nine songs correctly, they are presented with a No. 1 hit and sing the final missing lyrics for the top prize of $1 million. It's that simple: 10 songs, some missing lyrics, $1 million.",
