  "overview": "In David Tutera: Unveiled, viewers will see celebrity wedding planner David Tutera journey through one of the most dramatic years of life: his almost ten-year marriage has ended and he's having a baby! In the midst of planning for the birth of his child and overseeing a creative empire, David juggles demanding brides, dueling in-laws and sulky teenagers as they hurtle towards the big day. Getting there isn't always easy, but David's creativity, vision and daringness always surface as he transforms their muddle-headed ideas into dream weddings or sumptuous events.",
