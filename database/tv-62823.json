  "overview": "Much-loved antique dealer, Paul Martin, will go head-to-head with a rival expert as they compete to make the most at auction in a fun, yet fiercely competitive new format. Filmed throughout the country, each episode will see the competing experts take part in a number of entertaining ‘challenges' before auctioning their goods at the end of each day. From persuading the public to let them sell their beloved family heirlooms, to beating the clock, and discovering the towns' most valuable items, to standing on the rostrum and convincing the public to part with their hard-earned cash - who will be crowned Britain's best auctioneer of the week? ",
