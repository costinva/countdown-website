  "overview": "The Big Fib is a fun-loving comedy game show hosted by Yvette Nicole Brown and featuring Rhys Darby as her robot sidekick, C.L.I.V.E. Each episode stars a kid who asks questions to figure out which adult know-it-all is the real expert and who is the liar. In this era of \"fake news,\" here's an entertaining way to encourage kids (and everyone!) to ask the right questions and think for themselves.",
