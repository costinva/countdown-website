  "overview": "Design Star: Next Gen will feature eight finalists who are talented designers, renovators and social media brand-builders as they compete in intense weekly challenges. In the end, only one competitor will win the once-in-a-lifetime prize of $50,000 and their very own HGTV show.In a new twist, the series will be shot in an isolated \"design hub\" community away from typical production locations. Each competitor will be given a design lab - a house-like space that must be reimagined for each challenge. The community also will provide everything the competitors need, including a design center for sketching, a construction workshop to build their creations, as well as a fully stocked furniture and styling warehouse so they can focus on making gorgeous spaces.",
