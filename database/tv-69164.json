  "overview": "Angry Birds Mystery Island will follow three new hatchlings — Mia, Rosie, and Buddy — and a foreign-exchange piglet named Hamylton on their all-expenses-paid island getaway, where they find themselves mistakenly catapulted onto an uncharted island. Left to explore the exotic sights, smells, and unexplained phenomena of their new environment without any adults around, the ragtag bunch quickly learns that, in order to survive and make it back home, they will need to unlock the mysteries of the island together.",
