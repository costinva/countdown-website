  "overview": "The series, about married couple David and Lori Randall and their array of adopted children from all walks of life, was pulled by CBS after six episodes. It returned three months later with a new title -- Nothing Is Easy -- new opening credits, a new theme song, and a new cast member (Julia Migenes). What it didn't return with was star Elliott Gould, who had his character killed off and half of his episodes shelved. Together We Stand was more or less a remake of an episode of The Brady Bunch called Kelly's Kids, which Sherwood Schwartz unsuccessfully tried to sell as a spinoff series twelve years earlier.",
