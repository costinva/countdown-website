  "overview": "In a kingdom where time flows like a waterfall, among the majestic palaces and silks, the story of Shanguan Qi unfolds. She was a student whose life changed dramatically when she fell asleep reading manhua. She found herself in the body of a young Empress, a beautiful woman surrounded by palace intrigues and difficult relationships. Along with greatness and luxury, she shared the burden of responsibility, as well as difficult feelings for the man Chu Qing. He was a mysterious and unpredictable ruler whose heart was shrouded in the ice of hatred and resentment towards his deserted lover. He began to notice the changes. He saw that she had changed. She was caring, kind and above all gentle. And gradually his hatred began to melt, replacing the unexpected love. But the happiness did not last long. She did not belong to this world and was soon to return to her own. Her return meant not only saying goodbye to the man she loved, but perhaps losing her memories of him. And it became an unbearable pain. She had to make the hard decision to stay here and forget about her old life forever, or return to her own world, keeping her memories, but losing someone she loved forever.",
