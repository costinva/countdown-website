  "overview": "Each of these paintings hides a unique story in which the fates of the heroes and the artists themselves are intertwined. What was the fate of the boy Vasyatka from the \"Troika\" of Vasily Perov? Has Ivan Shishkin really never painted bears? Why did Viktor Borisov-Musatov see ghosts? And is it true that it was the \"Defeated Demon\" that played a fatal role in the fate of Mikhail Vrubel? The answers to all these questions are in the film almanac \"Art and Fact\"",
