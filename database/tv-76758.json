  "overview": "Ever since he can remember, Salil has been dreaming about a man in traditional Thai clothes. In every full moon night, that man will appear with the sweet scent of Kannika flowers and leave it beside a beautiful face that sleeps with sweet dreams before disappearing without a trace. However... when Salil turns 18 years old, that man disappeared from Salil's dream and life, not even saying goodbye. But then a strange feeling regurgitates his childhood memories again when Salil meets Suriyen, the CEO of the one of Asia's largest gem import company. From interns in the jewelry design department, Salil has to be a secretary in the president's office instead.",
