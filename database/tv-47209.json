  "overview": "1993. 14-year—old Sanka Ryabinin lives an ordinary teenage life - looking for adventures, trying to protect himself from district hooligans, does not want to go to the music room, does not know how to communicate with girls and from whom to take an example from adults. On the one hand, there is an honest but poor family with a saleswoman mom and an associate professor dad, on the other — the dangerous world of the Afghan veteran Uncle Alik. And then there's the girl Zhenya, whose acquaintance triggers a series of irreversible events that will forever change the lives of Sanka, his family and friends Vovka and Ilyusha. Escaping from the hooligans, Sanka steals the car of a local crime boss, and in an instant everything changes. And then there are fights with adult Caucasians, peers, between parents in the kitchen, with their boys, and so on. Will he be able to cope with all the problems, being in the very heart of events? Will he be able to save his family and finally understand who he is? Only one thing is clear – life will not be the same as before. Neither for Sanka himself, nor for the whole of Russia.",
