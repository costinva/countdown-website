  "overview": "Every year, hundreds of wanted Americans flee to Mexico to evade justice, thinking once they've crossed the border, they're home free. What these fugitives don't know is that there's an elite Mexican police unit whose sole mission is to catch them. In this groundbreaking new series, viewers follow this undercover unit as they investigate, track, and capture American fugitives. With intel from the FBI, DEA, US Marshals and Mexican authorities, this taskforce locates and apprehends US fugitives hiding out in Mexico to hand them over to law enforcement in the US to face justice for their crimes.",
