  "overview": "A new girl faces plenty of challenges where she joins the school cheerleading squad – like gossip, backstabbing … and murder. When Luna, a talented gymnast, is awarded a bursary to a prestigious private school she could never afford, she is thrust into the cut-throat world of an elite group of drum majorettes, aka \"trompoppies\". After a hazing ritual goes badly wrong, cheerleaders start turning up dead and the seemingly perfect facade of the community begins to crumble.",
