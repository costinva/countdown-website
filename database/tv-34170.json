  "overview": "From 1978 to 1985 Alan Lomax traveled the American South and Southwest with a television crew to document regional folklore with deep historical roots. The resulting 500 hours of footage became the five-program series American Patchwork, which aired on PBS in 1991. Written, produced, and directed by Lomax, the series is an engaging and edifying celebration of American traditional music and expression.",
