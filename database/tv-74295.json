  "overview": "In Man over woord, Pieter Embrechts does not look for the rules, but for the beauty and secrets of our language. Why do the West-Flemish have such a hard time with the difference between g and h? How many words does a person know and where do we get them? In these busy, busy times, do we also talk faster than in the past, and do Limburgers really speak slower than the other Flemish people? In his quest, Pieter meets ordinary people and top experts, and he discovers the craziest things. That the most difficult sentence you can make in Dutch only counts three words. That Ghent really is as unique as Ghent's thinking. What an unlikely world trip some words made before they ended up in our language.",
