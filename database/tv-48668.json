  "overview": "Three veteran cops who once dominated the police force have to come up with innovative methods to deal with a new kind of crime. Known at the trident, Cui Tiejun, Xu Guozhu and Pan Hongha who have all retreated to the second line of defence suddenly come upon a complex money laundering scheme. They face off with an opponent from 20 years ago and various forces seeking to take advantage. Crime has found new means of hacking to obtain large sums of money. The trident employs the best weapons at their disposal as they resort to old school sleuthing skills in an attempt to bring down the crime syndicate in one fell swoop.",
