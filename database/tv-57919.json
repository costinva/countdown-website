  "overview": "Host Mike Davidson is on a globetrotting mission to get an up-close look at some of the most incredible machines on Earth and to meet the hard-hat heroes that keep them running. This six-part series will take us from the forests of the Pacific Northwest for a heli-logging expedition, to the jungles of the Panama Canal for some big track repairs, to the Alps of Switzerland aboard one of Europe's busiest haulers, and detail how each team overcomes violent storms, mechanical failures, arctic conditions, and more to keep their machines operating.",
