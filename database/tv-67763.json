  "overview": "When a mysterious rival uses a time machine to frame famous Edwardian-era Detective William Murdoch of a murder he didn't commit, Macy and her friends travel back to 1910 to determine the real perpetrator of the crime. But if you thought solving a regular murder mystery was difficult, imagine doing so undercover, in a time that isn't your own, and without the aid of modern technology. To make matters worse, if Macy doesn't succeed in exonerating Detective Murdoch, she faces a terrible fate â€” being erased from the future!",
