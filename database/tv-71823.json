  "overview": "Yong'an, the capital city, fell into chaos due to the collapse of the West Canal. Shen Wenqi, the Minister of Works in charge of the construction, was implicated overnight and thrown into prison. \"When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact.\" Shen Wenqi's two daughters, Shen Ran and Shen Zhen, found themselves trapped in a dilemma one after another. Especially Shen Zhen, the youngest daughter, who had always been sheltered in seclusion and was ignorant of the world, now struggled to fend for herself on the streets. During this time, Lu Shiyan, the imperial prosecutor responsible for investigating the case, was perplexed by recurring dreams of his entanglement with a mysterious woman. After verification, he discovered that the mysterious woman in his dreams was Shen Zhen, the daughter of the guilty official. Lu Shiyan gradually approached her, stepping into an unknown fate. As they delved into the West Canal case, they experienced life and death, entrusted each other with faith, and developed a deep affection. With Shen Zhen's help, Lu Shiyan uncovered the truth behind the case. However, the true mastermind was silently closing in on the two of them.",
