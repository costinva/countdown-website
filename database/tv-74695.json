  "overview": "During Holy Week in 2024 in Morón de la Frontera, a village in Seville located next to the U.S. army base area, the American way of life coexists naturally with the traditions of the Andalusian countryside. Lucía Gutiérrez is a Civil Guard sergeant investigating the unusual suicide of a neighbor and strange events that occurred during the first Easter procession. Magaly Castillo is a U.S. Army special agent sent to the Morón de la Frontera base to find out the whereabouts of a missing American soldier who seems to be linked to the hidden business of Colonel Seamus Hoopen, head of the base area. The lone military policeman, Sergeant Andrew Taylor, accompanies Magaly in her investigations and they soon discover that the two investigations are connected and the case is far more complex than they had assumed, involving both Morón residents and American military personnel from the nearby base.",
