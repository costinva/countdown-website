  "overview": "Hosted by cook, author, columnist, radio presenter and News Breakfast foodie, Alice Zaslavsky, A Bite To Eat with Alice will focus on recipes that are simple and fresh, built around accessible and affordable ingredients that can be prepared at home to inspire Australian audiences to feel more confident in the kitchen.Alice will kickstart each episode with a recipe inspired by her special guest. Then her guest arrives, bringing in one of their favourite ingredients for Alice to turn into something delicious, showing those at home how easy it is to get dinner on the table with ingredients on hand. Finally, Alice faces a challenge to change the guest's mind about an ingredient they don't enjoy or are unsure how to cook, or to help them with a food-related issue.",
