  "overview": "In a landscape so ancient that, in parts, it predates life on the planet - are animals superbly adapted to the harsh and beautiful extremes of Outback Australia. We travel with these creatures as they work to survive the dramatic wet and dry seasons that punctuate this diverse wilderness. From its hot red heart, to its spectacular and pristine coastline, a particular breed of people also journeys through this land. This is their story - past and present, tough and tender. A spectacular adventure into the life of Australia's unique and precious North-West corner.",
