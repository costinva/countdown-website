  "overview": "The messenger of death appears on Earth under the name of Pavel, he's come to people with a warning. Death makes no exception for anyone, and thanks to Pasha, they can correct the mistakes of life before their last breath. Of course, if they believe that death is near. With each new mission, the herald grows more sympathetic to these strange people, and appreciates his work less and less. He doesn't know what love is, but he falls in love. He does not know what humor is, but he laughs more and more often. He does not know what life is, but every time he delays the moment of departure of his wards.",
