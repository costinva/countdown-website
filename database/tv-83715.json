  "overview": "If you are triggered by the phrase \"get out the double sheets of paper\", then the show \"Another School\" is for you. Journalist and blogger Alexander Murashev travels the world and shows the most progressive educational institutions. And he proves that secondary education is not necessarily boredom and cramming. An inclusive school in Estonia, the Danish Epos school with role-playing games, a school without a schedule in Israel - here children learn not only to count and write, but also to accept each other, despite all the differences.",
