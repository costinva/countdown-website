  "overview": "Don't be scared of the rickety rollercoaster or the haunted house. It's not the rides that will kill you. It's the people. Killer Carnies unravels stories of violent crime with mysterious ties to carnivals, town fairs or arcades - deceptively cheery places perfectly poised for spine-chilling horror. Each case reveals the crime scenes behind the bright lights where detectives must piece together the truth, encountering suspicious drifters and family members left devastated by tragedy. How did the epitome of American fun descend into something so deadly? In Killer Carnies, it becomes clear that it's not always fun at the fair",
