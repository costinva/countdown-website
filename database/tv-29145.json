  "overview": "Humans have long been at the top of the food chain, but what happens when the predator becomes prey? Can we survive against animals that are built stronger and faster than us? In an event where animals are guided by sheer killer instinct, mere seconds of ingenuity could make a difference between life and death. Human Prey brings you the amazing stories of those who have been attacked, and how they managed to survive despite the odds. See what happens in situations where humans have to defend themselves against an attack. From Great White sharks to grizzly bears, coyotes to crocodiles, witness incredible tales of those who have narrowly escaped the claws and jaws of death.",
