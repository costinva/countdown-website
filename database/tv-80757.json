  "overview": "Lieutenant-Colonel Zsolt Győrbíró is trying to correct an old mistake in a new NATO mission, while also trying to hold his own as a father and husband. His situation is not made easier by his old teammate, Colonel Tibor Horváth, who is playing with all his strength - if necessary, even with questionable means - to have Zsolt declared unfit to lead the mission. The life of the younger Győrbíró, the reluctant medical student Marci, is also changed by the basic training, to which her explosive father sends her as a punishment. However, the unexpected adventure makes a new man out of the boy, who finds not only a new profession, but also love.  I wonder how the mission team is assembled, who manages to get to Iraq, what happened to their teammate in the past, and will the special military unit of S.E.R.E.G. be successful in the \"revenge campaign\"? A series about a sniper soldier who was forced to work in an office after a failed mission in Iraq years ago, but now he gets a new chance: he can go into the field again. His situation is complicated by his bad relationship with Link's university son, as well as by his fellow soldier who considers him incompetent, but in the end he successfully trains a sniper platoon, with whom he goes on a mission again, putting an end to his failed mission five years earlier.",
