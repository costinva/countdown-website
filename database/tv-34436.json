  "overview": "A competition with a twist, All Together Now sees a range of talented singers take to the stage to perform in front of The 100 - a unique panel of music experts and performers from all over the UK. If any of The 100 like what they hear, they can stand up, join in and sing along. The greater the number that join in, the higher the act's score. At the end of the series, one act will walk away with the amazing cash prize. So, who can get The 100 on their feet and singing along?Each week, a whole array of talent will perform. From soloists to groups, amateurs to professionals, they're all united by a love of singing. The acts take to the stage in the hope of winning over The 100, and making it into the top three. The winner is guaranteed a place in the final, with the acts in 2nd and 3rd place each performing another great song in a dramatic sing-off. The winner of the sing-off also goes through to the final.",
