Here, the remaining competitors craft an outside-the-box burger featuring a star ingredient that pushes culinary boundaries.Finally, in the \"Big Burger Elimination\" challenge, the chefs exiled to \"Burgatory\" return for a last shot at redemption. This time, they must create a stunning gourmet burger with a delectable side, knowing that one competitor will be sent home.Week after week, the pressure mounts until only three chefs remain.
