On the eve of the next wedding anniversary, Dasha runs away from home, leaving the workaholic Veniamin a farewell letter, an engagement ring and four daughters: Lisa, Diana, Arina and Sonya. Now Veniamin, just like his father-in-law once, is forced to become a father, mother, and friend for his children.",
