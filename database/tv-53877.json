  "overview": "Everyone is hiding something. It may be a harmless secret, or it might be something far more serious: a terrible betrayal of trust or a shocking indiscretion. Some of these come out over time, while others stay hidden forever. But sometimes, an event is so horrific, so cataclysmic, that everyone's truths are laid bare. Where Murder Lies gradually exposes murder investigations one truth after another, revealing the sinister underbelly beneath seemingly placid communities.",
