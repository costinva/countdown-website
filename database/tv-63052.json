  "overview": "Los Farad will introduce the audience to the Marbella of the 1980s through Oskar, a boy with dreams of opening up a gym and who, with the help of Sara Farad, ends up getting mixed with the fascinating world of the Costa del Sol, its jetsetting lifestyle, eccentricities, and geopolitics. This new world opens up to him thanks to the Farads, a family that offers him a future, but with the most unexpected of trades: arms trafficking.",
