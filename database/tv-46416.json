  "overview": "Welcome to Flatch is a half-hour mockumentary inspired by the BBC Three format, originally created by Daisy May Cooper and Charlie Cooper. The show follows the daily lives of cousins Kelly and Shrub Mallet, who are trailed by a documentary crew who go to a small town to study young adults and their current concerns in an idiosyncratic surrounding. The show follows the pair as they pursue their dreams, confront challenges and fight each other for frozen pizza.",
