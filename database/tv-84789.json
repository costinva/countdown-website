  "overview": "A cultivator named Lü Shaoqing accidentally obtains an immortal treasure called *Chunqiu Jie* (Spring and Autumn Ring). Because of this, he is labeled as a world-destroying demon by the Righteous Dao Alliance and hunted down to his death. However, he unexpectedly travels back in time a thousand years. To his shock, he now shares the same body with the very enemy who killed him! Trapped in the enemy's stronghold, Lü Shaoqing must fight cunningly to seize control of his own body. At the same time, he gathers various rare treasures to strengthen himself. As a result, he becomes the most despised figure among the so-called righteous path—an unrestrained wanderer like no other! As his journey unfolds, the hidden secrets of the cultivation world gradually surface. When Lü Shaoqing calculates the course of history, he realizes one thing—the fate of this world has already changed!",
