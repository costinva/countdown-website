  "overview": "The Regal Princess is brand spanking new and the largest in the 18 ship fleet owned by Princess Cruises. Launched in 2014, it has 19 decks, 16 bars and restaurants, a luxury spa, fitness centre, an adults only area with luxury cabanas and hot tubs and even a daily orchestrated fountain display â€“ packed with mums, dads, kids and couples.We've all see these ships on holidays but what does it take to manoeuvre such a gigantic ship across the globe? We'll follow the best crew and the most exciting action from the ship's bridge. We see how Captain Ed Perrin and his senior team plan their operations; revealing the challenges of being in a mix of seas, climates and conditions.Arriving in centuries old harbours and navigating narrow coastal sailing routes, how does a giant, mega cruiser from the 21st Century find its way in and out of these places? At 1,083 feet long, it's longer than the Shard!",
