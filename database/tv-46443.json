  "overview": "Welcome to the chaos, infighting and colorful personalities of the people behind the bench and behind the scenes at the Queens County Courthouse in New York. Judge Jack Moran is a brilliant, cynical judge whose wisdom is often overshadowed by his bizarre courtroom behavior. Newly appointed Judge Kim Vicidomini is quickly proving that her political connections and legal savvy are assets both in and out of the courtroom. Judge Rose Barnea is hardworking and brutally frank, and Judge Thomas O'Neill is the highest-ranking judge at the courthouse and works to keep his fellow judges' egos, agendas and eccentricities in check.",
