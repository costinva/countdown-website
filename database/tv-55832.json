  "overview": "In this comedic prequel event series to the Ted films, it's 1993, and Ted the bear's moment of fame has passed. He's now living back home in Framingham, Massachusetts with his best friend, 16-year-old John Bennett, along with John's parents, Matty and Susan and cousin Blaire. Ted may be a lousy influence on John, but at the end of the day, he's a loyal pal who's always willing to go out on a limb for friendship.",
