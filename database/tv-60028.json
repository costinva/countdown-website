  "overview": "Legend has it that God created the dreamlike paradise of Yun Huang. But when Na Sheng flees from the chaos plaguing her home in the Central Districts, it is clear that the Shangri-La does not live up to its legend. Nearly a century ago, Hai Guo's Prince Su Mo and Kong Sang's Crown Princess Bai Ying first encountered each other at the White Tower. Su Mo, then a mere slave, had to cure the boredom of Bai Ying, bride to Kong Sang's Crown Prince Zhen Lan. A mere three years in Su Mo's company had her falling for him. But fate being cruel, Bai Ying jumped off the 22-km high White Tower to embrace the wind.Â ",
