  "overview": "Your Face Sounds Familiar features eight celebrity performers transformed into different legendary icons each week.Each performs an iconic song and dance routine from that artist's catalogue. But there's a twist, the celebrities have no control over who they will perform as. Instead, they'll have to face the \"Iconizer\" at the end of each program to decide who they'll be transforming into the following week. Whether it's an older or a younger artist, or even a star of the opposite gender, the ultimate decision is down to this spinning wheel, guaranteeing hilarious and dramatic results.Performing in front of a panel of judges, the celebrities will have to impress as they sing and dance their way through to the finale. The celebrity with the most points at the end receives the top cash prize for a charity of their choice.",
