  "overview": "With a knowing wink at traditional fairy tales, Disney's Descendants fuses castles with classrooms to create a contemporary, music-driven story about the challenges adolescent offspring face in living up to parental and peer expectations. With unexpected characterization, plot twists and turns, and dashes of wry humor, the movie is designed to appeal to kids and grownups alike as its story playfully presents the possibilities of what happened after the \"happily ever after.\" Driven by exciting music and performance, the story is set in the idyllic kingdom of Auradon.",
