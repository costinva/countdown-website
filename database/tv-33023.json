  "overview": "Ballroom Bootcamp is the series where three \"Average Joes or Janes\" from all walks of life undertake a rigorous five-week training program. Top ballroom dance professionals Susannah Cuesta, Gocha Chertkoev and Christian Perry will attempt to give the participants the physical, mental and social tools necessary for success, and stop at nothing to transform the participants from ordinary to extraordinary. The Ballroom Bootcamp participants will learn one of five dance styles - the cha-cha, waltz, tango, jive or rhumba - and then face off against one another in an authentic, professionally adjudicated competition.",
