  "overview": "Early pioneers, scouts, hunters, and traders fulfill America's destiny to expand Westward, exploring uncharted territory to blaze new trails. While dangers of deadly predators, starvation, bad weather, and unwelcoming Native Americans linger around every corner, the promise of land and opportunity push brave men like Daniel Boone, Kit Carson, and John Colter to keep going. Within the epic adventures and survival of the early settlers lies the origins of Western lore and the creation of legends that live on forever.",
