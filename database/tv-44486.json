  "overview": "In disagreement with his hierarchy, for incompatibility of spirit and method, Sauveur Giordano left his position as number two in the Minors Brigade. As a citizen reflex, he chose to work for the \"Ultime defense\" victim support association, run by Louise Ventura. There, he exercises his talents as a solo detective to save the poorest of whom he is the last resort. Giordano is a maverick whose activities come up against official police investigations. Conflict is then inevitable. Make justice triumph over injustice: if his motto is simple, his fight is complex and constantly repeated.",
