  "overview": "Oxygen turns a comic eye to the search for the next Fabio. In Mr. Romance, Oxygen's newest comedy/reality series, aspiring Adonis's compete to see who will grace the cover of the next Harlequin romance novel. Created by Gene Simmons of KISS, Mr. Romance chronicles the trials and tribulations of 12 beefy guys who enter a veritable romance boot camp and prepare to compete in the Mr. Romance man-pageant. The winner walks away with guaranteed appearances on Harlequin romance book covers and a $50,000 cash prize. With no elimination until the final pageant, the season finale dramatically culminates with a grand man-pageant in front of a live, all-female studio audience and a panel of celebrity judges and romance professionals.",
