  "overview": "The mice come to Earth (not by accident this time, unlike the first series). In this series, the lead antagonists are the evil Catatonians, a cat-like race of creatures who desire the greatest prize on Mars, the Regenerator. In the process of obtaining it they destroy it, leaving the Biker Mice to flee to Earth to build a new one.",
