  "overview": "Franky is a girl unlike any other. She's a robot girl! She looks like a 14-year-old teenager, but she's actually a secret project created by Sofia, a scientist Franky calls \"Mom.\" Although Franky's brain operates like a state-of-the-art supercomputer with unlimited internet access and a large storage memory, that's not enough to pass for a human teen: Franky doesn't know what feelings are or what they're for, nor does she understand jokes or double meanings. And of course, she's incapable of experiencing any emotions. Of course, the biggest challenge will be falling in love... without crashing her operating system!",
