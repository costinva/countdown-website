  "overview": "Trust No One is a high-stakes thriller about leadership, how lonely it gets at the top, and the death of privacy. The youngest-ever director of the most powerful intelligence agency in Israel, Itamar has forged a career recruiting and handling well-connected informants. Now Itamar is facing the crisis of his life: a cyber security leak is exposing the Israeli Security Agency's (ISA) top-secret agents one by one - starting with Shuruk, daughter of a Hamas leader who he recruited to spy on her own father when she was just 17 years old. Itamar turns to his protégé Yali, a cyber security genius who turned her back on the ISA. Recently released from prison, Yali agrees to help but quickly discovers she's being framed as the source of the leaks. As the leaks continue and more lives are threatened, Itamar does everything to protect his exposed operatives in a race against time. As they close in on the truth together, Itamar's family becomes entangled, forcing him to choose between them, the lives of his operatives, and the career he loves.",
