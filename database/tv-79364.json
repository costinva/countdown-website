Her father takes in the boys to grow up together as a family. Despite being unrelated by blood, Ju-won adores San-ha and Hae-jun and thinks of them as her brothers, no matter how differently others think or say. They reunite after a decade apart - facing new dynamics, unresolved pain and the complexities of adulthood.",
