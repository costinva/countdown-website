Maruya Kosuke is a 29-year-old employee at a beer manufacturer who works in the sales department and comes from a rich family that owns a brewery. Since he was young, he has been popular thanks to his good looks and always receives confessions of love from women. However, he gets a rude awakening one day when he realizes that his cuteness has an expiration date.
