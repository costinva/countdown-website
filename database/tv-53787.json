  "overview": "Illegal activities are said to be taking place in a warehouse. So two commissioners observe the building night after night. But nothing is happening. Nothing at all. So the two of them begin to tell stories from their private lives - sometimes very grotesque. In the control room of the police station, it is similar because of sheer boredom. What the officers don't know: in the warehouse, the two criminals also tell outrageous stories from their eventful past.Â ",
