  "overview": "A redemptive tale of family, Essex County tells the story of four disparate characters linked together through bloodlines. From old Uncle Lou, to young Lester, to Anne the country nurse and Ken, the stoic farmer, the four lead characters ebb and flow into each other's lives, slowly weaving connections between them that ultimately save and redeem them.",
