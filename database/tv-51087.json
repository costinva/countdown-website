  "overview": "Suspicion is a contagion. What starts as a tiny spark of doubt focused on one individual can metastasize and cast a shadow on everything you, your community, and ultimately law enforcement thought to be true. Each episode of Suspicious Minds creates a visceral viewing experience where a murder mystery unfolds as a psychological thriller where suspicion and doubt cloud the perceptions of everyone involved.Â ",
