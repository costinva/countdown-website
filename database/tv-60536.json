  "overview": "Stripped over four nights, this ground-breaking series tells the story of the London Major Trauma System. Set up in the wake of the London bombings of 2005, it's a unique interconnected network of hospitals, air ambulances and paramedics that provide a lifeline for 10 million people in London and the South-East. A system that has improved the chances of survival for major trauma patients by 50%. Filmed during the busiest month of last summer, the series follows the minute-by-minute decisions made by some of the country's top medics, as they treat the most critically injured patients. ",
