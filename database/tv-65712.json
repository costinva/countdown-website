  "overview": "Fragments recounts the reunion, after more than 30 years of silence, of Paul-André Denis, François Bibeau and Marlène Cormier in somewhat unusual circumstances. In the loop, there is also the place that Renaud Dagenais now occupies in the life of Paul-André and Marlène. And the one once occupied by Jacynthe Nadeau, who died too young and emblematic figure of the legendary Victo Quartet. What will François' return to the lives of Paul-André and Marlène cause? And what will be the impact on their children, Tomas, Céleste and Edouard, now adults?",
