  "overview": "Host John Catucci (You Gotta Eat Here!) takes viewers on a one-of-a-kind food adventure across North America as he checks buzz-worthy, crazy, delicious food off his bucket list. In each episode, John visits the restaurants behind these must-eat meals and hits the kitchen to lend a helping hand and learn how the chefs make their mind-blowing creations. We're talking sticky, saucy Missouri-style ribs, Nova Scotia's straight from the sea, succulent lobster, Vancouver B.C.'s crispy, out of this world fried chicken, and Irvine, Calf.'s overloaded spaghetti grilled cheese you have to see to believe. John's setting out to eat each and every drool-worthy dish, and check them off his Big Food Bucket List.",
