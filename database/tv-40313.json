On the run from a troubled past, he blows into Sydney where he lands a job as a bouncer at a notorious illegal casino in Kings Cross. A classic fish out of water who's desperate to get home, he soon finds himself seduced by the city's illicit charms and dragged into a web of underground criminality.",
