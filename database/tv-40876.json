  "overview": "People involved with extraordinary events tell their stories through recordings made at the time. The stories are told moment by moment, in first person, in real time. No narrator. No talking heads. In Their Own Words is the closest thing to being an eyewitness, thanks to first-hand storytelling with no filters.",
