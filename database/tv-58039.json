  "overview": "The police station in the Berlin district of Köpenick is getting a new and unusual team: The former chief detective Robert Heffler, a single father of three daughters, was transferred to Berlin-Köpenick three years ago for personal reasons by the permanent detective service from a hotspot area as a dispatcher. Due to a lack of staff, at the request of department head Katharina Koblinsk, he is now to support the new colleague, Chief Detective Kay Freund, in a tricky murder case on the Spree. Freund is young and described as risk-taking and workaholic. Their first case together leads them to an unknown corpse in the Spree, which was stunned, slain and thrown into the water. In the course of the investigation, Heffler is confronted with his own past.",
