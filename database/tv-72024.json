  "overview": "Once upon a time, friends whose student years fell on the difficult 90s, left all over the country to arrange their lives. Nevertheless, they still actively communicate online and meet every 10 years to celebrate the anniversary of their beloved teacher Petrovich. Meanwhile, their children have already grown up and have begun to form their attitude to life: someone is trying to realize their career ambitions, someone is shirking all business, someone is eating up parental money intended for study. The novels will tell about the heroes' trips to different cities, during which they will reconsider their relationship with their parents and the country.",
