Music journalist Lev Gankin takes a tour of different eras and countries, telling how artists of all stripes were banned.Nina Simone, Prince, Michael Jackson, Turkish opera singer Ruhi Su and Soviet rockers - they all faced repression and were forced to defend their right to free creativity. And sometimes even the right to life.",
