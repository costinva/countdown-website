  "overview": "Ethan and Casey Jones met in the seventh grade, married after college, and around their 10-year anniversary decided to give their six-year-old daughter Eliot a baby sister or brother. Instead, the couple welcomed quints: Brooklyn, Ryan, Jack, Britton, and Lila. Throughout the series, viewers watch the Jones' as they navigate the obstacles and the joys of raising a family when everything is multiplied by five.Five more babies leads to five times the expenses from cribs to diapers to play toys. In the premiere episode of Quints by Surprise the family decides to downsize and put their Austin, Texas home on the market and hold an open house. This means a day out and playtime at the local pool for energetic Eliot and her 17-month-old quintuplet sisters and brother. Never a dull moment, this family goes through all the trials and tribulations many other American families are facing just multiplied by six.",
