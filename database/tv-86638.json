  "overview": "Operative Max Goryachev and police officer Ihor Bezhatchenko are another duet of cop-partners who prove that heroes do not have to look alike in order to successfully investigate cases. However, due to radically different characters and approaches to investigation, the heroes often have quarrels with each other, and because of this, unpleasant incidents at work. Max is used to acting sharply and without hesitation, but independently. After the sudden death of his wife, psychologists forbade him to go out on business alone. Max gets Ihor Bezhatchenko, a balanced provincial family man, as his partner. From the first minutes of acquaintance, the heroes understand that difficult times have begun: Max will have to endure instructions, and Igor - to constantly take risks.",
