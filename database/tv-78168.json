  "overview": "A delinquent 2nd-year student becomes the chairman of the board of a prestigious high school left behind by his father. Na Yi Soo may have grown up in an environment that others would envy, but he harbors hatred for his father and heads to Balhae High School, which his father cherished, in order to seek revenge. The process of change between Yi Soo, who has lived a rougher life than anyone else, and the nation's most elite students who have lived upright lives, as they get to know each other, and the love that blooms in the process, will be dynamically unfolded.",
