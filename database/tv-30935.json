  "overview": "Combines tear-jerking poignancy with inspiring stories of human endeavour. Each episode of Lost and Found follows a live lost case, tracking the search for a missing dog in real time whilst also shining a light on a canine rescue charity as they work tirelessly to re-homeunwanted and abandoned dogs. Thousands of dogs go missing every year, and this ambitious format accesses rescue centres and the nationwide army of volunteers on standby to mobilise and help reunite distraught owners with their beloved dogs. Lost and Found is a multi-narrative documentary format with nail-biting lost stories that pack a real emotional punch, but it's also heart-warming and informative with no small measure of happy endings and wagging tails.",
