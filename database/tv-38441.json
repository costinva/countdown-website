  "overview": "Mike, Pi, Marcello, Bec and Ram are smart, creative but radically different kids who have just scored part-time jobs testing prototype computer games. It's a blast, but it's not just computer programs that are being tested - loyalties, friendships and values are also on the line in the funny, compelling world that is the Crash Zone.",
