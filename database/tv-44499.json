  "overview": "A crazy comedy inspired by the sitcom, Quarter Life follows the adventures of three friends who struggle to find their place in a world where, in their twenties, there are three ways to fulfill themselves: by starting a family, by creating Facebook or by participating in Occupation Double. Thus, when her boyfriend announces to her in surprise that he has bought a house so that they can start a family, Ariane, mid-twenties, decides to flee. Lost, homeless and penniless, she meets Constance and Bam, two unbalanced but well-meaning roommates who take her under their wing. Together, the three friends will discover through fiascos that there is only one way to get out of the quarter-life crisis alive: it is by being surrounded by friends who are as disoriented as you are.",
