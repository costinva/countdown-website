  "overview": "A Plan to Kill is a true-crime series that examines the story of sadistic and meticulous killers who plan their victims' murders for weeks, months or even years. Each stand-alone episode is brought to life through a tapestry of firsthand interviews with investigators and those close to the victim. Over the course of the hour, we'll follow detectives on a winding investigation. They'll work through dead ends, red herrings and misdirects planted by the killer to throw them off... all in their quest to identify the guilty party and bring them to justice.Â ",
