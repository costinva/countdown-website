  "overview": "Murder in the Heartland is a harrowing narrative that recounts the stories of humble Middle-American towns - and the provocative crimes that tore through them. Each town's tale is voiced by the combined perspectives of its residents, but these citizens are more than just storytellers. All interviewees were key witnesses to each of the crimes, having held critical clues to the puzzle that forever changed their lives... and their sense of \"home\".",
