  "overview": "Under the city Investigative Committee there is an operational department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It so happened that the employees of this department almost always have the hottest cases. Tasks to be completed within the next 48 hours. And if they do not have time, the irreparable may happen - either the prestige of the country or human life is at stake, or there is a high risk that the main suspect will leave justice, have time to destroy evidence or a witness.",
