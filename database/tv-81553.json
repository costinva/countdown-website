  "overview": "After some business between Aristides Ruiz and Rodrigo Arciniegas, which ends in the death of Aristides, his two daughters: Mariana and Isabela are separated and take completely different paths. On the one hand, Mariana, who changes her name to Soledad, is raised in humility and poverty, together with an adoptive mother and her grandmother, making her a hard-working and simple girl, but on the other hand, her sister Isabela is raised in luxury and comforts, and that is why it is arrogant and capricious. However, fate will make these two sisters meet again but in a not very favorable way, since both are in love with the same man, Alejandro Arciniegas, son of the murderer of their father.",
