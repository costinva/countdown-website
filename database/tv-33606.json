  "overview": "Jose and Lucia lead a happy life together in rural Spain. He runs his trucking company, while she stays at home to look after their young son, who was born with a heart condition but is getting better following surgery. One morning, Lucia drops Jose off at the airport as he is due to leave the country on a short business trip. Some hours later, her whole world collapses when breaking news reports that his flight has crashed, leaving no survivors. And yet it soon emerges that Jose's name is not on the passenger list and in fact, he never boarded the plane at all. Though he eventually returns to her, the accident serves to highlight that Jose has some dark and dangerous secrets that he has been hiding from Lucia, and though he protests his innocence, she is determined to get to the bottom of her husband's business.",
