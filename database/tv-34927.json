  "overview": "Former Project Runway alum, Chris March, has something up his sleeve in Mad Fashion; from start to finish, viewers will see March and his eccentric crew as they create one-of-a-kind designs for his high-profile clientele. No creation or idea is too crazy for this team as they design Jennifer Coolidge's Mardi-Gras float ensemble and model Chrissy Teigen's gown for the MET Costume Gala. Tensions rise as March pushes the boundaries of fashion and challenges his clients' comfort zones. In the end, will the design fulfill the client's fashion fantasy or will it turn out to be more than they can handle?",
