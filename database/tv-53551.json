  "overview": "Nugget Nose is the short and feisty ghost of an Old West gold prospector who finds adventure riding his invisible horse. He is also a guardian to Wendy and Rita, two young cowgirls who work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch owned by grouchy, old Fenwick Fuddy. Whenever Fuddy threatens to fire the girls, Nugget makes himself invisible and becomes a helping friend. He is always battling Fuddy and takes delight in harassing him in odd and humorous ways. When the girls are in trouble, Wendy summons Nugget by rubbing on her special gold nugget necklace.",
