  "overview": "Paz is a self-centered influencer who arrives in the town of Água-Marinha, where she clashes with a local activist and is \"canceled\" for offensive insults. One hundred years earlier, in 1922, Cecília is facing a forced marriage — a life she doesn't want — in Água-Marinha after her parents' death. Mysteriously, the universe gives the two women an exit as they are swapped into each other's bodies.",
