  "overview": "High Flyers traces the lives of a group of ordinary kids, sharing their disappointments and triumphs as they discover their collective talents in an extraordinary children's circus. When Luke and Phoebe move to the country, first impressions of their new home aren't encouraging. New school, no friends, in the middle of nowhere â€” who needs it? But when they discover it has its own circus for kids, the dramas, adventures, relationships and backflips unfold.",
