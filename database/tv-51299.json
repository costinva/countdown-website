  "overview": "According to the plot, the seaside adventurer Artem, who came from Mineralnye Vody Maga, the aspiring blogger from Kazan Nailya and the intelligent Kaliningrader Varya accidentally become the owners of a fairly large sum of money, which literally falls on them from the wall of the legendary high-rise in the center of Moscow. But, as it turns out later, even this \"easy\" money, according to the laws of the capital, needs to be earned. The guys are helped in this by their neighbors in the house. The former ballerina Elena Sergeevna, who lives on the floor above, knows not only classical steps, but also the capital before the times of \"Moscow-City\", a young British man in love with Russian culture, who rents a room in the same house, as well as young guys from Tajikistan, who are doing repairs in the neighboring apartment.",
