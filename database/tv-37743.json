  "overview": "Intresseklubben is based on the British show QI so the format is largely the same, just as in the original there are four panellists (three guest panellists and one permanent panellist). The panellists are mostly comedians, but people from other fields have also appeared. Each panellist has a buzzer that they can use to attract attention, usually the buzzers are themed to the episode's theme.",
