  "overview": "‎Resting with the staff of her department, Kawakami Anzu became ill and she stepped aside, so that no one saw her vomit. Kurado Tetsia witnessed the incident by accident. Anzu was very frightened when she saw him the next day at his work, along with Ando Kakeru. They were new employees, she had to introduce them to colleagues and show the front of the works. I liked Anza both, one beautiful and self-confident, the other modest and attentive, well, with whom she will remain, to decide only herself.‎",
