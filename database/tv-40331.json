  "overview": "Brendan's big bus is back - this time with a load of your favourite jet-setting celebs on board. International tour guide Brendan welcomes five VIP couples for a sun-soaked adventure across Spain - all of them hoping to make it from Barcelona to the final destination of glamorous Benidorm. Fame guarantees you nothing on this coach. You need to stay popular to stay put, or couples will find themselves getting voted off.",
