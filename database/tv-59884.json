  "overview": "In the period between the last days of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) and the early Republic of China (1912-1949), China is in turmoil. The forces of modernity and antiquity are slowly starting to come together, but the land is full to bursting point with sorcerers, conjurers, necromancers, and the like. Most of these, however, are nothing but charlatans and con artists. Enter Kong Xue Li, a budding young policeman, and Fang Dong, a keen-minded coroner. This duo has become myth-busting hoax detectives, using their wits and knowledge of contemporary science to expose scammers for what they really are and show that what many people mistakenly believe are supernatural spirits are actually smoke-and-mirror tricks from con artists.",
