His life changes drastically when his wife Isabel dies unexpectedly and he falls into a deep depression. Diana convinces him to fight again for the only thing that can bring him back to life. Together they will face adversity and fall in love with each other, but they do not dare to speak of love, for fear of not being reciprocated.",
