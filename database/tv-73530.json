  "overview": "The Young Kindaichi is back and better than ever! In this first of many cases, Kindaichi finds himself onboard a cruise ship in which the captainmysteriously disappears the day after a big party. A search of the ship finds nothing, except for little drops of blood on the light switch in the captain's room. Might it be a clue perhaps? You bet! When what looks to be a case of serious foul play unfolds, the ship's radio is found disabled—somuch for contacting the authorities. So, far out at sea until they can reach land, it's up to Kindaichi and friends to find the killer…and stay alive!This is the 2nd generation of Kindaichi Shonen no Jikenbo live-action TV series.",
