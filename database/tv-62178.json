  "overview": "Cristy Lee (All Girls Garage on MotorTrend TV and MotorTrend+) stars in the Detroit-based home renovation series, Steal This House. While she is known for her expertise fixing cars, trucks and bikes, Cristy's heart is in home improvement. She sees the potential in the most unexpected, inexpensive properties and works to turn them into astonishing homes. For her clients, Cristy proves that it's worth the risk to buy a lower-priced house that needs work, create a smart renovation budget and invest in a renovation to transform the place into the home of their dreams.Â ",
