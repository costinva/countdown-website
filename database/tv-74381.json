  "overview": "France, 1557. At Mespech Castle, the harmony between masters and servants is about to be broken by religious wars. Having embraced the new Protestant movement, Jean de Siorac, a well-respected humanist knight and head of his family, has no choice but to resort to violence to defend his community. His wife Isabelle, a fervent Catholic, is struggling to exist in a world ruled by men. Their sons, Pierre and Fran√ßois, are thrown into adulthood, torn asunder, just like their religiously divided country. Forced to contend with their adversaries, the Sioracs must remain close as they strive to overcome their differences and defend their ideal of tolerance.",
