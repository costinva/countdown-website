  "overview": "Top Dog centres on the clash between ambitious business lawyer Emily Jansson and the ex-crook Teddy Maksumic. A mysterious disappearance brings together two completely different worlds, and an extremely ill-matched couple - lawyer Emily and the conditionally released Teddy. The two are at loggerheads. She wants up. He wants out. She wants to secure her future; he wants to leave his old life behind. The pair are forced to rethink when they end up in a tricky situation where the past catches up, where future dreams are shattered, and where nothing is what it seems.",
