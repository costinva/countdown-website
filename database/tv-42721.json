  "overview": "In 60 Days In: Narcoland, six participants go undercover in crucial areas along I-65 – one of the biggest drug trafficking corridors in the country, encompassing six counties in Kentucky and Indiana – for a first-hand look into how drug cartels have infiltrated America's Heartland. The undercover participants have come from a variety of backgrounds to tackle the drug crisis from multiple angles. Viewers follow participants on the streets and in jail, and will also ride along with local law enforcement within the Narcotics Unit in an attempt to gain a 360-degree view of the epidemic.",
