  "overview": "Youyou was born into a wealthy and loving family, but at the age of ten, tragedy struck—her mother fell to her death, and her father was imprisoned. Ten years later, Youyou discovered that it was An Guoxuan who had orchestrated it all. In a moment of rage, she sought revenge but failed, and accidentally blinded An Guoxuan's son, Qi Dong. In retaliation, Qi Dong heartlessly threw her into the sea. Miraculously, Youyou was rescued by Madam Yu from the Yuan Bi Orphanage and sent abroad. Qi Dong, as An Guoxuan's illegitimate child, was never truly favored. After losing his sight, he was completely cast aside. Yet with sheer determination, he trained himself to function like any other person and eventually founded his own company to rival An Guoxuan's Xingyao Group. Five years later, Youyou returns in glory under the alias \"Qi Gege,\" now a top architectural designer. Major companies compete to recruit her—including Qi Dong's. She pretends to work with him, planning to use him as a stepping stone for revenge. But as they navigate their tangled pasts, Youyou begins to realize that Qi Dong's goal isn't to inherit Xingyao Group. In fact, his mother died because of An Guoxuan too, and he returned to the An family for the same reason as her—revenge. The two finally drop their masks and join forces to take An Guoxuan down. But lurking in the shadows, an even more formidable enemy has begun to make their move…",
