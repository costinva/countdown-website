Always mistreated by his parents and siblings who hate him, Ha Sinh is given to a wealthy man from the city by his Grandfather, as payment of a favor from the past, who thought this would be his best chance to have a better life. Leaving the bosom of his family, now Ha Sinh has to learn to adapt to life in the big city and deal with his new homemade: Vien Truc. At first what seemed to be a complicated and hateful relationship, then becomes friendly and loving. A different feeling between the two begins to be born and, despite trying to resist, becomes stronger than they can admit.",
