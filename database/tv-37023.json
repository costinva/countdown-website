  "overview": "In TLC's brand-new series I Want That Wedding, experienced wedding planners take their newly engaged clients to three different weddings: one that is equivalent to what the bride wants to spend, one at the groom's price point and one in-between. The twist, however, is that the couple won't know the cost of these weddings until the end of the experiment - and viewers will play along at home as they try to guess what things cost and which wedding most inspired each couple. When it's all said and done, the couples will agree on a budget and finally be able to declare I WANT THAT WEDDING!",
