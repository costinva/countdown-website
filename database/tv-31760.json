  "overview": "Most Expensivest is hosted by Grammy winning hip-hop superstar 2 Chainz who takes viewers on a charming and unexpected tour of the culture of excess. Kinetic and completely unpredictable, 2 Chainz \"investigates\" all manner of products and services, driven by a central question: Is it worth it? Is it sh*t? Or is it \"The Sh*t\"? Shot in New York City and Las Vegas, Most Expensivest dives headlong into the absurdly luxurious and will determine if $4,000 canine cologne, an $800 bottle of beer or $5,000 Chicken Wings are really worth it.",
