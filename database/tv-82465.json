  "overview": "Instant Italian works to take favorite Italian dishes and make them quick and easy for modern home cooks. Drawing on inspiration from her childhood visiting family in Calabria, Anna is known for her ingenious spins on familiar dishes. Whether she is transforming pasta with a snackable fried version (just minutes in an air fryer), perfecting a deeply flavored chicken cacciatore for an easy sheet-pan supper, or putting a creative twist on desserts like affogato mug cake and cannoli icebox cake, Anna is always finding fun and unique ways to update meals while still keeping the flavors true to their roots.",
