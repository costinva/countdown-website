  "overview": "Third grader Haneta Hiroshi buys a baby chicken at a summer festival, but rather than picking one of the more normal and adorable chicks, Haneta picks out Higepiyo, an oversized hatchling with a van dyke. The chicken vendor is desperate to get rid of the strange creature, and claims that even though it has facial hair, it's still a chick.",
