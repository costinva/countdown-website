  "overview": "One day, Crown Prince Sieg hears the Voices of the Gods out of the blue. Apparently, his fianc√©e Lieselotte is a \"tsun de rais\" villainess destined to meet her demise...and her sharp tongue is just a way of covering up her embarrassment. The prince can hardly contain himself after discovering Lieselotte's adorable hidden side. Little does he know, the heavenly beings that bestowed this knowledge unto him are actually high schoolers! Can he use their divine prophecy (let's play commentary) to save his betrothed and avoid a Bad End?!",
