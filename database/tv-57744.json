  "overview": "Follow\nHugo and Marius are two men who couldn't be more different. Who live in completely different worlds and whose paths would never cross if their daughters weren't best friends. In the new TVNOW original \"Dangerous Proximity\", the two fathers tumble inexorably towards each other in a vortex of lies, deception and violence - and a family story becomes a gripping thriller in which everything is suddenly about everything.",
