  "overview": "Crowned: The Mother of All Pageants explores one of life's most emotional and volatile relationships as mothers and daughters from all walks of life compete together - and against other mother/daughter teams - in order to win a no-holds-barred beauty pageant. Judges Carson Kressley, former Miss U.S.A. Shanna Moakler and television personality Cynthia Garrett referee an eight-episode competition that dares to pit mother/daughter teams against each other. Under the direction of pageant director Linnea Maloney, the women are faced with challenges that focus on preparing them for the pageant show finale. They will have to brand a \"style\" for their mother/daughter team via clothing and swimwear, create ways of expressing a point of view about issues in the world, and practice for the big pageant dance number. Not only do good looks, talent and a penchant for world peace have to run in the family, each team must also have patience, teamwork and a healthy sense of humor. Some teams have years of pageant experience and some teams have none. In the end, one mother/daughter team will be \"crowned\" the winner and will receive a valuable prize package, including a $100,000 cash award, and, of course, a fabulous pair of tiaras.",
