  "overview": "In the 1990s, on a night filled with thunder and lightning, a small county town called Zhaoyang witnessed the mysterious pursuit and uncertain fate of a teenager. Two other boys who disappeared with him also vanished without a trace. Three years later, one of the boys reemerged as a \"little pickpocket,\" pretending to have lost his memory and returned to his family. Behind the successful recognition, is it a reunion or a continuation of a mistake? Surprisingly, the seemingly reunited family still harbors secrets and threats. An old police officer conducts a covert investigation, and after a cat-and-mouse chase, clues about the whereabouts of the other two missing boys begin to emerge. The truths behind multiple disappearances, human trafficking, manslaughter, and murder cases gradually come to light. As the mystery unravels, the old police officer and the \"missing boy\" achieve mutual redemption, wrapping this suspenseful narrative into a story about family ties.",
