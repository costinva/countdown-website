  "overview": "Pavel Sergeevich Makarov, the head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Butovo district, is completely replaced by personnel as a result of a conflict with the leadership. Instead of experienced male operas, four young graduates of the police school are singled out. They are all very different. One is a well—read, arrogant know-it-all. The other is a beautiful, but very frivolous girl. The third is straightforward and strong, a master of simple solutions. Well, the fourth is a kind, naive young lady who has already become a mother and thinks more about her son than about work. One thing unites them all: with their inexperience, they greatly irritate the experienced mentor, who did not particularly favor women even before their appearance. Makarov will try to get rid of them, and the girls will do their best to prove that he is wrong, and they themselves did not choose this profession in vain.",
