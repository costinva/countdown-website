As a result, Team becomes more relaxed before the competition, and his sleeping issue is no longer severe. On the other hand, Win starts to feel for his junior, Team. But due to his family background, Win is a middle child who only knows how to give love but never receives one. He only knows how to treat people equally, making it harder to approach Team.
