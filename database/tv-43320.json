  "overview": "When handsome Army Surgeon Jeffrey MacDonald is sent to prison for killing his family, a storm of swirling narratives challenges our very ability to find the truth. All the while overshadowing a chilling possibility: MacDonald may be an innocent man. A Wilderness of Error examines the evidence in the case against MacDonald, who was convicted in 1979 of murdering his pregnant wife and two daughters. A Green Beret physician, MacDonald claimed that the murders were committed by drug-crazed hippies.",
