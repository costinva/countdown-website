  "overview": "Targeted assassinations, bombings, unidentified military attacks are piling up all over the Middle East. Can the \"secret war\" between Iran and Israel turn into a major regional if not global confrontation? The two countries are nowadays the two dominant powers in the Middle East. Their conflict is reinforced by the renewed tension between the United States and Iran since President Trump decided to leave the nuclear agreement. Based on unprecedented archival research, access to high profile players in Israel, Iran, Lebanon and the US, the film looks back over the forty years that followed the Islamic revolution in Iran, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Civil war in Syria, to offer relevant keys to understanding the new Middle East.",
