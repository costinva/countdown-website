  "overview": "Idol Dictation Contest is an idol version spin-off of tvN's famous program Amazing Saturday, also known as DoReMi Market. Slight variations aside, the concept of the show remains the same: each week, a South Korean food market is featured and the cast members have to win a dictation game to be able to enjoy the food. Both host Boom and mukbanger Haetnim appear on this show as well, assuming the same roles as they do on Amazing Saturday.",
