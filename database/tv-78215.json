  "overview": "Because of her bandaged face, she is called Mummy in the children's ward. In two months, disfigured Anya had to seriously grow up. Before the accident, she was a beautiful, confident schoolgirl. Afterwards - a closed, cynical creature, ready to attack even those who are trying to help her. Every day Anya looks for new reasons to live on and new tricks to stay in the hospital. After all, she recently had a goal - to kill the culprit who was lying in a coma in the very accident in which her parents died. To carry out her plan, Anya gathers a team of loser patients, but in the process of preparation she realizes that revenge is not a cure.",
