  "overview": "Alex Ramirès welcomes on his sofa the greatest shots of series and cinema. A show like you've never seen before, with guests you've probably seen before. YOU AGAIN ? It's your fake talk show that invites and has fun with the clichés of cinema and series. In each episode, Alex Ramirès receives a character who embodies a \"trope\". It's very META as they say in the movies. It's like the recipe for French toast: take everything that remains in our avid brains for fiction and make a new gourmet/crunchy dish that assumes its references and revisits them without smelling of cinnamon. ",
