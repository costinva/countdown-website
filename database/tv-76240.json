  "overview": "Expedition from Hell: The Lost Tapes unfolds a stranger-than-fiction story of Mickey Grosman, a former special forces demolitions expert who took a group of amateur adventurers on a nearly impossible journey across South America. Positioned as a charity trek for cancer awareness, participants were to be part of a 5,000-mile expedition across the continent through the deepest parts of the Amazon jungle. Only one claims to have made it to the end…Mickey Grosman.Expedition from Hell: The Lost Tapes uses the over 700 hours of archival footage shot from the trip to unfold a fascinating series of misfortunes and ineptitudes that quickly turned what was to be an already challenging expedition into a near constant struggle to survive. Tracing the rise and fall (and fall again) of a doomed adventure involving kidnapping, prison escapes, and a missing person, Expedition from Hell: The Lost Tapes uncovers brand new revelations that shock even those who were alongside Grosman during the ill-fated adventure.  ",
