  "overview": "Lycée Toulouse-Lautrec tells the story of a high school like no other. A high school that welcomes students with disabilities, such as Marie-Antoinette, a bubbly quadriplegic, or Charlie, suffering from a brain tumor. But also valid students, like Victoire, a young teenager forced to join this extraordinary place to follow her brother and who, although initially refractory, will gradually overcome her prejudices. There she will discover friendship, love, solidarity but also humor, courage and strength of all her classmates, as well as the devotion and altruism of parents and teachers.",
