  "overview": "Witches of Salem chronologically unravels the rapid descent of a town into madness, capturing the day-to-day hysteria that unfolds and puts an affluent New England community under siege. From reports of possession by the devil, to mass arrests, sensational trials and public hangings, each hour-long episode is an in-depth account of the eight months of \"satanic panic\" that overtook an otherwise sleepy Massachusetts village.",
