  "overview": "Who has the best survival strategies? Who does the desert bring to its knees? And for whom giving up is not an option? In the Thai jungle, twelve reality stars have to demonstrate their survival instincts in teams of two and exchange familiar comfort for new skills: Melissa Heitmann and Yasin Mohamed, Michaela Barresi and Kevin Schäfer, Michelle Daniaux and Dominik Brcic, Aurelia Lamprecht and Micha Student, Zoe Saip and Juliano Fernández as well as Jade Britani and Paco Herb. Which adventurous duo will be able to make their way and fly home with 20,000 euros in prizes? Joyn will bring the successful reality format \"Good Luck Guys\" from France to Germany for the first time, exclusively and free on Joyn starting November 9, 2023.",
