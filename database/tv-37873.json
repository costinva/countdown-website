  "overview": "Top Gun Holland is a reality series about the ultimate boyhood dream: Being an F16 pilot. For the first time, the viewer gets an open view into the very exclusive and especially heavy training needed to become a pilot of the Royal Air Force. The four-and-a-half year journey can be seen from beginning to end: from the tension and disappointment around the selection days to the mateless absence during training and the euphoria of the first solo air. The students, from every stage of the program, have been followed for more than a year. In the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal and America, the country where dreams come true for aspiring pilots also become reality.",
