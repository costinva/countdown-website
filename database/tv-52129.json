  "overview": "A small village in Belgium. A huge relay antenna. Birds falling from the sky. And little by little, some people turn invisible. For some, invisibility is a power; for others, it's a curse. Soon, the Unseen are perceived as a threat, and the authorities want to control them. A mystery drama showing how a community is affected by a strange phenomenon. What would happen if some of us had the power to go unseen? And what if we were the blind ones?",
