  "overview": "The untamed wildernesses of Africa encompass the extremes of our planet. Her primordial rhythm continues to beat across seasonal Grasslands, inhospitable Deserts, hazardous Coastlines and competitive Coral Reefs as it has for millennia. The plants and animals in each of these extraordinary landscapes have adapted to the unique demands of their region, rising to meet their daily challenges in astonishing ways. Africa's Deadly Kingdom delves deep into the complex lives of the continent's most remarkable species and their never-ending struggles to survive.",
