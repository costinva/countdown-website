  "overview": "Inspired by true events, Der Scheich tells the story of a one-of-a-kind con artist. Ringo, a simple man ridiculed as the village idiot in his hometown, reinvents himself as the heir of an Arabic fortune. With nothing but a bunch of tall tales and a fabricated bank statement for $8 billion, he becomes every Swiss investor's dream, bringing Switzerland's political and economic system to the brink of a national crisis.Â ",
