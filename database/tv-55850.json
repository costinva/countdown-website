  "overview": "Full-time mother Hong Nga-yau and her husband Yau Tsoi-shan have a two-year-old daughter called Yau Yat-tung. The family are under constant pressure as they and Nga-yau's parents Hong Lok and Fong Chor-kiu are living under the same roof. Tsoi-shan covertly plots to break free from Chor-kiu's control. But his parents Yau Tai-long and Kam Mei-foon keep making trouble, causing Tsoi-shan to be always in the wrong. There is constant conflict between Nga-yau and Tsoi-shan as the couple cannot agree on how to split parenting duties. Nga-yau insists on going to work. Meanwhile, stress and strife between \"the four elders\" is not melting away. Tsoi-shan's younger brother Yau Tsoi-fung and his wife Cheung Pik-chi, and Ngai-yau's elder cousin sister Ip Fan and her husband Kwan Chi-chung are faced with contradictions and hurdles with regards to raising children. In the process, children are invariably proved to be the key for parents to seize opportunities for life-long learning and maturation.",
