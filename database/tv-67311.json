  "overview": "Le Hai Ning is a 32-year-old editor-in-chief of a publishing company that is struggling to find a bestseller. Fang Cheng Hao, Hai Ning's boyfriend of nine years, is the only author doing well in her company but even his book sales have begun to stagnate. As Hai Ning is preparing for Cheng Hao's new book, she discovers some major misdeeds that he has done and Hai Ning becomes enraged. Leaving him, Hai Ning also decides to write the new book herself – a book about online dating and marriage – with a simple online ad that states: \"Female, 32 years old. Looking for men who are upright, kind and willing to communicate. Hoping to be friends first before marriage.\" ",
