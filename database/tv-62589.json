  "overview": "Wilderness revolves around British couple Liv and Will who seem to have it all: a rock-solid marriage; a glamorous new life in New York thousands of miles from their provincial hometown; and still young enough to feel that their whole lives are ahead of them. Until Liv learns about Will's affair. Heartbreak is swiftly followed by another emotion: fury. Revenge is her only option, and when Will proposes a trip around America's epic National Parks to give their relationship a fresh start, Liv knows just how to get itâ€¦ Wilderness is a twisted love story, where a dream holiday and a supposedly \"happily-ever-after\" quickly turns into a living nightmare.",
