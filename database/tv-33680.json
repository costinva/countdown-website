  "overview": "Step It Up &amp; Dance is a reality competition series where contestants will learn what it takes to make it big in the cutthroat dance industry. Elizabeth Berkley will serve as host andJerry Mitchell will mentor the 12 dancers chosen from around the country, as they master every conceivable dance style, from ballet and ballroom to Broadway and burlesque. Vincent Paterson and Nancy O'Meara will serve as judges for the competition. Whether it's a music video one week or a Vegas spectacular the next, Bravo's new dance series will feature challenges in which the dancers audition for a range of parts, designed to showcase their versatility and moves. As the competition gets fierce and contestants are eliminated, only one person will get the final \"call back\" and the chance to perform, with the ultimate dancer winning $100,000.",
