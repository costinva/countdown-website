  "overview": "Throughout this compelling four-part docuseries, music being the ultimate connector is explored in the chronicled journey to create the world's first Israeli-Palestinian pop group. Over a five year period, the band members share their ups and downs including the challenging audition process in 2020; their language barriers, intense rehearsals, emotional highs and lows as they found their footing; navigating the very unexpected world events that happened on October 7th, 2023 â€“ the morning after they flew to LA to record their first album; and the monumental challenges they have faced each day since. With so much more at stake because of the war, the band finds greater purpose in their music now representing something much greater than the six of them.The docuseries will also feature original music from the group including their debut single, \"All Eyes On Us,\" featuring Nile Rodgers as well as their upcoming single, \"Stranger,\" due this Friday, Nov. 15, and more.",
