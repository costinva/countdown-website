  "overview": "A riveting true crime docu-series, The Furry Detectives: Unmasking A Monster unpacks the 2018 event known in the Furry community as the \"Furry Zoosadist Leaks,\" which exposed a horrifying conspiracy of animal abuse lurking beneath the Fandom's playful exterior. The series follows the pack of dedicated vigilantes who teamed up to bring down the monsters behind the masks. Navigating the line between amateur sleuthing and official police investigation, the Furry Detectives exposed a ring of animal abusers, fought for victims, and defended their community from the evil within.",
