  "overview": "In order to distinguish itself from its corporate-run competition, a classic Vegas casino hires a young, unconventional doctor to live and work on the premises in order to give the guests personal, specialized care. When he correctly diagnoses and treats a star's sister, the grateful young woman agrees to headline at his casino, instead of at the bigger venues avidly courting her.",
