  "overview": "This is a film series that inspires hope. It shows the destruction we have caused in our waters, but also that it is possible to repair the damage we have caused. Over the course of three years, documentary filmmaker Martin Falklind and his team make a magical journey through Swedish rivers, lakes and seas, to an underwater world that most of us barely knew existed. In the series, we will see how we have fished out many of our waters, with collapsed ecosystems as a result. But we also get to see good and concrete examples that clearly show that it is possible to repair the damage and that it is possible to reverse the development for the better.",
