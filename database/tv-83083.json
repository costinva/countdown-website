Former President Bill Clinton and former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating reflect on leading a nation in mourning, while survivor Amy Downs relives the harrowing experience of being trapped in the rubble for hours. Edye Raines recalls the frantic search for her two missing children, and first responders, including district fire chief Mike Shannon, recall the desperate fight to save lives. FBI Special Agent in Charge Bob Ricks describes the race against time to find the bomber and bring him to justice. The series provides an intimate yet sweeping portrait of survival, courage and the pursuit of justice in the face of an unthinkable tragedy.",
