  "overview": "Oprah's Big Give, the new primetime series that defies television convention with the bold idea of people competing to give rather than get. A diverse, determined and competitive group of ten people are given the challenge of a lifetime - to change the lives of complete strangers in the most creative and dramatic ways. In this intense competition, the contestants criss-cross the country, scrambling to find ways to impact the fates and fortunes of unsuspecting people who are in for the surprise of their lives. Lives will be changed in the blink of an eye as contestants race against time to create once-in-a-lifetime experiences and also give away hundreds of thousands of dollars. Who will be the lucky few to get a \"Big Give\"â€¦ and who will get all that cash?\t",
