  "overview": "This new magazine, presented by Marie Drucker, focuses on \"Cold cases\". Closed cases, deemed insoluble, which have sometimes withstood the tenacity of investigators for nearly 50 years before a forgotten clue, unexpected testimony or innovative scientific expertise confuses the culprits. Alongside Marie Drucker, criminologist Alain Bauer sheds a technical, psychological, sociological or historical perspective on each case in order to understand the procedures implemented during the investigation, but also its issues and its repercussions. Each news item tells not only about the evolution of the investigation methods of the police and gendarmerie, but also an era, an environment, a region, a historical or social context. Through the story of the crimes and their resolution, Au bout de laquête will write a little-known page in the history of French society every Saturday. ",
