  "overview": "Set amid the competitive world of sales, Sticks and Stones centres on the personal and professional life of Thomas Benson, a hard-working father and husband. Reliant on bonuses and winning pitches, Thomas often finds himself leading the team when trying to secure new business. However, when he freezes during a pitch, the fall out is monumental.Determined to prove himself, Thomas goes to increasingly desperate lengths to remain successful. But, as he does, he begins to feel undermined, under attack and out of control. Has he lost his confidence and is just being paranoid or is his own team, and maybe the wider world, now out to get him?",
