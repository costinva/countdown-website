  "overview": "Eddie is a geeky porn editor whose low self-confidence has turned her into a 26-year-old hermit. Her friends, Eva (an unemployed artist), Lucy (an intern), and Chandaleer (a trainwreck/fashion model) vow to save her from her unhealthy solitude. When the friends decide to start a high-end escorting agency to earn more money, they convince skeptical Eddie to help them build their business and lift her self-esteem. Together they successfully navigate the adrenaline-fueled escorting industry with Eddie as their CEO and fellow sex worker.",
