  "overview": "Young Bum is a typical male chauvinist, and disbelieves a woman could ever understand a man's world. His pride won't let him admit to making mistakes.In contrast, another couple that lives nearby has a very modern attitude. The man does the housework, while the woman is the career worker. Obviously, comedy results from the interactions of these two very different families.",
