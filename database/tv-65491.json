  "overview": "George Mullen, a massively popular, but complicated, former American President is pulled from retirement to head a commission tasked with investigating a devastating global cyber-attack.Zero Day asks the question on everyone's mind â€” how do we find truth in a world in crisis, one seemingly being torn apart by forces outside our control? And in an era rife with conspiracy theory and subterfuge, how much of those forces are products of our own doing, perhaps even of our own imagining?",
