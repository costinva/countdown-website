  "overview": "Mirror Mirror on the wall – you know how it goes. But did you know that over 50% of people are dissatisfied with how they look?  Did you also know Australia has one of the highest per capita cosmetic surgery rates globally? In 10's upcoming two-part documentary Mirror Mirror, advertising and marketing guru Todd Sampson explores the societal crisis of body image dissatisfaction and the manipulative trillion-dollar industries that profit from it.  Todd lifts the lid on the beauty industry to discover an ugly side – how our obsession with beauty is exploited by the fitness, diet, and pornography industries and how our image-obsessed culture can easily lead to disorder.",
