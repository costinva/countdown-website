  "overview": "The harmony of a community is disrupted by an allegation of sexual assault on social media that names three teenagers as the culprits. The adults in charge of those mentioned, as aggressors and as victims, will have to deal with the tension of the situation and face their own relationship with sexuality. In the process they will discover that perhaps not only traditions are passed down from generation to generation, but also taboos and traumas.",
