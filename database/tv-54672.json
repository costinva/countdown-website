  "overview": "Hvaler is the story of 29-year-old Maria Blix, a young and newly trained psychologist full of ambition. She is in the midst of fierce career challenges when she is told that her father is dead. The message does not seem to affect her much, and she hesitantly travels back to the kingdom of her childhood on Hvaler to go to the funeral and meet the family she has hardly seen in the last ten years.",
