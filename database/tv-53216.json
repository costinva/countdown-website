  "overview": "When Nimrod is fired from his cushy high-tech job, he must find a way to restore his crumbled self-esteem and provide for his family. Rejection after rejection results in dwindling finances and forces him to accept his only offerâ€”in the kitchen of an upscale restaurant, run by one of Tel Aviv's most renowned chefs, a bachelor at the height of his professional career. Joining them is Sara, an exceptionally talented young chef who came from London just to work at the famed restaurant. Sara's charm ignites a new energy in the restaurant and casts both men under her spell. Dori attempts to win her heart by taking on the role of mentor, while Nimrod decides to fight for her at all costs. The unexpected love triangle forces all three to overcome their fears and anxieties and prepare for a new path.",
