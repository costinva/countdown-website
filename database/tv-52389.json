  "overview": "The world was captivated in the autumn of 2019, when the news first broke of the disappearance of 7-year-old JJ Vallow and his stepsister, 17-year-old Tylee Ryan, from their home in Rexburg, Idaho. As months passed, with no answers or clues to their whereabouts, police and family looked to their mother, 46-year-old Lori Vallow, for an explanation. Ten months later, in June 2020, a shocking discovery was made on the rural Idaho farm of Vallow's husband, Chad Daybell, leaving their friends, family, law enforcement -and the world - to wonder, what happened to JJ and Tylee?For the first time ever, America's number one destination in true crime takes a deeper look into the events that led up to these disappearances through the eyes of the grandparents who desperately prayed for their return.",
