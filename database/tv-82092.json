  "overview": "Lera is a sought-after obstetrician who works with the most prestigious patients, but her personal life has become unbearably difficult. After her husband's death, she is forced to raise three children alone. Despite this, Lera copes equally well both as a mother and as an obstetrician. But at some point, she still loses control over herself, which becomes one of the reasons for the tragedy during the birth of an important client. Now Lera can lose everything: her family, her job, and even her freedom. Will she be able to find the strength to revive her life without letting what is dear to her fall apart?",
