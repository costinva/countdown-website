  "overview": "In the sunbaked hills of British Columbia's wine country, maverick entrepreneur Bob Kay stays one step ahead of the law, and dreams of turning his medical marijuana dispensary into the biggest retail brand in pot. High on ambition, and rolling in cash, he keeps it all straight with the help of his wife, four children -- and loyal team of misfit workers. But with bud soon to be legalized -- big business and politicians are angling to put the little guy out of business -- can Bob take his small-town pot shop to the next level? Or will he, and countless other marijuana entrepreneurs just like him, soon be history?",
