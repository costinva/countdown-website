  "overview": "The series revolves around two New York City women who acted in an outrageous, campy, and decadent manner. Ellie Walker is a successful author of trashy romantic novels, and her best friend and publisher is Dorothy 'Dott' Emerson. Emerson is a divorced mother with a preppie college-aged son, Brendan Emerson, a College Republican, who rejects the relentless sexual advances of Ellie, but who otherwise appeared to be heterosexual.",
