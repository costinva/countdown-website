  "overview": "Naked and Afraid has dropped survivalists in pairs and in groups into the most remote areas of the world to endure the elements together. Through skill and teamwork, many have been able to face their fears and showcase what it takes to be stripped of everything, left completely vulnerable and survive the ultimate challenge. Now, the series takes the challenge to a new level by bringing the best of the best to the most isolated areas around the globe, leaving them there with nothing on their backs and no one by their side.",
