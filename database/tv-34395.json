  "overview": "Match is about Stian, an ordinary guy in the middle of twentieth with quite common mid-twenty-seven problems. The only thing that distinguishes Stian from others is the two sports commentators who, from their commentator bu, provide ongoing comments and analyzes of everything Stian does. Stian can not see them, but they see him. And commentators are more than willing to talk tactics, achievements and probable potential losses as soon as Stian faces a challenge.",
