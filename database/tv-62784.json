  "overview": "In his life-long obsession to develop new medicines to help people, Kanji Yakutani, a Japanese medical researcher, dies from overwork. To his immense surprise, he finds himself reborn in another world with a medieval culture, in which proper medical treatments are an affordable privilege to the wealthy only. In his new life as Pharma de MÃ©dicis, he discovers that he has been granted a divine blessing, which is common with that world's nobility, from Panactheos, the God of Medicine. With his divine blessing and his retained knowledge of modern medicine, Pharma decides to revolutionize the other world's medical advancements and make proper treatments affordable for the common folk.",
