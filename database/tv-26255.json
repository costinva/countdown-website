  "overview": "When his father has a heart attack, Royale Watkins, an Ivy Leaguer with a promising computer career in California, reluctantly agrees to take over the family contracting business in Washington, D.C., rather than sell to a rival. His sibling co-workers include fun-loving Randal and outspoken Tammy. The head of the household is Sylvia, the no-nonsense mother. The rest of the family consists of the eldest son, Robert, a stuffed-shirt architect, and Ryce, the youngest in the family.",
