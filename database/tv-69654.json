  "overview": "The Black Pirate animated series was created based on the famous novel by Emilio Salgari \"The Black Corsair\". The producer and one of the main screenwriters was Orlando Corradi, president of the Italian studio Mondo TV. There may also be some involvement of Japanese animators. The animated series tells the viewer about the noble sea robber Emilio Di Roccaner, nicknamed the Black Pirate, who wants to take revenge on the governor of Maracaibo Van Gulden for the death of his brother, the Red Pirate. Among the protagonist's associates, in addition to the fictional characters of the sailors Carmo, Van Steeler, the savage Moko and the witty pirate parrot of Dublin, there are also real historical figures, such as the French corsair Francois Olone and the lord of the filibuster sea Henry Morgan (in the film, the first assistant on the Black Pirate's ship).",
