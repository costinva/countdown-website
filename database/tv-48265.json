  "overview": "Unplug, relax, and refresh your senses for a moment of mindfulness with Walt Disney Animation Studios' Zenimation - an animated soundscape experience. Whether it's baby Moana being called by the ocean, Anna and Kristoff walking through an icy forest, or Baymax and Hiro Hamada flying over San Fransokyo, these iconic scenes become an aural experience like no other with the sounds of ocean waves, an icy forest and soaring flight.",
