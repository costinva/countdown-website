  "overview": "Over the past 3 years, both of them had grown apart. Venus decided to quit his job. He planned to return to his hometown to take a career break until his passion for work was reignited. In the meantime, he killed boredom through helping Janus, his older brother, who just opened a 24-hr. convenience store in a suburb. In the evenings, he would be responsible for small tasks such as delivering items to ‘regular customers' whose residences were located on his way home. But one day, Venus met a customer who he had never encountered before. To his surprise it turned out that this  customer was Sky, his former crush, who became a good-humored, highly energetic young doctor as always, despite mountains of workloads at the hospital. Upon seeing each other again, their new chapter of love story begins.",
