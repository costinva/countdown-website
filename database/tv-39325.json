Since the tragic loss of her daughter Marie, who disappeared eleven years ago without a trace, Freya lives a secluded and lonely life, with what keeps her going being the hope to eventually find out what happened to her daughter. When the only man who might give her information about Marie`s fate is released from prison and Freya's work confronts her with an abuse case similar to her daughter's, she sets out for a painful journey to finally get to the bottom of the truth â€“ whatever the cost might be.",
