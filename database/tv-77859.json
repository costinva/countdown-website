  "overview": "A new travelogue will see Simon journey to Scandinavia, travelling from the Arctic to the Baltic to uncover the secrets of this beautiful and extreme region. Nordic societies are known for their wealth and happiness, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impact of mass immigration have put them under new pressure. As well as showcasing some of the most spectacular scenery on earth, Scandinavia with Simon Reeve will reveal a hidden side to what has become one of the most important frontiers of Europe.Â ",
