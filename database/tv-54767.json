  "overview": "Dom Littlewood is being put to work like never before. In this series, he's joining the UK most essential workers. Embedded with the men and women who are keeping us moving, keeping the lights on and keeping us fed, not to mention looking after our animals, in each scenario he finds mentors to guide him through this immersive experience.
