  "overview": "Outrageous is the true story of six sisters who refused to play by the rules and whose often-scandalous lives made headlines around the world. Set against the gathering storm clouds of the 1930s, Outrageous will bring the full, uncensored story of the Mitford sisters to the screen for the first time - a story of family betrayals, public scandal, political extremism, personal heartache and even imprisonment. Refusing to conform to a world order that was collapsing around them, the show explores how and why these women were so ahead of their time - and what drove them to take their very different, complex and often extreme paths. A family saga like no other, this is the Mitfords as they really were: unapologetic, outrageous and utterly human. ",
