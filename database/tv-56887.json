  "overview": "Kill Thy Neighbour shows what happens when neighbourly feuds, grudges and flirtations are taken to murderous extremes, and tells of the predators hiding in plain sight in ordinary neighbourhoods. Intimate interviews with victims' families and investigating officers bring to life six stories of obsession, revenge, lust and madness, and what happens when the commandment to Love Thy Neighbour is forgotten.",
