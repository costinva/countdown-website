  "overview": "Klaus Kranitz considers \"normal\" couples therapy only to be expensive separation support. His self-made approach promises quick success. It brings stagnant togetherness back to life - in just a few sessions and with a money-back guarantee! For the unconventional couples therapist, no truth is too direct and no means too far-fetched to repair his clientele's relationships. Grimme Prize winner Jan Georg Schütte, director and co-author at the same time, brilliantly embodies the refined and cryptic title hero of the six-part series. The excellent cast used the playful freedom of the improv format to spontaneously develop the peculiarities and absurdities of their unusual characters in front of the camera. The successful ARD radio play \"Couples therapist Klaus Kranitz - Money back in the event of separation\" served as a template.",
