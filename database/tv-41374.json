  "overview": "Journalist Michelle McNamara was determined to find the violent offender she dubbed \"The Golden State Killer,\" who terrorized California in the late 1970s and early 1980s, committing 50 home-invasion sexual assaults and ten murders. I'll Be Gone in the Dark is a comprehensive exploration of the case of an elusive, violent predator, as well as a haunting personal memoir and self-examination of McNamara's obsessive quest for justice on behalf of the victims and survivors of the crimes.",
