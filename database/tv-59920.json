  "overview": "Told in part through the songs that she creates, Mood follows Sasha, a 25-year-old wannabe singer and rapper. She wants to be a major recording artist, but right now she's a bedroom artist: spending her days smoking weed and stalking her ex-boyfriend on Instagram, and avoiding her mum, her step-dad and sister Megan.When she is kicked out of her family home, Sasha is forced to fend for herself, sofa-surfing with local dealer Saleem, until she moves in with party girl Carly, who introduces her to the exciting world of social media influencing. But as the gap between her online presence and her dream of being a singer continues to grow, Sasha finds herself struggling to escape a world that is more complex and darker than she could have imagined.",
