The documentary series recounts the development of this technological innovation – led by Pan Am's chief executive Juan Trippe, pilot Charles Lindbergh, airplane engineer Igor Sikorsky and radio engineer Hugo Leuteritz – with dramatic re-enactments, interviews with historians and biographers, and archival photographs, newsreel clips and film.",
