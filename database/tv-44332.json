  "overview": "Welcome to the Primevères child psychiatry clinic. Marvin, a 17 years old teenager who is more accustomed to custody than medical exams, is interned after a court decision. He doesn't understands why he is here and makes it clear to the other residents and to the doctors. However, with Mélodie, Simon and Estelle, who have been in therapy for several weeks, they are going to shake up the daily life of the clinic while trying to find their own balance. Between recoveries and relapses, it is this new friendship that heals better than any pill.",
