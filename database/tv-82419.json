  "overview": "This three-part documentary series sees award-winning actor, presenter, and comedian Bradley Walsh fulfil a lifetime's ambition to visit the monuments of Ancient Egypt and try to understand how it could have been possible to produce such \"wonders of the ancient world\" 4,500 years ago.In this series, viewers will see Bradley as never before as he reveals his engineering passion and expertise and has many questions and theories that challenge Egyptological orthodoxy, getting close and personal with the monuments and history with which he has been fascinated throughout his life. With his Indiana Jones hat, his unique brand of entertainment and his unusual camel-riding technique, it's fair to say that Bradley is unlike anyone the Egyptians (ancient or modern) have ever encountered before.",
