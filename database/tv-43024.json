  "overview": "Extra is a new Modern Languages series aimed primarily at 14-16 year olds, but it will also be of interest to older students who would like to improve their French.Extra is an innovative new idea from 4Learning: a familiar sitcom in a sophisticated setting which covers all the main programmes of study and grammatical areas needed for success at GCSE/SG. The scripts have been carefully written for the target audience, and for those who find language learning difficult, the American protagonist, Sam, is there to come to their rescue. His efforts to get to grips with the language provide the central dynamic for the language learning content of the series.Sacha and Annie share a flat in Paris. They have a neighbour called Nico who fancies himself and Sacha. She doesn't return his affection but Annie does. Their landlady has very strict guidelines for the tenants and she regularly checks up on them.",
