Why did the Dutch authorities and the members of the Jewish Council co-operate so neatly with this terrible project, and how did the German occupier manage to persuade the Dutch authorities and the Dutch Jews to do so?In the five-part drama series, De Joodse Raad the unimaginable dilemmas that the German ruler presents the Jewish community are portrayed.",
