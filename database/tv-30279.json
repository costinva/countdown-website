  "overview": "MTV's new docu-series, If You Really Knew Me goes inside high schools across the country to discover what can happen when students peel back their public personas, break out of their cliques and show their peers who they really are. Each episode visits a different school, following five students as they tear down the walls that divide them through a transformative one-day program, \"Challenge Day\". Reminiscent of the film \"The Breakfast Club\", this real life series goes beneath the surface and behind the labels, ultimately uniting these students as they surprise each other with illuminating yet sometimes difficult truths about their lives.",
