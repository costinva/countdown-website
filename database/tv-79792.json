  "overview": "Open Mic is 10 programs with performances by almost 70 participants from different regions of Russia. These comedians were selected based on the results of the Big Standup Fest VK, which took place in May 2023. At the end of each Open Mic episode, the jury together with the host determines the funniest. These participants become participants in the new show from VK - Money Mic, the broadcasts of which start immediately after the release of Open Mic.",
