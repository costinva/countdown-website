  "overview": "Three people play together on stage. There will only be one winner at the end, so the candidates compete against each other, but they always play the quiz in groups of three. If one person from the group answers correctly, all three players are still in the running. If no one answers, all three people are eliminated and are replaced by the next three in the queue. If one person buzzes and answers incorrectly, they are also eliminated and the next person in the queue takes their place. The other two players remain in the race and the game continues with the next question. There are 90 seconds to buzz after the question has been named. The answer time after the buzzer is five seconds. A total of 25 quiz questions are asked. The player who buzzes the fastest on the 25th question and names the correct answer wins 100,000 euros.",
