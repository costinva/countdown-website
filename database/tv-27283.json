Series one and two showcased homes from all across Ireland including a converted workshop, a barn turned dream home, a radically transformed Dublin terrace and a self-built cob house to name but a few.Making the tough decisions on which homes go through to the final are our three expert judges; design legend Hugh Wallace, acclaimed architect Declan O'Donnell and award winning interior designer Deirdre Whelan.Looking for individuality, functionality and clever design, the judges individually score each of the homes out of 10, the home with the highest combined score in each programme goes through to the final, where the ultimate winner is crowned.",
