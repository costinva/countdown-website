  "overview": "Although there have always been transgender people, awareness of gender-fluidity has exploded into public consciousness in recent years with an increasing number of young people feeling less tethered to the gender they were born into and the gender roles expected of them.Genderquake explores the gender identities being adopted by a new generation of millennials. To get to the heart of the topic eleven young Brits will live together under one roof for one week. The eleven people come from across the spectrum of gender and sexuality and all have strong â€“ and varied - opinions on the subject. During their stay they will get the chance to get to know each other and explore their differing views. But with such a divisive topic at the heart of their stay, will anyone's opinions and viewpoints be swayed along the way with preconceptions changed by the end of their time together?",
