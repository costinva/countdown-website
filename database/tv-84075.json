  "overview": "Ena. La reina Victoria Eugenia is the story of a queen and also of a woman. Of a young Englishwoman who had never dreamed of being what she was: queen of Spain. On the journey, Victoria Eugenia leaves behind her family, her customs, her culture and has to renounce her religion to live in a strange land, where the first thing she suffers is an attack on her wedding day.She never felt accepted or loved, but she never gave up and always fought to achieve both. Modern in a traditional environment, she was an icon of fashion and of the liberation of feminine customs: she smoked, wore pants... When she discovered the continuous infidelities of King Alfonso XIII, she did not give up her role as queen. And she did so with discretion and, above all, resilience. She suffered the curse of transmitting hemophilia, to her husband's sorrow in view of the difficult dynastic succession that this entailed. In exchange, she improved the health of many Spaniards with a work which has gone down in history: the reconstruction of the Red Cross.ENA was a woman who fought to be happy with all her strength in a bitter period, in which she witnessed two world wars, a civil war and the deadly Spanish flu. For all these reasons, ENA, as a series, not only tells the story of Victoria Eugenia's life, it is also a portrait of an era that changed the world.",
