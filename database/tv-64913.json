  "overview": "The berserk expedition began in 2002 when Jarle Andh√∏y, Alex Rosen, The Tamil Sami and the man who is crowned King of the Animals set the world record for furthest north in a sailboat. The further aim was to sail in the wake of the Viking chieftain Ottar to the Garda Kingdom in order to establish ties of friendship with the fraternal people in the East after the fall of the Soviet Empire. But the expedition was kicked out of Spitsbergen by the Governor of Svalbard and therefore had to cancel the friendship voyage to Russia. After 3 trials and a verdict in 2004, Berserk completed the journey through Russia, but was tried to be stopped by the Police, Coast Guard, and the Russian Northern Fleet, because the King of the Animals has illegally communicated with a polar bear. Berserk, The Road to Valhall deals with the journey of the adventure voyage in Norwegian history from the Sami in northern Norway, to Russia's backyard, through the aura of the Soviet era and ends in Snorri Sturlasson's story about the Viking king Odin in his guildhalls in Valhall.",
