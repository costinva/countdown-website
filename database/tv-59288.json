  "overview": "Finding new sources of energy is a worldwide challenge. Modern societies are accustomed to citizens turning on lights at the flick of a switch, gassing up fast cars, and cheaply flying from city to city, but how will continued energy needs be met without damaging the planet? This series finds former \"Mythbusters\" host Kari Byron and British TV personality Dallas Campbell presenting innovators around the world who are creating new ways to power the future. Revealed are visionary large- and small-scale projects aimed at finding clean, renewable, affordable energy, and the hosts even help create a new energy installation.",
