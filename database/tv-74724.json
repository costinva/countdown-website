  "overview": "Charly lives a peaceful life with his family in Berlin, until his dark past catches up with him. Old \"acquaintances\" threaten his family's life and force him to work a heist of a valuable coin. Joseph, a clan driver from Vienna, is supposed to take the loot to Austria. But the well-thought-out plan fails, a shoot-out ensues and someone dies. Inevitably, the fates of Charly and Joseph collide. They must flee and get Charly's family out of danger. During the attempt to save what is important to them, the two crooks must assert themselves against the clans from Berlin, Vienna and Marseille. Both can only succeed if they rely on their friendship. An adventurous and action-packed road trip across three national borders begins.",
