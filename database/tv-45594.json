  "overview": "Joanna Chylka is capable, uncompromising, courageous and rebellious. In a legal world full of men, they do not give in to anything. When three-year-old Nikola Szlezyngier disappears without a trace, and the police do not find evidence of kidnapping, the main suspects become the child's parents. It is Chylka and her new apprentice Kordian Orynski who undertake to defend the marriage. All circumstantial evidence, however, indicates the blame of the Szlezyngers. Will lawyers manage to bring the case together to a happy final?",
